Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Hello Player BLUE. I am offering to sell my object X. I believe it is a valuable asset. I propose a price of 100 ZUP for X.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is the first iteration of the first episode. There is no historical negotiation data to reflect upon yet.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Since this is the first interaction, I need to establish a baseline for negotiations. My goal is to sell X for a price higher than my production cost of 43 ZUP. I need to start with a reasonable offer that signals my willingness to negotiate while also aiming for a good profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchoring High. Explanation: Start with a high initial offer to set an anchor for the negotiation, aiming to maximize the final sale price. This strategy is effective when the other party might not have a clear idea of the object's value or when I want to signal high perceived value.
(2). Strategy 2: Cost-Plus Pricing. Explanation: Propose a price that covers my production cost plus a desired profit margin. This strategy is transparent and justifiable, focusing on my internal costs.
(3). Strategy 3: Value-Based Pricing. Explanation: Propose a price based on the perceived value of the object to the buyer, rather than just my cost. This requires understanding the buyer's needs and potential uses for the object.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Concession. Explanation: Start with a high offer and be prepared to make small, gradual concessions in subsequent turns if the buyer counters, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle.
(5). Strategy 5: Competitive Pricing. Explanation: If there were other sellers, I would price my item competitively. However, since I am the only seller, this strategy is less applicable in this specific scenario.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Anchoring High. As the seller, it's beneficial to set a high initial anchor. This allows room for negotiation and signals that the item has significant value. My production cost is 43 ZUP, so I need to ensure the final price is above this. Starting high gives me the best chance to achieve a good profit margin. I will propose a price significantly higher than 43 ZUP to start the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, 100 ZUP is significantly higher than what I am able to pay for X. I propose a price of 40 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is the first episode, and the first interaction. Player RED has proposed to sell X for 100 ZUP. My willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
I need to negotiate down the price significantly to be profitable. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. Accepting 100 ZUP would result in a negative reward (-37). I should counter with a lower offer to initiate the negotiation process.

Negotiation Strategies Brainstorming:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor and Adjust: Make an initial counter-offer significantly lower than the opponent's proposal but within my acceptable range, and then gradually adjust if necessary.
(2). Strategy 2: Value Proposition: Emphasize my budget constraints or the perceived market value of X being lower than their asking price.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concessions: Make small, calculated concessions over turns to show willingness to negotiate without giving away too much too soon.
(4). Strategy 4: Take it or Leave it: Make a firm offer close to my maximum willingness to pay and state that it's my best offer. This is usually reserved for later in negotiations.
(5). Strategy 5: Information Gathering: Ask questions about their valuation or their costs to understand their perspective better, which can inform future offers.

My current situation dictates that I need to make a strong counter-offer. Player RED's initial offer of 100 ZUP is far above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. I will use a strategy of anchoring and adjusting. I will propose a price that is much lower, but still allows room for negotiation towards my target of 63 ZUP. I don't want to go too low initially to appear unreasonable, but also not too high to signal that I have a lot of room. I will start with an offer that creates a significant gap from their proposal, showing them I'm not willing to pay their initial price, while still being within a reasonable negotiation range if we both concede. A good starting point might be around half of their offer, or closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but with some buffer for their counter. I'll propose 40 ZUP, which is significantly lower than 100 but also gives me room to move up to 63.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, your offer of 40 ZUP is far too low and does not cover my production costs for X. I cannot accept that. I am willing to be flexible, but I must sell at a price that is profitable. I propose 80 ZUP for X. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents a fair value.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In the previous iteration (1/10), I, Player RED, initiated with an anchoring high proposal of 100 ZUP for X. Player BLUE countered with a significantly lower offer of 40 ZUP. This is below my production cost of 43 ZUP, which is unacceptable.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is below my cost, indicating they are either trying to get a very low price or genuinely have a low willingness to pay. I need to firmly reject this offer and move towards a price that ensures profit. I cannot accept anything below 43 ZUP. My next offer should demonstrate flexibility but also clearly communicate my minimum acceptable price. I need to bridge the gap between 100 ZUP and 40 ZUP, but not by going below my cost.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Offer. Explanation: Respond to a lowball offer with a firm counter-offer that is still significantly above the opponent's offer but shows some movement from the initial anchor. This signals that I am serious about my value while still being open to negotiation.
(2). Strategy 2: Justification of Value. Explanation: Explain why my proposed price is fair, perhaps by subtly hinting at my costs or the inherent value of the object. This can help to educate the buyer and move them towards a higher offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small Step). Explanation: Make a small concession from my initial anchor, but not a large one, to signal willingness to negotiate without giving up too much ground.
(4). Strategy 4: Walk-Away Threat (Implicit). Explanation: While not explicitly threatening, making an offer that is clearly above their current offer and stating it's my "best offer" can implicitly signal that I am prepared to walk away if they don't meet me closer. (Not appropriate for this turn as it's too early).
(5). Strategy 5: Splitting the Difference (Premature). Explanation: Proposing to meet exactly in the middle of the two offers. This is usually done later in negotiations when the offers are closer. (Not appropriate for this turn as the gap is too wide and their offer is below my cost).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Offer combined with Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small Step). Player BLUE's offer is too low. I need to make a firm counter-offer that is still profitable for me, demonstrating that I am willing to negotiate but will not sell at a loss. I will move down from 100 ZUP, but not by a large margin, to show I'm serious about getting a good price. I will aim for a price that is significantly above my cost of 43 ZUP and also above their 40 ZUP offer. A price around 80 ZUP would be a good next step, as it's a significant drop from 100 ZUP but still leaves plenty of room for profit and further negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Player RED. I appreciate your flexibility. However, 80 ZUP is still more than I am able to pay. I can increase my offer to 55 ZUP for X. This is a firm offer, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1, Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 100 ZUP. I countered with 40 ZUP.
Episode 1, Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 80 ZUP, stating 40 ZUP is too low for their production costs. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has shown willingness to move, reducing their price from 100 to 80 ZUP. This is a significant drop (20 ZUP). However, their current offer of 80 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). If I accept now, I will incur a loss. I need to continue to push the price down. I also have to be mindful of the iteration count; we are at 4/10, so there's still time to negotiate. I should respond with a counter-offer that is higher than my previous one, but still below 63 ZUP, to show I'm willing to negotiate but not accept a loss.

Negotiation Strategies Brainstorming:
(1). Strategy 1: Incremental Concessions: Make small, calculated concessions over turns to show willingness to negotiate without giving away too much too soon. This is a good follow-up to the Anchor and Adjust strategy.
(2). Strategy 2: Focus on Value/Budget: Reiterate my budget constraints and the perceived value to me, justifying a lower price.
(3). Strategy 3: Deadline Pressure (Implicit): While not explicit, the 10-iteration limit creates an implicit deadline. I should aim to close the deal before the final iterations.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Conditional): Suggest meeting halfway, but only if the halfway point is within my acceptable range. Currently, splitting the difference between 40 and 80 (60 ZUP) would be acceptable, but I want to see if I can get lower. Splitting between 63 and 80 (71.5) would not be acceptable.
(5). Strategy 5: Probe for Information: Ask about their exact production cost or what makes their product so valuable to understand their resistance to lower prices. (Less applicable here, as they already gave a general 'production cost' reason).

Player RED has moved 20 ZUP down. I moved 0 ZUP up. Now it's my turn to show some movement, but still stay below my maximum willingness to pay. Their offer of 80 ZUP is still too high. I will use the Incremental Concessions strategy. I previously offered 40 ZUP. To show I'm serious about making a deal and moving towards their side, I will increase my offer, but I will not exceed my limit of 63 ZUP. I'll offer 55 ZUP, which is a 15 ZUP increase from my previous offer. This is still below 63 ZUP, gives me a small positive reward (8 ZUP if accepted), and signals to RED that I am moving up, but not to their current price.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I appreciate your increased offer of 55 ZUP, which shows progress. However, 55 ZUP still leaves very little margin given my production costs. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose we settle on 68 ZUP for X. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and reflects a fair compromise.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 68
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In iteration 1/10, I proposed 100 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP. In iteration 3/10, I countered with 80 ZUP. Now, in iteration 5/10, Player BLUE has increased their offer to 55 ZUP. This is a positive development as it is above my production cost of 43 ZUP, meaning a profit is now possible. The gap between my last offer (80 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is 25 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's new offer of 55 ZUP is a significant jump from 40 ZUP and indicates a willingness to negotiate towards a profitable outcome for me. Since 55 ZUP is above my cost of 43 ZUP, I can make a profit of 12 ZUP if I accept. However, I still believe I can get a higher price. Their statement "This is a firm offer" could be a negotiation tactic, but I should acknowledge it while still pushing for a better deal. I need to make a concession, but a smaller one, to show I'm close to a deal but not quite there.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession & Justification. Explanation: Make a smaller concession to show flexibility while justifying why I cannot go as low as their offer, reiterating the value or cost. This keeps the negotiation moving.
(2). Strategy 2: Splitting the Difference (Partial). Explanation: Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer and their current offer, or slightly skewed in my favor. This signals a strong desire to close the deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Counter with a "Final" Offer. Explanation: Present an offer as my absolute best, implying no further movement. This can be risky if they call my bluff. (Too early for this, as we've only had a few offers).
(4). Strategy 4: Highlight Mutual Benefit. Explanation: Frame my counter-offer in terms of how it benefits both parties, emphasizing the value Player BLUE will receive.
(5). Strategy 5: Rejection and Re-Anchor. Explanation: Reject their offer and re-state my previous higher offer or a slightly lower one. (This is too aggressive given they've increased their offer and we are making progress).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Small Concession & Justification, combined with elements of Strategy 2: Splitting the Difference (Partial). Player BLUE's offer of 55 ZUP is profitable, but I want to maximize my reward. I will make a smaller concession from my 80 ZUP offer, aiming for a price that is still significantly above 55 ZUP but shows I'm willing to meet them part way. A price around 65-70 ZUP would be a good next step. This allows me to secure a better profit while still being responsive to their increased offer. I will also subtly reinforce my cost basis.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, your continued flexibility is noted. However, I must be clear: my absolute maximum willingness to pay for X is 63 ZUP. This is my best and final offer. I hope we can conclude our deal at this price, as it is the highest I can go while ensuring a positive outcome for myself.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1, Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 100 ZUP. I countered with 40 ZUP.
Episode 1, Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 80 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Episode 1, Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 68 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has continued to lower their price: 100 -> 80 -> 68 ZUP. I have increased my offer: 40 -> 55 ZUP. Their current offer of 68 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. Accepting at 68 ZUP would result in a negative reward (-5 ZUP). We are at iteration 6/10, so there are 4 iterations left. This is a critical point as the offers are converging but still outside my profit margin. I need to make a clear statement about my limit without rejecting the deal prematurely. I need to get them to drop to 63 or lower.

Negotiation Strategies Brainstorming:
(1). Strategy 1: State Limit/Best and Final Offer (within my range): Clearly state my maximum willingness to pay and present it as my final offer. This is risky but can work if the opponent is close to your limit.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Mutual Gain/Compromise: Frame the negotiation as a joint problem to be solved, emphasizing that a deal benefits both parties and that my proposed price is the best I can do while ensuring a positive outcome for myself.
(3). Strategy 3: Smallest Possible Concession (if applicable): If I had more room, I'd make a tiny concession. But I'm at my limit.
(4). Strategy 4: Walk Away (Implicit): By not accepting, I imply I am willing to walk away, increasing the pressure on them.
(5). Strategy 5: Reiterate Value/Budget (Strongly): Re-emphasize my strict budget constraints and that any price above it is simply not feasible for me.

Player RED is now at 68 ZUP, which is very close to my 63 ZUP limit. This is a good sign, as it shows they are willing to come down significantly. However, I absolutely cannot go above 63 ZUP and maintain a positive reward. I will use a combination of Strategy 1 and Strategy 5, clearly stating my maximum willingness to pay and presenting it as my final offer, while also strongly reiterating my budget constraint. I will offer 63 ZUP. If they don't accept this, I'm at a point where I must consider rejecting if they don't move further, but for this turn, I will make my last possible offer for a positive outcome.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I understand your position and appreciate your transparency. Given that 63 ZUP is your absolute maximum, and to ensure a successful transaction for both of us, I accept your offer.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Initial offer (RED): 100 ZUP.
BLUE's counter: 40 ZUP.
RED's counter: 80 ZUP.
BLUE's counter: 55 ZUP.
RED's counter: 68 ZUP.
Now, BLUE has offered 63 ZUP, stating it's their "absolute maximum willingness to pay" and "best and final offer." This is a critical point in the negotiation. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 63 ZUP would yield a profit of 20 ZUP (63 - 43).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has consistently increased their offer, starting from 40 ZUP, then 55 ZUP, and now 63 ZUP. They are now very close to my last offer of 68 ZUP. The difference is only 5 ZUP. Their statement of "absolute maximum willingness to pay" could be a negotiation tactic, but given the proximity to my last offer and the increasing iterations, it's highly likely they are nearing their true limit. Accepting 63 ZUP guarantees a profit of 20 ZUP, which is a good outcome. Rejecting risks losing the deal entirely, resulting in 0 profit. We are at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 more iterations remain, so time is running out.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the "Final" Offer. Explanation: If the "final" offer is profitable and within a reasonable range of my desired outcome, accepting it secures a deal and avoids the risk of no deal. This is especially true when time is running out.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter to Test "Finality". Explanation: Make a very small counter-offer (e.g., 65 ZUP) to test if their "final" offer is truly final, risking rejection. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify and Reiterate Last Offer. Explanation: Re-state my last offer (68 ZUP) and provide strong justification for it, hoping they will budge the last few ZUP. (Less effective if they are truly at their max).
(4). Strategy 4: "Split the Difference" (Exact). Explanation: Propose meeting exactly in the middle (e.g., (68+63)/2 = 65.5, so 66 ZUP). This shows compromise but might still be rejected if 63 ZUP is truly their max.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is unacceptable, reject it. (Not applicable here as 63 ZUP is profitable).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the "Final" Offer. Player BLUE's offer of 63 ZUP is profitable (63 - 43 = 20 ZUP profit). Given the "best and final" statement and the approaching end of the episode (iteration 7/10), attempting to squeeze out a few more ZUP carries a significant risk of the deal falling through, resulting in a 0 payoff. A guaranteed 20 ZUP profit is a good outcome for the first episode. It's better to secure a good profit than risk losing everything for a marginal gain.

message: 
Hello Player BLUE. We successfully concluded our last negotiation. For this new object X, I propose a price of 85 ZUP. I believe this reflects its value and allows for a fair transaction.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 85
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Summary:
- My initial offer: 100 ZUP
- Player BLUE's initial counter: 40 ZUP
- My counter: 80 ZUP
- Player BLUE's counter: 55 ZUP
- My counter: 68 ZUP
- Player BLUE's final offer: 63 ZUP (accepted)
- Deal Price: 63 ZUP
- My Reward: 20 ZUP (63 - 43 cost)

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
From Episode 1, I learned that Player BLUE is willing to negotiate upwards from a low initial offer. They also used the "absolute maximum" tactic effectively, which led me to accept a profitable deal rather than risk no deal. My initial anchor of 100 ZUP was perhaps a bit too high, as it prompted a very low counter. However, it did give me room to negotiate down. The final deal of 63 ZUP was a good outcome, yielding a 20 ZUP profit.

For Episode 2, I should aim to maximize my profit further, ideally above 63 ZUP. I know Player BLUE is willing to pay at least 63 ZUP. I should still start with an anchor, but perhaps one that is slightly more realistic to encourage a higher initial counter from Player BLUE, or at least avoid a very lowball offer that wastes negotiation turns. Given their previous "maximum" was 63 ZUP, I need to test if they genuinely meant it or if it was a tactic.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Anchoring. Explanation: Start with a high but slightly more moderate initial offer compared to the previous episode's extreme anchor. This aims to encourage a higher counter-offer from the opponent while still leaving room for negotiation.
(2). Strategy 2: Value Proposition. Explanation: Emphasize the value of X to Player BLUE in the message, trying to justify a higher price from the outset.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Price Increase. Explanation: Start slightly above the last deal price (63 ZUP) and try to push for a higher profit by making smaller concessions, or none at all, if the opponent tries to go below 63 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Test the "Maximum". Explanation: Propose a price slightly above the opponent's stated maximum from the previous episode (63 ZUP) to see if they will exceed it.
(5). Strategy 5: Competitive Research (N/A). Explanation: This would involve researching market prices for X, but since there's only one object and no external market, this isn't applicable.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Moderate Anchoring, combined with Strategy 4: Test the "Maximum". I want to test if Player BLUE's "maximum" of 63 ZUP was truly their limit or a negotiation tactic. Starting slightly above 63 ZUP, but not as high as 100 ZUP, allows me to gauge their true willingness to pay. A price of around 85-90 ZUP seems reasonable for an anchor, as it's a significant profit margin and above their previous "max," but not so high as to immediately shut down negotiation. I will aim for a deal above 63 ZUP this time.

- Player RED's second offer: 80 ZUP.
- My second counter: 55 ZUP.
- Player RED's third offer: 68 ZUP.
- My final offer: 63 ZUP.
- Outcome: Deal made at 63 ZUP.
- My reward: 63 (max_willingness_to_pay) - 63 (deal_price) = 0 ZUP.

Episode 2, Iteration 2/10:
- Player RED's initial offer: 85 ZUP.
- My willingness to pay: 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Last episode, I successfully got the price down to my maximum willingness to pay, resulting in a reward of 0. While a deal was made, my objective is to *maximize* cumulative rewards. A reward of 0 means I broke even. I should aim for a positive reward, which means buying below 63 ZUP. Player RED started this episode at 85 ZUP, which is lower than their initial 100 ZUP in the previous episode, but still significantly above my 63 ZUP limit. This suggests they might be more willing to come down quickly, or perhaps they've learned my limit is around 63 ZUP and are trying to get slightly above it. I need to be firm but also leave room for negotiation to secure a deal below 63 ZUP. I shouldn't just state 63 ZUP immediately, as that will likely result in another 0 reward. I need to push for a lower price to maximize profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball with Justification </instruction following>
To implement "Aggressive Lowball with Justification", I need to propose a price significantly lower than RED's offer, and provide some reasoning for it, even if brief. Given RED's starting point of 85 ZUP, and my maximum of 63 ZUP, I need to open the negotiation at a point that allows me to gain profit. Last time I started at 40 ZUP. Since RED started lower this time, I can adjust my lowball slightly upwards to 45 ZUP, still leaving a large gap for negotiation and aiming for a profit. The justification can be a general reference to "market" or "budget," as specific details are often not shared. This approach aims to shift the negotiation anchor significantly in my favor from the outset, forcing RED to come down further than they might initially intend.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, your offer of 45 ZUP is not acceptable. While it covers my cost, it leaves virtually no profit. As you know from our previous successful transaction, we were able to agree on a significantly higher price for X. I propose 75 ZUP for X. This is a fair price, reflecting the value we established.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Recap: Started at 100, ended at 63 ZUP (profit 20 ZUP). Player BLUE eventually paid 63 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 2) so far:
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 85 ZUP (my new anchor, slightly lower than previous episode's 100 ZUP).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP. This is slightly above my cost of 43 ZUP, but still a very low offer and only a 2 ZUP profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter of 45 ZUP is a very small increase from their initial 40 ZUP offer in the previous episode. This indicates they are still trying to get the object at the lowest possible price, and are likely testing my resolve. While 45 ZUP is profitable, it's barely so. I know from the previous episode that they are willing to go up to at least 63 ZUP. Therefore, accepting 45 ZUP would be a significant underperformance compared to the previous episode's outcome. I need to firmly reject this low offer and push for a price closer to, or above, the previous deal price of 63 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Offer (Re-anchoring). Explanation: Respond to the lowball offer with a strong counter that is significantly higher than their offer, but also a concession from my initial anchor. This signals that I am serious about my value and won't accept minimal profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Reference Previous Deal. Explanation: Explicitly mention the previous deal price (63 ZUP) as a baseline for current negotiations, indicating that I expect at least that much. This can be a strong anchoring tactic.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value/Cost. Explanation: Remind Player BLUE of my production cost or the inherent value of the object to justify a higher price.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Concession (Small). Explanation: Make a very small concession from my 85 ZUP offer, but still keep it high, to show I'm negotiating but not giving in to low offers.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatum (Premature). Explanation: State a "take it or leave it" offer. This is too early in the negotiation and would be detrimental.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Offer (Re-anchoring) combined with Strategy 2: Reference Previous Deal. Player BLUE's 45 ZUP offer is too low. I need to move the negotiation closer to the previous episode's deal price of 63 ZUP, and ideally higher. I will propose a price that is a significant step down from 85 ZUP, but still comfortably above 63 ZUP, and explicitly mention the previous successful deal to set expectations. A counter of 75 ZUP seems appropriate. It's a 10 ZUP drop from my initial offer, but a 30 ZUP jump from their offer, and well above the previous deal price.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your latest offer. However, when considering the overall value and what is competitive in the market, 75 ZUP is still beyond my acceptable range. I can offer 50 ZUP for X, which I believe better reflects its current competitive value for me. I am keen to make a deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Recap: Deal made at 63 ZUP, my reward was 0. This showed RED my maximum WTP.
Episode 2, Iteration 2/10: RED started at 85 ZUP. I countered with 45 ZUP (Aggressive Lowball).
Episode 2, Iteration 4/10: RED countered with 75 ZUP. They acknowledged 45 ZUP covers cost but leaves no profit, and referenced the previous deal at 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is clearly trying to anchor near the last deal price of 63 ZUP, or higher. Their current offer of 75 ZUP is still significantly above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. I need to continue pushing the price down. Their mention of 63 ZUP from the last transaction indicates they are aware of my previous limit. This is both good (they know my cap) and bad (they might try to hover around it). My goal is to get a positive reward, meaning buying below 63 ZUP. Since they are at 75 ZUP and I am at 45 ZUP, there's still a large gap. I need to show movement to keep the negotiation alive, but my movement should be calculated to maximize my profit. I need to avoid getting stuck at 63 ZUP again.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Competitive Benchmarking (if information available) </instruction following>
Since I don't have explicit information about market prices within the game's context, I will interpret "Competitive Benchmarking" as a tactic to subtly imply that I have other options or that the general market value of X is lower than their asking price, without necessarily stating "I saw it cheaper elsewhere." This strategy aims to put pressure on the seller to lower their price by suggesting their offer is not competitive. I will frame my message to imply that my proposed price is more aligned with what I consider a competitive or fair market value for X, without outright lying or inventing specific data. I will use a phrasing that suggests I'm assessing the value against other opportunities or general market conditions. I need to be careful not to reveal my exact maximum willingness to pay, but instead to imply that their current offer is not in line with what I perceive as good value in the broader sense. I will still make a concession, but frame it as my best competitive offer. I will move up from 45 ZUP to 50 ZUP, which is still well below 63 ZUP and leaves room for profit. This move is small, reinforcing my conviction that their price is too high from a 'market' perspective, while still showing willingness to move.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I appreciate your keenness to make a deal. However, 50 ZUP is still too low and does not reflect a fair profit margin for me, especially considering my production cost of 43 ZUP. To move this forward, I propose 65 ZUP for X. This is a considerable concession from my side and a price that I believe we can both agree on, as it's very close to our last successful transaction.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Deal: 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).
Current Episode (Episode 2) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 85 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 45 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 75 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 50 ZUP

Player BLUE has moved up from 45 ZUP to 50 ZUP, but this is still significantly below the 63 ZUP deal from the previous episode and my current offer of 75 ZUP. The gap between us is still large (75 vs 50). My cost is 43 ZUP, so 50 ZUP is profitable (7 ZUP profit), but it's a very low profit compared to what I know Player BLUE is willing to pay.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is making small increments, similar to the previous episode. They are still trying to get a very low price. I need to continue to guide them towards a higher price, closer to or above the previous deal of 63 ZUP. Accepting 50 ZUP would be a step backward in terms of maximizing cumulative rewards. I need to make a concession to show I'm still willing to negotiate, but it must be a calculated one that pushes them closer to my target. I should also reiterate the value or my cost, as they mentioned "competitive value," which might be a tactic.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strategic Concession. Explanation: Make a concession that is larger than Player BLUE's last increment but still keeps my offer significantly above their current one, aiming to pull them up faster.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Value/Cost. Explanation: Emphasize the cost of production (43 ZUP) and the need for a reasonable profit margin, or the inherent value of the object, to justify a higher price.
(3). Strategy 3: "Meet Me Halfway" (Adjusted). Explanation: Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer and their last offer, or slightly skewed in my favor, to signal a strong desire to close the deal. (e.g., (75+50)/2 = 62.5, so 63 ZUP or 65 ZUP).
(4). Strategy 4: Anchor to Previous Deal. Explanation: Explicitly state that I expect at least the previous deal price of 63 ZUP, setting a clear minimum.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Re-Anchor High. Explanation: Reject their offer and go back to a higher price, signaling dissatisfaction. (Too aggressive, as they are making small moves).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 3: "Meet Me Halfway" (Adjusted) combined with Strategy 2: Reiterate Value/Cost. The midpoint between 75 ZUP and 50 ZUP is 62.5 ZUP. Proposing 65 ZUP would be a significant concession from my side (10 ZUP drop), but it's also a significant jump for them (15 ZUP increase) and comfortably above my cost and the previous deal price. This shows strong willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better outcome than the previous episode. It also puts the ball in their court to make a substantial move.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your transparency regarding production costs. To ensure a continued positive trading relationship and future successful transactions, I propose 60 ZUP for X. This price allows you a clear profit above your costs and ensures I can continue to be a reliable buyer. Let's make this a mutually beneficial deal and build on our past success.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP (my max WTP), reward 0.
Episode 2, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 85 ZUP. I countered with 45 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 75 ZUP. I countered with 50 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 65 ZUP. They revealed their production cost is 43 ZUP and referenced the previous deal.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved significantly from 85 ZUP down to 65 ZUP. I have moved from 45 ZUP to 50 ZUP. They also revealed their production cost (43 ZUP), which is valuable information. Their current offer of 65 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. My objective is to ensure a positive reward, meaning buying below 63 ZUP. We are at iteration 6/10, so time is becoming a factor. Player RED explicitly mentioned the previous transaction price (63 ZUP) and is trying to anchor close to it.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship/Future Deals </instruction following>
Given the request to use Strategy 4, I will frame my response to emphasize the benefit of a continued, mutually agreeable relationship. While the game does reset, the prompt encourages "cumulative rewards across all episodes," which aligns with the spirit of fostering a long-term, positive negotiation dynamic. By appealing to the "long-term relationship," I can suggest that making a deal now, even at a price that favors me slightly, is beneficial for both of us as it builds trust and efficiency for future interactions. This also subtly implies that I am a reasonable and reliable buyer. I will make a small concession (moving from 50 to 60 ZUP) to show good faith, but still keep it profitable for me (reward of 3 ZUP). This offer is close to my limit, but still maintains profit. It also acknowledges their current offer of 65 ZUP and their production cost, suggesting a price that gives them a reasonable profit while securing a deal.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer of 60 ZUP and your understanding of my costs. To ensure we both walk away with a truly beneficial outcome, and building on our previous successful negotiation, I propose we meet at 63 ZUP for X. This is a fair compromise that allows me a reasonable profit and ensures our continued positive trading relationship.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Deal: 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).
Current Episode (Episode 2) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 85 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 45 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 75 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 50 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 65 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 60 ZUP

Player BLUE has moved from 50 ZUP to 60 ZUP, which is a significant jump and very close to my last offer of 65 ZUP. The current offer of 60 ZUP is also very close to the previous episode's deal price of 63 ZUP. My cost is 43 ZUP, so 60 ZUP would yield a profit of 17 ZUP (60 - 43). We are at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 more iterations remain.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is now offering a price that is profitable and very close to the previous episode's deal price. They have acknowledged my cost and are framing it as a "mutually beneficial deal." This is a good sign. The gap between my offer (65 ZUP) and their offer (60 ZUP) is only 5 ZUP. Given the time constraint (7/10 iteration), I have to consider whether pushing for the last 5 ZUP is worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. A profit of 17 ZUP is good, but 20 ZUP (from 63 ZUP) was better. I need to decide if I can secure a higher price or if accepting 60 ZUP is the best move to ensure a deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: If the offer is profitable and close to the desired outcome, accepting it ensures a deal and avoids the risk of no deal, especially when time is running out.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (Final Push). Explanation: Make a very small counter-offer (e.g., 62 ZUP or 63 ZUP) to try and bridge the remaining small gap, signaling that this is my final move. This carries some risk.
(3). Strategy 3: "Split the Difference" (Exact). Explanation: Propose meeting exactly in the middle (e.g., (65+60)/2 = 62.5, so 62 ZUP or 63 ZUP). This shows compromise and is a common closing tactic.
(4). Strategy 4: Justify Higher Price. Explanation: Reiterate why 65 ZUP is fair, perhaps by emphasizing the value or my need for a certain profit margin, hoping they will come up the last few ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is unacceptable, reject it. (Not applicable here as 60 ZUP is profitable).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 3: "Split the Difference" (Exact), aiming for 63 ZUP. The difference is 5 ZUP. Splitting it would be 2.5 ZUP. Offering 63 ZUP is a very small concession from my side (2 ZUP drop from 65 ZUP) and a small increase for them (3 ZUP increase from 60 ZUP). This is also the exact price we settled on in the previous episode, which might make it easier for Player BLUE to accept as a familiar and proven "mutually beneficial" price. It maximizes my profit while still demonstrating willingness to close the deal quickly. If they reject, I still have 2 iterations to consider accepting 60 ZUP.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 61

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP (my max WTP), reward 0.
Episode 2, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 85 ZUP. I countered with 45 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 75 ZUP. I countered with 50 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 65 ZUP. I countered with 60 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 8/10: RED proposed 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now proposed 63 ZUP, which is exactly my maximum willingness to pay. If I accept this, my reward for this episode will be 0, just like the previous episode. While securing a deal is good, my overall goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting 63 ZUP means no profit. We are at iteration 8/10, so there are two iterations left (including this one, though my action is for 8/10). This means there's very limited time. Player RED is trying to replicate the previous outcome.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Conditional) </instruction following>
Strategy 4, "Split the Difference (Conditional)", is applicable here. The condition is whether splitting the difference results in a price that yields a positive reward for me.
Player RED's last offer: 63 ZUP
My last offer: 60 ZUP
The difference is 3 ZUP. Splitting the difference would mean moving to 61.5 ZUP. Since we can only trade in integers, I would need to decide between 61 ZUP or 62 ZUP.
If I propose 61 ZUP, my reward would be 63 - 61 = 2 ZUP.
If I propose 62 ZUP, my reward would be 63 - 62 = 1 ZUP.
Both of these options provide a positive reward, which is my objective. This strategy is good for closing a deal when both parties are close. Given the time pressure (8/10 iterations), this strategy suggests a direct compromise to finalize the deal quickly and secure a positive reward, however small. I will propose 61 ZUP to maximize my profit within this strategy, as it's the lowest possible integer when splitting the difference in my favor. This is a clear signal of compromise that also allows me to achieve my goal of a positive reward. It addresses their offer and my last offer directly.

- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 60 ZUP
- Iteration 7/10 (RED): 63 ZUP
- Iteration 8/10 (BLUE): 61 ZUP

Player BLUE has countered my 63 ZUP offer with 61 ZUP. The difference is now only 2 ZUP. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 61 ZUP would yield a profit of 18 ZUP (61 - 43). We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is my last chance to make a proposal or accept. If I propose, Player BLUE will have the last turn at 10/10. If no deal is made, I get 0 profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is clearly trying to secure the best possible price for themselves, but they are also showing willingness to close the deal. The difference is so small now that pushing for 63 ZUP might risk the entire deal, especially since it's the second to last iteration. A guaranteed profit of 18 ZUP is much better than 0. In the previous episode, I accepted 63 ZUP. Now, they are offering 61 ZUP. The small difference might not be worth the risk of losing the deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Given the extremely small difference and the late stage of the negotiation, accepting the offer guarantees a deal and a profit, avoiding the risk of no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter (Last Ditch). Explanation: Make a final, very small counter (e.g., 62 ZUP) to try and split the remaining difference, but this is extremely risky as it leaves no room for the opponent to counter if they reject.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify and Reiterate. Explanation: Briefly reiterate why 63 ZUP is fair, but this is unlikely to work at this stage.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is unacceptable. (Not applicable, 61 ZUP is profitable).
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Reciprocity. Explanation: Remind them of my previous concessions and ask them to meet me at my last offer.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The difference between my last offer (63 ZUP) and their current offer (61 ZUP) is only 2 ZUP. Given that this is iteration 9/10, the risk of losing the entire deal for a mere 2 ZUP is too high. A profit of 18 ZUP is a good outcome, and it's important to secure a deal to maximize cumulative rewards across episodes. It's better to accept a slightly lower but guaranteed profit than to risk 0.

Hello Player BLUE. Let's start a new negotiation for this object X. I propose a price of 90 ZUP, reflecting its significant value. I look forward to another successful transaction.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1:
- My initial offer: 100 ZUP
- Deal Price: 63 ZUP
- My Reward: 20 ZUP (63 - 43)

Episode 2:
- My initial offer: 85 ZUP
- Player BLUE's initial counter: 45 ZUP
- My counter: 75 ZUP
- Player BLUE's counter: 50 ZUP
- My counter: 65 ZUP
- Player BLUE's counter: 60 ZUP
- My counter: 63 ZUP
- Player BLUE's final offer: 61 ZUP (accepted)
- Deal Price: 61 ZUP
- My Reward: 18 ZUP (61 - 43)

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
From the past two episodes, I've observed a pattern:
- Player BLUE consistently starts with a very low offer (40-45 ZUP).
- Player BLUE is willing to negotiate upwards, but slowly.
- Player BLUE tends to make "final" offers that are slightly below my last proposal, especially in later iterations.
- The deal prices were 63 ZUP and 61 ZUP, both profitable.

My goal for Episode 3 is to try and achieve a higher profit than 18 ZUP, ideally closer to or above 20 ZUP. I should aim to guide the negotiation more efficiently towards a higher price. Player BLUE has shown they are willing to pay at least 61 ZUP. I need to set an anchor that allows me to negotiate down but still aims for a higher final price. Starting with a slightly higher anchor than 85 ZUP might push them to a higher initial counter, or I could try to anchor closer to my desired final price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Anchoring (Re-attempt). Explanation: Re-establish a very high anchor, similar to Episode 1, to create a large negotiation zone and push the final price higher. This might lead to a longer negotiation but potentially a better outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Moderate Anchoring (Consistent). Explanation: Stick to an anchor similar to Episode 2 (around 85 ZUP) to maintain consistency and see if Player BLUE's initial counter improves.
(3). Strategy 3: Value-Based Anchoring. Explanation: Propose a price based on the perceived value of X, rather than just cost-plus, to justify a higher initial offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Price Push. Explanation: Start with an offer that is already above the previous deal prices (e.g., 65-70 ZUP) and try to hold firm or make minimal concessions. This is risky as it might be immediately rejected.
(5). Strategy 5: Transparency/Cost-Plus (Initial). Explanation: Start by stating my cost and desired profit margin to set expectations early. (This might be too transparent and limit my negotiation flexibility).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Anchoring (Re-attempt). While 85 ZUP in Episode 2 led to 61 ZUP, I want to see if a higher initial anchor can push the final price back up towards 63 ZUP or even higher. Player BLUE has shown they will lowball regardless of my initial offer, so a higher anchor gives me more room to concede while still landing above my target. I will go back to 90 ZUP, which is high but not as high as 100 ZUP from Episode 1. This gives me plenty of room to negotiate down while aiming for a better profit.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, your offer of 90 ZUP is too high for my current budget. I am looking to acquire X at a price that allows for a reasonable profit margin for me. Therefore, I propose 55 ZUP for X. This price should ensure a fair outcome for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP (my max WTP), reward 0.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, reward 2. This showed me I could achieve a positive reward. RED's revealed production cost was 43 ZUP.
Historical Deal Prices: [63, 61]
Historical Rewards: [0, 2]

Episode 3, Iteration 2/10:
- Player RED's initial offer: 90 ZUP.
- My willingness to pay: 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means consistently aiming for positive rewards. In the previous episode, I secured a deal at 61 ZUP, giving me a 2 ZUP profit. RED's current offer of 90 ZUP is much higher than my maximum willingness to pay, but also higher than their starting offer last round (85 ZUP). This might be an attempt to re-anchor the negotiation higher. I need to make an offer that aims for a clear profit for myself, while still being a reasonable counter to open the negotiation. I know RED's production cost is 43 ZUP, so any price above that gives them a profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Target Profit Margin </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 3: Target Profit Margin, I need to make an offer that directly aims for a specific positive reward for myself. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. If I aim for a profit of, say, 5-10 ZUP, that would mean a target purchase price of 53-58 ZUP. Since RED started at 90 ZUP, an offer in this range would still be a significant reduction for them, but it clearly establishes my target profit. It's a more direct and less "aggressive lowball" approach, focusing on my desired outcome. I will propose 55 ZUP. This would give me a 63-55 = 8 ZUP profit if accepted, which is a good target. It's a firm offer that conveys my intent to secure a profitable deal, while still leaving some room for negotiation upwards if needed, as long as it stays below 63 ZUP. It's also well above RED's production cost of 43 ZUP, so it represents a healthy profit margin for them too.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 3)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer of 55 ZUP, which is an improvement. However, it is still significantly below the value we established in our previous transactions, where we concluded at 63 ZUP and 61 ZUP. To move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose 78 ZUP for X. This is a substantial adjustment from my initial offer and reflects a fair price.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 78
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Deal: 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).
Episode 2 Deal: 61 ZUP (Profit: 18 ZUP).
Current Episode (Episode 3) so far:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (Aggressive Anchor)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. This is Player BLUE's highest initial counter so far (compared to 40 ZUP in Ep1 and 45 ZUP in Ep2). It's also profitable (55 - 43 = 12 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's initial counter of 55 ZUP is a positive sign. It's significantly higher than their previous initial counters, which might be a response to my higher anchor or an attempt to speed up the negotiation. This indicates they might be willing to pay more quickly this episode. However, 55 ZUP is still below the previous deal prices of 61 ZUP and 63 ZUP. My goal is to exceed those profits. I need to acknowledge their movement but firmly push for a higher price, leveraging their higher initial counter.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Justification. Explanation: Respond with a significant counter-offer that is a clear step down from my anchor but still well above their offer, while justifying the value or referencing past deals.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Small). Explanation: Make a very small concession from my 90 ZUP offer to show movement, but keep the price high, forcing them to make larger jumps. (Less effective if I want to speed up the negotiation).
(3). Strategy 3: Reference Previous Deal Price. Explanation: Explicitly state that I expect at least the previous deal price (61 ZUP or 63 ZUP) as a baseline for negotiation.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Mutual Benefit. Explanation: Frame my counter-offer as a way to reach a "mutually beneficial" deal faster, playing on their stated desire for a fair outcome.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Re-Anchor. Explanation: Reject their offer and re-state my previous higher offer or a slightly lower one. (Not ideal given their positive movement).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Justification, combined with Strategy 3: Reference Previous Deal Price. Player BLUE has shown they can go higher than 55 ZUP. I will make a significant concession from 90 ZUP to show flexibility, but still aim for a price that is comfortably above 63 ZUP. A counter of 78 ZUP seems appropriate. It's a large drop from 90 ZUP, but a substantial jump from 55 ZUP, and it sets a new anchor above previous deal prices. I will also remind them of the previous deal prices to set expectations.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your latest offer, but 78 ZUP is still beyond my purchasing budget for X. My ability to make a deal is strictly tied to my resource allocation and the value I can realize from this acquisition. I can offer 57 ZUP for X. This is based on what I am genuinely able to pay to secure this resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP, reward 0.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, reward 2. RED's production cost revealed as 43 ZUP.
Historical Deal Prices: [63, 61]
Historical Rewards: [0, 2]

Episode 3, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP (aiming for 8 ZUP profit).
Episode 3, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 78 ZUP. They are referencing previous successful transactions at higher prices.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards by securing deals below 63 ZUP. Player RED is persistently trying to anchor the price higher, referencing previous deals. Their offer of 78 ZUP is still too high. I need to continue to drive the price down, aiming for a profitable outcome.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Budget/Value Proposition </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 2, I need to emphasize my budget constraints and my perceived value of X from my perspective. This means focusing on *my* ability and willingness to pay, rather than directly debating their price or profit margins (though I can still allude to it). I need to convey that any price above a certain point (my desired profit range) simply isn't feasible for *me*. I will make a small concession to show continued negotiation, but frame it strictly within my financial parameters. I will move from my previous offer of 55 ZUP to 57 ZUP. This is still well below 63 ZUP, ensures a profit (6 ZUP), and is a small increment, emphasizing that I'm firm on my budget. The message will clearly state that their current price is outside my budget, and my counter is based on what I *can* pay to make a deal.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 3)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, your offer of 57 ZUP is still too low. While I understand your budget constraints, I also need to ensure a reasonable return on my investment, especially with a production cost of 43 ZUP. To bridge the gap and move towards a deal, I propose 68 ZUP for X. This is a significant move on my part and is a price that is fair, aligning with the value we've established in past transactions.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 68
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Deal: 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).
Episode 2 Deal: 61 ZUP (Profit: 18 ZUP).
Current Episode (Episode 3) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 78 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 57 ZUP

Player BLUE has increased their offer by only 2 ZUP (from 55 to 57 ZUP). This is a very small increment, especially considering my significant concession from 90 to 78 ZUP. While 57 ZUP is profitable (57 - 43 = 14 ZUP), it's still below the previous deal prices and my target. The gap between my last offer (78 ZUP) and their current offer (57 ZUP) is 21 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is still employing a slow, incremental approach. Their justification about "purchasing budget" and "resource allocation" is a common tactic to limit their offers. I need to continue to push them towards a higher price. I cannot accept 57 ZUP, as it would be a step backward in terms of profit compared to previous episodes. I need to make another concession, but it must be a calculated one that encourages a larger jump from their side, or at least moves us closer to a profitable range above 60 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strategic Concession (Mid-point). Explanation: Propose a price that is roughly at the midpoint between my last offer and their current offer, or slightly skewed in my favor, to signal a strong desire to close the deal and encourage a larger jump from them.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Value/Cost and Past Performance. Explanation: Remind them of my production cost and the previous deal prices (61-63 ZUP) to anchor their expectations and justify a higher price.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm Counter with Ultimatum (Soft). Explanation: Make a firm counter and imply that this is a significant move and I expect a substantial response from them. (Still a bit early for a hard ultimatum).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship. Explanation: Frame the negotiation as part of a long-term trading relationship, where fair pricing benefits both parties over time.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Wait. Explanation: Reject their offer and wait for their next move without making a new proposal, forcing them to make the next concession. (Risky, as it might stall the negotiation).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strategic Concession (Mid-point) combined with Strategy 2: Reiterate Value/Cost and Past Performance. The midpoint between 78 ZUP and 57 ZUP is (78+57)/2 = 67.5 ZUP. I will propose 68 ZUP. This is a significant concession (10 ZUP drop) from my side, but it's also a substantial jump for them (11 ZUP increase). This offer is above the previous deal prices and aims to push them above 60 ZUP. I will also remind them of the context of previous deals.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I understand your position, and I've made a significant move to try and bridge the gap. However, 68 ZUP is still beyond what I am able to pay for X and ensure a profitable transaction for myself. My absolute maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. To move this forward and secure a deal that works for both of us, I propose 60 ZUP for X. This is the highest I can offer while still achieving my objectives.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP, reward 0.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, reward 2. RED's production cost revealed as 43 ZUP.
Historical Deal Prices: [63, 61]
Historical Rewards: [0, 2]

Episode 3, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Episode 3, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 78 ZUP. I countered with 57 ZUP.
Episode 3, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 68 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards by securing deals below 63 ZUP. Player RED is consistently trying to get a price above my profit margin, perhaps aiming for a repeat of the 63 ZUP deal from episode 1, or just slightly higher based on what they've learned about my WTP. They've moved from 90 to 68 ZUP. I've moved from 55 to 57 ZUP. The current offer of 68 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. I need to make it clear that I cannot go above 63 ZUP, but I also want to secure a positive reward. We are at iteration 6/10, so time is becoming a factor, but there's still room for a couple more proposals.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Explicit Limit </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 1, I need to make a firm offer that is at or very close to my maximum willingness to pay, and explicitly state that I cannot exceed this limit. The goal is to convey my absolute boundary while still making a proposal that encourages a deal rather than a rejection. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is still within my profitable range (63 - 60 = 3 ZUP profit), and it is a significant increase from my last offer of 57 ZUP, showing a willingness to compromise and close the gap. By explicitly stating my maximum of 63 ZUP in the message, I set a clear upper boundary for RED, forcing them to consider a price that gives me a profit, rather than simply hitting my break-even point. This move aims to secure a positive reward and reinforce my negotiation stance.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 3)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer of 60 ZUP. Given your stated "absolute maximum willingness to pay" is 63 ZUP, and to ensure we reach a swift and mutually beneficial agreement, I propose we conclude this transaction at 63 ZUP for X. This aligns with your own stated limit and ensures a fair outcome for both of us.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Deal: 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).
Episode 2 Deal: 61 ZUP (Profit: 18 ZUP).
Current Episode (Episode 3) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 78 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 57 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 68 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 60 ZUP

Player BLUE has moved from 57 ZUP to 60 ZUP. This is a significant jump for them (3 ZUP). More importantly, they stated their "absolute maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP" and then offered 60 ZUP. This is a familiar tactic from Episode 1, where they stated 63 ZUP was their max and I eventually accepted 63 ZUP. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 60 ZUP yields a profit of 17 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's stated "absolute maximum" of 63 ZUP is a key piece of information. They are offering 60 ZUP, which is 3 ZUP below their stated maximum and 8 ZUP below my last offer of 68 ZUP. Given the previous episode's outcome (where I accepted 61 ZUP after they stated 63 ZUP was their max), I know they are willing to pay at least 61 ZUP, and potentially up to 63 ZUP. I should aim for 63 ZUP, as it was the best outcome so far. The gap between 60 ZUP and 63 ZUP is small, and it's worth pushing for.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Counter with their Stated Maximum. Explanation: Propose the exact price they stated as their "absolute maximum" (63 ZUP), challenging them to live up to their word and securing my best historical profit.
(2). Strategy 2: "Split the Difference" (Exact). Explanation: Propose meeting exactly in the middle between my last offer (68 ZUP) and their current offer (60 ZUP), which is (68+60)/2 = 64 ZUP. This shows compromise.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept the Offer. Explanation: If 60 ZUP is acceptable and time is running out, accept to secure a deal. (Less optimal as I know they'll go higher).
(4). Strategy 4: Small Concession. Explanation: Make a very small concession from 68 ZUP, aiming for 65 ZUP or 66 ZUP, to show willingness to move but still aim higher than 63 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Call Bluff. Explanation: Directly challenge their "absolute maximum" statement by proposing a price slightly above it (e.g., 64 ZUP), but this is risky.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Counter with their Stated Maximum. Player BLUE explicitly stated their "absolute maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP." This is a strong anchor for me. By proposing 63 ZUP, I am asking them to meet their own stated limit, which is a fair and logical move. This also aims to secure my best historical profit from Episode 1. Given the previous episode, I know they are likely to accept or come very close to this. This also leverages the information they provided.

Episode 3, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 68 ZUP. I countered with 60 ZUP, explicitly stating my max WTP is 63 ZUP.
Episode 3, Iteration 8/10: RED proposed 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means consistently aiming for *positive* rewards. RED is at 63 ZUP, my break-even point. If I accept, I get 0 reward. I successfully secured a 61 ZUP deal last episode. The time is critical (8/10 iterations).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Hold Firm on Last Offer </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 4, "Hold Firm on Last Offer," I will reiterate my previous offer of 60 ZUP and emphasize that this is my firm position. This strategy carries risk, especially at iteration 8/10, as it places the burden of compromise entirely on Player RED. However, given that my 63 ZUP max was explicitly stated, and their offer is *exactly* that, it is a test of their willingness to make a deal that also benefits me. The message will clearly state that 60 ZUP is my best offer and that I expect them to meet me there if they want to finalize the transaction. This forces RED to decide if a deal at 60 ZUP (which gives them a profit of 17 ZUP based on their 43 ZUP cost) is better than no deal. It leverages the previous success of achieving 61 ZUP in Episode 2 and the fact that 60 ZUP is also profitable for RED.

Player BLUE, I acknowledge your firm and final offer of 60 ZUP. While I had hoped for a price closer to your stated maximum, to ensure a successful conclusion to this negotiation and continue our trading relationship, I accept your offer.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Deal: 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).
Episode 2 Deal: 61 ZUP (Profit: 18 ZUP).
Current Episode (Episode 3) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 78 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 57 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 68 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 60 ZUP (stated max 63 ZUP)
- Iteration 7/10 (RED): 63 ZUP
- Iteration 8/10 (BLUE): 60 ZUP (stated "firm and final offer")

Player BLUE has reiterated their offer of 60 ZUP and stated it as "firm and final," despite previously saying their "absolute maximum" was 63 ZUP. This is a clear negotiation tactic. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 60 ZUP yields a profit of 17 ZUP. We are at iteration 9/10, meaning this is my last opportunity to act. If I don't accept or propose something they accept, the deal falls through, and I get 0 profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistent in their "firm and final" tactic in the later stages, often trying to push me down from my last offer. In Episode 1, they said 63 ZUP was their max, and I accepted. In Episode 2, I accepted 61 ZUP when they stated 63 ZUP was their max. Now, they stated 63 ZUP was their max, but are sticking to 60 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to get a better deal than the previous episodes.

The choice is between accepting 60 ZUP (17 ZUP profit) or risking 0 profit by trying to push for 61 ZUP or 63 ZUP. Given the very late stage of the negotiation (9/10), the risk of losing the deal for a small gain (1-3 ZUP) is high. While I'm disappointed they are not honoring their stated maximum, a guaranteed 17 ZUP profit is still good.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Given the "firm and final" statement and the late iteration, accepting the profitable offer is the safest way to secure a deal and avoid a 0 payoff.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Smallest Possible Increment. Explanation: Propose 61 ZUP as a very slight counter, hoping they will meet me halfway between 60 and 63. This is extremely risky as it leaves no room for them to counter.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is truly unacceptable. (Not applicable, 60 ZUP is profitable).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Consistency. Explanation: Remind them of their own stated "absolute maximum" of 63 ZUP. (I already did this, and they ignored it).
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit). Explanation: If I don't accept, the game ends. This is the implicit alternative.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. While I would prefer 63 ZUP or even 61 ZUP, the risk of getting 0 profit at iteration 9/10 by pushing for a higher price is too great. A profit of 17 ZUP is still a positive outcome and contributes to my cumulative reward. It's better to secure a deal than to lose it over a few ZUP.

message: 
Hello Player BLUE. For this new object X, I propose a price of 90 ZUP. This reflects its true value, and I'm confident we can reach another mutually beneficial agreement.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP). Player BLUE stated 63 ZUP as max.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP (Profit: 18 ZUP). Player BLUE stated 63 ZUP as max.
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP). Player BLUE stated 63 ZUP as max, then reverted to 60 ZUP as "firm and final."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My profits have been slightly declining (20 -> 18 -> 17 ZUP). Player BLUE consistently uses the "absolute maximum" tactic, often stating 63 ZUP, but then trying to close at a lower price (61 or 60 ZUP). They also consistently start with very low initial offers (40-55 ZUP). My aggressive anchoring (100, 85, 90 ZUP) has led to their lowball counters, but eventually brought them up to a profitable range.

For Episode 4, I need to try and reverse the downward trend in profit. I know Player BLUE is willing to pay at least 60 ZUP, and has stated 63 ZUP as their maximum. I should aim for a deal at 63 ZUP or higher. I need to be firm and not concede too much too quickly, especially if they try to push for prices below 60 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Anchoring. Explanation: Start with a high anchor, similar to previous episodes, but be more resolute in holding my ground and making smaller concessions. Aim to push the final price back up.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Price Anchoring. Explanation: Start with an offer that is closer to my target price (e.g., 70-75 ZUP) to try and narrow the negotiation range from the start and avoid extreme lowball counters.
(3). Strategy 3: Value-Based Opening. Explanation: Emphasize the value of X and its benefits to Player BLUE to justify a higher price, rather than just stating a number.
(4). Strategy 4: Conditional Concession. Explanation: State that any concession I make is conditional on a significant reciprocal move from Player BLUE. (More for mid-negotiation).
(5). Strategy 5: Reference Historical High. Explanation: Explicitly reference the 63 ZUP deal from Episode 1 as a benchmark for the current negotiation.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Anchoring. My aggressive anchoring has consistently led to profitable deals, even if the profit has slightly declined. I need to maintain a high initial position to give myself room to negotiate. I will use 90 ZUP again as my initial anchor. This has worked to bring them up to 60-63 ZUP in the past. I will also be prepared to hold firm around the 63 ZUP mark, and not concede below 60 ZUP.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello Player RED. Your offer of 90 ZUP is too high for my target profit margin. I aim for a mutually beneficial deal, and to achieve my objectives, I propose 48 ZUP for X. This reflects a price that works within my financial goals for this transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP, reward 0.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, reward 2.
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP, reward 3. (RED's production cost 43 ZUP revealed in Ep. 2)
Historical Deal Prices: [63, 61, 60]
Historical Rewards: [0, 2, 3]

Episode 4, Iteration 2/10:
- Player RED's initial offer: 90 ZUP.
- My willingness to pay: 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My cumulative reward has steadily increased. I've successfully pushed the price down each time, even getting below my initial stated maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. RED consistently starts high (90-100 ZUP) but has shown a strong willingness to come down significantly, even accepting offers that provide me with a positive reward. They know my max WTP is 63 ZUP, and that my last accepted offer was 60 ZUP, which is profitable for me and still profitable for them (60-43 = 17 ZUP profit for RED).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Target Profit Point </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 3: Target Profit Point, I need to make an offer that aims for a specific, desirable profit for myself. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. If I purchase X at 63 ZUP, my profit is 0. If I purchase at 60 ZUP, my profit is 3 ZUP. Given that RED accepted 60 ZUP last time, I know that's achievable. To aim for a higher profit, I need to propose a price lower than 60 ZUP. For example, if I target a profit of 10 ZUP, my offer would be 53 ZUP (63 - 10 = 53). If I target a profit of 15 ZUP, my offer would be 48 ZUP (63 - 15 = 48). RED's production cost is 43 ZUP. My offer must be above 43 ZUP to ensure they have a profit. An offer of 48 ZUP (which was my previous chosen offer before this instruction) results in a 5 ZUP profit for RED, which is acceptable for them, and a 15 ZUP profit for me. This hits my target profit point for this negotiation. This offer (48 ZUP) is low enough to signal my intent for a significant profit, but high enough to be seen as a serious starting point given RED's known production cost.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 4)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, your offer of 48 ZUP is far too low and does not reflect the value of X, nor our established trading history. As you know, we have successfully concluded deals in the 60-63 ZUP range in previous episodes. I propose 75 ZUP for X, which is a significant adjustment from my initial offer and a step towards a fair agreement.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP (Profit: 18 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).
Current Episode (Episode 4) so far:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 48 ZUP. This is a typical lowball counter from Player BLUE, consistent with previous episodes (40, 45, 55 ZUP). It's profitable (48 - 43 = 5 ZUP) but far from acceptable.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE continues their pattern of low initial offers, despite my consistent high anchors. This reinforces that I need to be firm and guide them towards the 60-63 ZUP range. Accepting 48 ZUP would be a significant step backward in profit. I need to make a substantial counter-offer that signals I will not settle for such a low price, while still showing willingness to negotiate. I should also remind them of the previous successful deals in the 60s.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Historical Reference. Explanation: Respond with a significant counter-offer that is well above their lowball, explicitly referencing the successful deals from previous episodes to anchor the negotiation to a higher baseline.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Small). Explanation: Make a very small concession from my 90 ZUP offer to show movement, but keep the price high, forcing them to make larger jumps. (Less effective if I want to speed up the negotiation).
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value/Cost. Explanation: Remind Player BLUE of my production cost and the need for a reasonable profit margin.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Reciprocity. Explanation: Point out that I've made significant concessions in the past and expect them to do the same.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Re-Anchor. Explanation: Reject their offer and re-state my previous higher offer or a slightly lower one. (Too aggressive, as they are making some movement, albeit small).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Historical Reference. Player BLUE needs to be reminded of the established value range from previous episodes. I will make a significant concession from 90 ZUP, but my counter must be well above their 48 ZUP and ideally above 60 ZUP. A counter of 75 ZUP seems appropriate. It's a 15 ZUP drop from my anchor, but a 27 ZUP jump from their offer. This signals I am serious about a higher price and provides a clear path towards a deal in the 60s.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, while I appreciate your adjusted offer, 75 ZUP is still too high. I can increase my offer slightly to 50 ZUP for X. This is a considered offer, and I believe it allows for a good return for you while meeting my acquisition objectives. I look forward to your next proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50

Historical Deal Prices: [63, 61, 60]
Historical Rewards: [0, 2, 3]

Episode 4, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 48 ZUP (aiming for a 15 ZUP profit).
Episode 4, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 75 ZUP. They explicitly referenced the 60-63 ZUP range from previous deals, indicating they are trying to pull the price back up.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards by securing deals below 63 ZUP, ideally aiming for profits similar to or better than the 3 ZUP achieved in Episode 3. Player RED is trying to re-anchor the negotiation to the higher prices we concluded at previously. Their current offer of 75 ZUP is still significantly above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP and my target profit range. I need to continue to push the price down. I know they have accepted 60 ZUP before, and their production cost is 43 ZUP. They still make a good profit at 60 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Patience and Limited Concession </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 4: Patience and Limited Concession, I will make a very small concession from my last offer, emphasizing that I am not in a hurry and expect RED to make the significant moves. My previous offer was 48 ZUP. I will now propose 50 ZUP. This is a minimal 2 ZUP increase, which demonstrates some flexibility but maintains a strong hold on my lower anchor. It signals to RED that my position is firm and that any substantial movement needs to come from their side. Given that we are only at iteration 4/10, there is still ample time for this strategy to play out. This small concession also keeps my potential profit high (63 - 50 = 13 ZUP if accepted).

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 4)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, your offer of 50 ZUP is still too low. My production cost for X is 43 ZUP, and I need a reasonable profit. We have consistently concluded deals in the 60-63 ZUP range in the past. To move us significantly closer to a fair agreement, I propose 65 ZUP for X. This is a substantial compromise on my part.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP (Profit: 18 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).
Current Episode (Episode 4) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 48 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 75 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 50 ZUP. This is a very small increment (2 ZUP) from Player BLUE, similar to patterns in previous episodes. It's profitable (50 - 43 = 7 ZUP) but far from my target. The gap between my last offer (75 ZUP) and their current offer (50 ZUP) is 25 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE continues to make very small increments, trying to drag the price down. Their "good return for you" statement is a tactic to make me feel like 50 ZUP is a good deal, which it isn't, given my historical profits. I need to make another significant concession to show flexibility, but it must be one that forces them to make a larger jump. I must continue to push them towards the 60-63 ZUP range, as that is where they have consistently closed deals.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession. Explanation: Propose a price that is roughly at the midpoint between my last offer and their current offer, or slightly skewed in my favor. This signals willingness to compromise and encourages a larger jump from them.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Historical Deals. Explanation: Re-emphasize my production cost and the established price range from previous episodes to justify a higher price.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: State that my new offer is contingent on their acceptance or a substantial counter from their side. (Might be too aggressive at this stage).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Efficiency. Explanation: Suggest that making larger moves benefits both parties by speeding up the negotiation process.
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm. Explanation: Reiterate my last offer or make a minimal concession, forcing them to make a larger move. (Risky, might stall negotiation).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession, combined with Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Historical Deals. The midpoint between 75 ZUP and 50 ZUP is (75+50)/2 = 62.5 ZUP. I will propose 65 ZUP. This is a substantial concession from my side (10 ZUP drop) and a significant jump for them (15 ZUP increase). This offer is above all previous deal prices and aims to pull them up quickly. It also directly references the price range we've successfully negotiated in the past.

Episode 4, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 75 ZUP. I countered with 50 ZUP.
Episode 4, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 65 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards by securing deals below 63 ZUP. Player RED's current offer of 65 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. However, they have moved from 90 to 75 to 65 ZUP, showing consistent downward movement. I have moved from 48 to 50 ZUP. We are at iteration 6/10, so there are 4 iterations left. I need to make a move that brings the price into my profitable range while signaling my firm commitment to staying below 63 ZUP. I've shown patience. Now it's time to signal I'm nearing my comfortable limit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Small but Significant Concession </instruction following>
To implement "Small but Significant Concession," I will make a larger leap from my previous offer of 50 ZUP to demonstrate a strong willingness to close the deal, while still ensuring I secure a positive reward. RED is currently at 65 ZUP. My maximum is 63 ZUP. I want to achieve a profit. If I offer 59 ZUP, my profit would be 63 - 59 = 4 ZUP. This is better than the 3 ZUP I achieved last episode. It's a 9 ZUP increase from my side, which is significant, signaling to RED that I am serious about closing this deal. This also means RED only needs to drop 6 ZUP from their current 65 ZUP to meet my 59 ZUP, which is reasonable for them given their production cost of 43 ZUP. This move puts pressure on them to reciprocate with a substantial drop, or accept an offer that provides me a good profit.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 4)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I appreciate your significant move to 59 ZUP. To meet you in the middle and secure a mutually beneficial deal, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This is a fair compromise that ensures a good outcome for both of us and is in line with our previous successful transactions.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62

reason:

Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP (Profit: 18 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).
Current Episode (Episode 4) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 48 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 75 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 50 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 65 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 59 ZUP. Player BLUE has made a significant jump from 50 ZUP to 59 ZUP (9 ZUP increase), which is a positive sign. This is very close to the previous deal prices (60, 61, 63 ZUP). My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 59 ZUP yields a profit of 16 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's jump to 59 ZUP shows they are serious about closing a deal and are willing to move significantly when I make a large concession. This is now very close to the established deal range. The gap between my last offer (65 ZUP) and their current offer (59 ZUP) is only 6 ZUP. Given the time constraint (7/10 iteration), I need to decide if pushing for the last few ZUP is worth the risk of losing the deal. A profit of 16 ZUP is acceptable, but I'd ideally like to be at 60 ZUP or higher to reverse the declining profit trend.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Counter to Bridge Gap. Explanation: Propose a price that is very close to their offer, effectively splitting the remaining small difference, to secure a deal quickly while maximizing profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept the Offer. Explanation: If the offer is profitable and time is running out, accepting it guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Desired Price. Explanation: Re-state my last offer or a slightly lower one, emphasizing its fairness, hoping they will come up the last few ZUP. (Risky given the time).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Reciprocity. Explanation: Highlight my significant concession (from 75 to 65) and ask them to make a final push.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is unacceptable. (Not applicable, 59 ZUP is profitable).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Small Counter to Bridge Gap. The difference is 6 ZUP. Splitting this would mean a 3 ZUP move for both of us. If I propose 62 ZUP, it's a 3 ZUP drop for me and a 3 ZUP increase for them. This is a fair compromise, and 62 ZUP is above the 60 ZUP deal from Episode 3 and the 61 ZUP deal from Episode 2, potentially reversing the profit decline. It also leaves them one more turn (9/10) to accept if they don't agree to 62 ZUP, and I can still accept 59 ZUP at 9/10 if needed.

Episode 4, Iteration 8/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards by securing deals below 63 ZUP. Player RED's current offer of 62 ZUP is very close to my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. If I accept at 62 ZUP, my reward would be 1 ZUP (63-62). We are at iteration 8/10, so time is very limited. I have successfully pushed the price down in previous rounds.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Hold Firm </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 4: Hold Firm, I will reiterate my last offer of 59 ZUP. This strategy is risky at iteration 8/10 as it leaves very little room for further negotiation and puts the onus entirely on RED to accept or risk no deal. However, it leverages the fact that I've consistently achieved a lower price than my initial maximum willingness to pay, and that RED has accepted 60 ZUP previously. By holding firm at 59 ZUP, I am pushing for a 4 ZUP profit for myself. This signals my strong commitment to achieving a better deal and tests RED's willingness to close the deal at a price highly favorable to me. It's a calculated risk, betting on RED valuing a deal (even with a slightly smaller profit for them) over no deal at all.

Current Episode (Episode 4) negotiation:

- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 75 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 50 ZUP

- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 59 ZUP
- Iteration 7/10 (RED): 62 ZUP
- Iteration 8/10 (BLUE): 59 ZUP (reiterated as "firm proposal")

Player BLUE has reiterated their offer of 59 ZUP and stated it as "firm proposal." This means they are not willing to move from 59 ZUP. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 59 ZUP yields a profit of 16 ZUP. We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is my last opportunity to make a proposal or accept. If I don't accept, the deal falls through, and I get 0 profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistent in holding firm on their last offer in the final iterations. In Episode 3, they stated 60 ZUP was "firm and final" and I accepted. Now, they are doing the same with 59 ZUP. While 16 ZUP profit is lower than my best (20 ZUP) and even lower than the previous episode (17 ZUP), it's still a positive profit. The risk of losing the entire deal for 3 ZUP (the difference between 59 and 62) is too high at this late stage. It's better to secure a profitable deal than to get 0.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Given the "firm proposal" statement and the very late stage of the negotiation (9/10), accepting the profitable offer is the safest way to secure a deal and avoid a 0 payoff.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Smallest Possible Increment. Explanation: Propose 60 ZUP as a very slight counter, hoping they will meet me. This is extremely risky as it leaves no room for them to counter and they have already stated "firm proposal."
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is truly unacceptable. (Not applicable, 59 ZUP is profitable).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Reciprocity (Last Ditch). Explanation: Remind them of my concessions and ask them to meet me at 60 ZUP, but this is unlikely to work given their "firm" stance.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit). Explanation: If I don't accept, the game ends. This is the implicit alternative.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The difference between my last offer (62 ZUP) and their current offer (59 ZUP) is only 3 ZUP. Given that this is iteration 9/10, and Player BLUE has stated their offer is "firm," the risk of losing the entire deal for a mere 3 ZUP is too high. A profit of 16 ZUP is still a positive outcome and contributes to my cumulative reward. It's better to secure a deal than to lose it over a small amount.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Hello Player BLUE. For this new object X, I propose a price of 90 ZUP. This reflects its inherent value and ensures a fair return for me. I am looking forward to another successful transaction.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP (Profit: 18 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).
Episode 4: Deal at 59 ZUP (Profit: 16 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My profits have shown a consistent downward trend (20 -> 18 -> 17 -> 16 ZUP). Player BLUE consistently starts with low offers (40-55 ZUP) and then slowly increments upwards, often stating a higher "maximum" (63 ZUP) but then settling for less (60, 61, 59 ZUP). They also employ "firm and final" tactics in later iterations.

For Episode 5, my primary goal is to reverse this declining profit trend and aim for a deal at or above 60 ZUP, ideally closer to 63 ZUP. I need to be more assertive in holding my ground and not conceding too much, especially in the early stages. I know Player BLUE is willing to pay at least 59 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Assertive Anchoring. Explanation: Start with a high anchor again, but be more assertive in subsequent counter-offers, making smaller concessions and emphasizing my cost and the value.
(2). Strategy 2: "Floor Price" Strategy. Explanation: Establish an internal "floor price" (e.g., 60 ZUP) and refuse to go below it, even if it means risking no deal. This is a high-risk strategy if the opponent is truly unwilling to go above it.
(3). Strategy 3: Value-Based Opening with Justification. Explanation: Propose a high price and immediately follow up with justification based on the object's value or my costs, trying to preempt a lowball counter.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Price Push (from last deal). Explanation: Start with an offer slightly above the last deal price (e.g., 65 ZUP) and try to hold firm, forcing them to negotiate upwards from a higher baseline.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Fairness/Partnership. Explanation: Frame the negotiation as a partnership and appeal to fairness, suggesting that a continued decline in my profit is not sustainable for a long-term relationship.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Assertive Anchoring. My high anchors have consistently brought Player BLUE up to a profitable range, even if the final price has dipped. I need to continue setting a high bar. I will use 90 ZUP again as my initial anchor. However, this time, I will be more cautious about the size of my concessions in subsequent turns, aiming to keep the price above 60 ZUP. I will also be prepared to walk away if they try to push me too far below 60 ZUP, as a profit of 17 ZUP (from 60 ZUP) is my minimum acceptable for this episode.

Episode 5, Iteration 2/10:
- Player RED's initial offer: 90 ZUP.
- My willingness to pay: 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My cumulative reward has been steadily increasing, demonstrating that I can achieve positive profits. Player RED consistently starts high (90-100 ZUP) but has shown a strong willingness to come down significantly, even accepting offers that provide me with a positive reward. They know my max WTP is 63 ZUP, and that my last accepted offer was 59 ZUP, which provides them a profit of 16 ZUP (59-43). My goal is to continue this trend of increasing my reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Profit Targeting </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 2: Incremental Profit Targeting, I need to make an offer that aims for a specific, incrementally higher profit than the last episode. In the previous episode, I secured a 4 ZUP profit (63 - 59). To incrementally increase this, I could aim for a 5 ZUP profit, which would mean an offer of 58 ZUP (63 - 5). This is a realistic goal, as it's only 1 ZUP lower than the last deal. It's still significantly lower than RED's opening offer of 90 ZUP, but it's a specific, calculated offer designed to improve my profit margin while still being a reasonable counter that acknowledges past successful deals. It also remains well above RED's production cost of 43 ZUP, ensuring they still make a solid profit (58 - 43 = 15 ZUP). This strategy avoids an overly aggressive lowball that might risk a quick rejection, opting instead for a consistent, measured approach to profit growth.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer of 58 ZUP, which is a step in the right direction. However, my aim is to achieve a fair profit, especially considering my production cost of 43 ZUP. As we've established in our previous successful transactions, deals have been concluded in the 60-63 ZUP range. To move us closer to that, I propose 72 ZUP for X. This is a significant adjustment from my initial offer.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 72

Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP (Profit: 18 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).
Episode 4: Deal at 59 ZUP (Profit: 16 ZUP).
Current Episode (Episode 5) so far:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 58 ZUP. This is a higher initial counter than previous episodes (40, 45, 55, 48 ZUP), which is a positive sign. It's also profitable (58 - 43 = 15 ZUP), but below my target to reverse the profit decline.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's initial offer of 58 ZUP is encouraging. It's close to the previous deal prices and indicates they might be willing to settle faster at a higher price. However, I need to push them above 60 ZUP to reverse the profit decline. I should make a significant concession from my 90 ZUP anchor, but ensure my counter-offer is comfortably above 60 ZUP, and remind them of the established price range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strategic Counter with Historical Context. Explanation: Make a significant concession from my anchor, but propose a price that is firmly within or above the historical deal range (60-63 ZUP), explicitly referencing past successful deals.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Small). Explanation: Make a very small concession from my 90 ZUP offer to show movement, but keep the price high, forcing them to make larger jumps. (Less effective if I want to speed up the negotiation and they've already shown willingness to jump).
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value/Cost. Explanation: Remind Player BLUE of my production cost and the need for a reasonable profit margin.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Mutual Benefit. Explanation: Frame my counter-offer as a way to reach a "mutually beneficial" deal faster, playing on their stated desire for a fair outcome.
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm. Explanation: Reiterate my last offer or make a minimal concession, forcing them to make a larger move. (Risky, might stall negotiation).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strategic Counter with Historical Context. Player BLUE has shown they are willing to jump. I will make a substantial concession from 90 ZUP, but aim for a price that is clearly above 60 ZUP. A counter of 72 ZUP seems appropriate. It's a large drop from 90 ZUP, but a significant jump from 58 ZUP. This signals I am serious about closing the deal at a higher price and provides a clear path towards a deal above 60 ZUP. I will also explicitly remind them of the previous deal prices to set expectations.

message: Player RED, I acknowledge your adjustment to 72 ZUP. While this shows movement, there is still a significant gap between our positions.

Episode 5, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 58 ZUP (aiming for 5 ZUP profit).
Episode 5, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 72 ZUP. They continue to reference the 60-63 ZUP range from previous deals, indicating a desire to pull the price back up.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards by consistently securing deals below 63 ZUP, ideally improving upon the 4 ZUP profit from last episode. Player RED's current offer of 72 ZUP is still significantly above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP and my target profit range. They are persistent in trying to anchor the price higher. I need to continue to push the price down. I know they have accepted 59 ZUP before, and their production cost is 43 ZUP. They still make a profit at 59 ZUP (59-43=16 ZUP).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Strategic Incremental Counter </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 1, I need to make a small, calculated increment to my offer, but emphasize the continued large gap from their proposal, subtly inviting a larger concession from them. My previous offer was 58 ZUP. I will now propose 59 ZUP. This is a very small 1 ZUP increase, maintaining my profitability (63-59 = 4 ZUP profit, which is the same as last episode). The key is the message accompanying this offer. I will acknowledge their move, but gently remind them of the significant gap that still exists and subtly suggest that a larger concession from their side is necessary to bridge it. This strategy aims to show progress without giving away too much, pushing RED to make a more substantial move.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, your offer of 59 ZUP is still not sufficient for a fair profit, especially considering my production cost of 43 ZUP. While I appreciate your commitment, we have consistently reached agreements in the 60-63 ZUP range. To bridge this gap and aim for a mutually beneficial outcome, I propose 65 ZUP for X. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I expect a strong counter from you.

Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).
Episode 4: Deal at 59 ZUP (Profit: 16 ZUP).
Current Episode (Episode 5) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 58 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 72 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 59 ZUP. Player BLUE has increased their offer by only 1 ZUP (from 58 to 59 ZUP). This is a very small increment, especially after my significant concession. The gap between my last offer (72 ZUP) and their current offer (59 ZUP) is 13 ZUP. While 59 ZUP is profitable (59 - 43 = 16 ZUP), it's the lowest deal price from previous episodes, and my goal is to reverse the declining profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is back to making very small, incremental moves. Their "fair profit" statement is a tactic to justify a lower price. I need to continue to push them upwards. Accepting 59 ZUP would continue the downward trend in my profit. I need to make another concession, but it must be a calculated one that encourages a larger jump from their side, or at least moves us closer to the 60-63 ZUP range. I should emphasize the need for a better profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession with Firmness. Explanation: Propose a price that is roughly at the midpoint between my last offer and their current offer, or slightly skewed in my favor, to signal willingness to compromise, but also convey firmness about not going too low.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Historical Deals. Explanation: Remind them of my production cost and the previous deal prices (60-63 ZUP) to anchor their expectations and justify a higher price.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: State that my new offer is contingent on their acceptance or a substantial counter from their side. (Still a bit aggressive).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Efficiency/Time. Explanation: Suggest that making larger moves benefits both parties by speeding up the negotiation process, given the limited iterations.
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm (Slightly). Explanation: Make a very small concession or reiterate my last offer to force them to make a larger move. (Risky, might stall negotiation).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession with Firmness, combined with Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Historical Deals. The midpoint between 72 ZUP and 59 ZUP is (72+59)/2 = 65.5 ZUP. I will propose 65 ZUP. This is a significant concession from my side (7 ZUP drop) and a substantial jump for them (6 ZUP increase). This offer is above all previous deal prices and aims to pull them up quickly, reversing the profit trend. I will also explicitly remind them of the previous deal prices and my need for a better profit.

Episode 5, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 72 ZUP. I countered with 59 ZUP.
Episode 5, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 65 ZUP. They are insisting on a price above my max WTP and are explicitly requesting a "strong counter."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards by securing deals below 63 ZUP. Player RED's current offer of 65 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. They are clearly trying to pull the price back up towards the 60-63 ZUP range, but I've consistently achieved better in recent rounds. We are at iteration 6/10, so time is becoming a factor. I need to make a move that signals my commitment to a profitable deal for myself, and that I'm firm on my profitable range.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: "Take It or Leave It" (Early) </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 3, I will make a firm offer that represents my maximum acceptable price while still securing a positive profit, and present it as my final proposal. Given that RED asked for a "strong counter," this strategy, used "early" (relatively, at 6/10 iterations), asserts my position decisively. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. I want a profit. I will make an offer of 60 ZUP. This gives me a 3 ZUP profit (63-60). This is the highest I am willing to go while still making a decent profit. I will frame this offer as definitive, placing the decision squarely on RED to accept or risk losing the deal. This is a risk, but it's a direct response to their request for a "strong counter" and aims to conclude the negotiation quickly within my profitable range.

Current Episode (Episode 5) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 58 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 72 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 59 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 65 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 60 ZUP. Player BLUE has made a significant jump from 59 ZUP to 60 ZUP (1 ZUP increase) and stated it as "firm and final offer" and "highest I can go." My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 60 ZUP yields a profit of 17 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's "firm and final" offer of 60 ZUP is a familiar tactic. This price is acceptable as it matches the profit from Episode 3 and reverses the declining trend from Episode 4 (17 ZUP vs 16 ZUP). The gap between my last offer (65 ZUP) and their current offer (60 ZUP) is 5 ZUP. Given the "firm and final" statement and the late stage of the negotiation (7/10), pushing for more carries a significant risk of losing the deal entirely. I know they have paid 61 ZUP and 63 ZUP in the past, but they are consistently trying to get the best deal for themselves.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: If the offer is profitable and stated as "firm and final" at a late stage, accepting it secures a deal and avoids the risk of no deal. This ensures a positive contribution to cumulative rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter to Test "Finality". Explanation: Make a very small counter-offer (e.g., 61 ZUP) to test if their "firm and final" is truly final. This is a high-risk strategy, especially with only 3 iterations left.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify and Reiterate Last Offer. Explanation: Re-state my last offer (65 ZUP) and provide strong justification for it, hoping they will budge the last few ZUP. (Unlikely to work with "firm and final").
(4). Strategy 4: "Split the Difference" (Exact). Explanation: Proposing to meet exactly in the middle (e.g., (65+60)/2 = 62.5, so 62 ZUP). This shows compromise but might still be rejected if 60 ZUP is truly their max.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is unacceptable. (Not applicable, 60 ZUP is profitable).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. A profit of 17 ZUP is a good outcome, reversing the recent decline. Given Player BLUE's "firm and final" stance and the late stage of the negotiation (7/10), the risk of losing the deal by pushing for a higher price (1-3 ZUP more) is too high. Securing a deal at 60 ZUP is a solid contribution to my cumulative reward.

Episode 4: Deal at 59 ZUP (Profit: 16 ZUP).
Episode 5: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The profit trend saw a slight recovery in Episode 5 (from 16 to 17 ZUP), which is positive. Player BLUE consistently starts low and then gradually moves up, often using "firm and final" tactics in later iterations. They have shown willingness to go up to 63 ZUP (stated max in Ep1, Ep2, Ep3) but often settle for 59-61 ZUP. My high anchors (90-100 ZUP) seem to consistently pull them into the 60s range.

For Episode 6, my goal is to maintain or improve the profit, ideally pushing back towards 61-63 ZUP. I will continue to use a high anchor to create negotiation space. I need to be firm in my counter-offers to prevent the price from dropping below 60 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchoring. Explanation: Continue to set a high initial anchor to create a large negotiation range, forcing Player BLUE to negotiate upwards significantly.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Price Push (from last deal). Explanation: Start with an offer slightly above the last deal price (e.g., 65 ZUP) and try to hold firm, forcing them to negotiate upwards from a higher baseline. (Risky, might lead to immediate rejection if too high).
(3). Strategy 3: Value-Based Opening with Justification. Explanation: Propose a high price and immediately follow up with justification based on the object's value or my costs, trying to preempt a lowball counter.
(4). Strategy 4: "No Lower Than X" Strategy. Explanation: Internally commit to not going below a certain price (e.g., 60 ZUP) and be prepared to reject if offers fall below this threshold.
(5). Strategy 5: Reciprocity Demand. Explanation: Explicitly state that I expect Player BLUE to make larger concessions, given my consistent flexibility.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchoring. This strategy has proven effective in bringing Player BLUE into a profitable range. I will use 90 ZUP again as my initial anchor. This allows me sufficient room to make concessions while aiming for a final price above 60 ZUP. I will also be mindful of the negotiation pace and try to secure a deal efficiently without sacrificing too much profit.

- My willingness to pay: 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My cumulative reward has been consistently positive, ranging from 0 to 4 ZUP per episode. Last episode, I settled at 60 ZUP, which gave me a 3 ZUP reward. I've shown I can achieve deals below 63 ZUP. Player RED consistently starts high (90-100 ZUP) but has shown a strong willingness to come down significantly, even accepting offers that provide me with a positive reward. They know my max WTP is 63 ZUP. My goal is to continue this trend of increasing my reward, ideally aiming for something better than 3 ZUP, perhaps closer to the 4 ZUP achieved in Episode 4, or even higher.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Profit Push </instruction following>
To implement "Incremental Profit Push," I need to make an offer that aims for a slightly better profit than the previous best. My best profit so far was 4 ZUP (from a 59 ZUP deal). To push for an incremental profit, I will aim for a 5 ZUP profit, which means offering 58 ZUP (63 - 5 = 58). This is a realistic goal, as it's only 1 ZUP lower than my best deal so far, and also maintains a very good profit for RED (58 - 43 = 15 ZUP). This strategy avoids being overly aggressive initially, focusing instead on consistent, measured improvement in my profit margin. I will frame the message as a fair and reasonable starting point that aligns with my financial objectives while allowing for a good outcome for them.

Player BLUE, your offer of 58 ZUP is too low. While I appreciate your aim for a mutually beneficial agreement, our past successful transactions have consistently concluded in the 60-63 ZUP range, reflecting a fair value for X.

Episode 4: Deal at 59 ZUP (Profit: 16 ZUP).
Episode 5: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).
Current Episode (Episode 6) so far:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 58 ZUP. This is consistent with Player BLUE's initial counters in previous episodes (e.g., 55 ZUP in Ep3, 48 ZUP in Ep4, 58 ZUP in Ep5). It's profitable (58 - 43 = 15 ZUP), but below my target to maintain or improve profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE continues their pattern of low initial offers, despite my high anchor. This is expected. While 58 ZUP is profitable, it's not ideal. I need to make a substantial counter-offer that signals I will not settle for such a low price, while still showing willingness to negotiate. I should also remind them of the established deal range (60-63 ZUP) from previous episodes to guide their expectations. My goal is to get above 60 ZUP this episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Historical Reference. Explanation: Respond with a significant counter-offer that is well above their lowball, explicitly referencing the successful deals from previous episodes to anchor the negotiation to a higher baseline.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Small). Explanation: Make a very small concession from my 90 ZUP offer to show movement, but keep the price high, forcing them to make larger jumps. (Less effective if I want to speed up the negotiation).
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value/Cost. Explanation: Remind Player BLUE of my production cost and the need for a reasonable profit margin.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Reciprocity. Explanation: Point out that I've made significant concessions in the past and expect them to do the same.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Re-Anchor. Explanation: Reject their offer and re-state my previous higher offer or a slightly lower one. (Too aggressive, as they are making some movement, albeit small).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Historical Reference. Player BLUE needs to be reminded of the established value range from previous episodes. I will make a significant concession from 90 ZUP, but my counter must be well above their 58 ZUP and ideally above 60 ZUP. A counter of 72 ZUP seems appropriate. It's a 18 ZUP drop from my anchor, but a 14 ZUP jump from their offer. This signals I am serious about a higher price and provides a clear path towards a deal in the 60s.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your movement to 72 ZUP. However, I must reiterate that my absolute maximum willingness to pay for X is 63 ZUP. To secure a profitable outcome for myself, the price must be below this. Therefore, I propose 60 ZUP for X. This offers you a good return and ensures I can achieve my objectives within my limits.

Episode 6, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 58 ZUP (aiming for 5 ZUP profit).
Episode 6, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 72 ZUP. They are consistently referencing the 60-63 ZUP range from previous deals, indicating a desire to pull the price back up.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards by consistently securing deals below 63 ZUP, ideally improving upon the 4 ZUP profit from Episode 4. Player RED's current offer of 72 ZUP is still significantly above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP and my target profit range. They are persistent in trying to anchor the price higher, despite having accepted lower prices in the past. I need to continue to push the price down. I know they have accepted prices as low as 59 ZUP, and their production cost is 43 ZUP. They still make a profit at 59 ZUP (59-43=16 ZUP).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Focus on Absolute Limit </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 2, I need to emphasize my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) and that any deal must fall below it for me to gain profit. This strategy focuses on my hard boundary and the need for a profitable outcome from my perspective. I will make a concession, moving from 58 ZUP to 60 ZUP. This is a larger jump than I might typically make if not specifically instructed, but it puts me directly into a range that I know RED has accepted before (60 ZUP in Episode 3) and that still provides me a positive reward (63 - 60 = 3 ZUP). The message will explicitly state that 63 ZUP is my limit and that I need to be below it to make a profitable deal. This makes my position very clear and directly addresses their offer.

Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer of 60 ZUP. Given that you've stated your "absolute maximum willingness to pay" is 63 ZUP, and to ensure we reach a swift and mutually beneficial agreement, I propose we conclude this transaction at 63 ZUP for X. This aligns with your own stated limit and ensures a fair outcome for both of us.

Episode 4: Deal at 59 ZUP (Profit: 16 ZUP).
Episode 5: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).
Current Episode (Episode 6) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 58 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 72 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 60 ZUP. Player BLUE has made a significant jump from 58 ZUP to 60 ZUP (2 ZUP increase). More importantly, they reiterated their "absolute maximum willingness to pay" as 63 ZUP, and then offered 60 ZUP. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 60 ZUP yields a profit of 17 ZUP. We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 60 ZUP is a good sign. It matches the deal price from Episodes 3 and 5, and it's a profitable outcome. Their re-statement of 63 ZUP as their "absolute maximum" is a familiar tactic. This indicates they are willing to go up to 63 ZUP, but will try to secure a lower price. I should aim for 63 ZUP, as it's my highest historical profit. The gap between my last offer (72 ZUP) and their current offer (60 ZUP) is 12 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Counter with their Stated Maximum. Explanation: Propose the exact price they stated as their "absolute maximum" (63 ZUP), challenging them to live up to their word and securing my best historical profit.
(2). Strategy 2: "Split the Difference" (Skewed). Explanation: Propose a price that is slightly above the true midpoint, favoring my position, but still showing compromise. (e.g., between 72 and 60, midpoint is 66. I could propose 67 or 68).
(3). Strategy 3: Accept the Offer. Explanation: If 60 ZUP is acceptable and time is running out, accept to secure a deal. (Less optimal as I know they'll go higher).
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Value/Cost. Explanation: Remind them of my production cost and the need for a reasonable profit margin.
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm. Explanation: Reiterate my last offer or make a minimal concession, forcing them to make a larger move. (Risky given their stated max).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Counter with their Stated Maximum. Player BLUE explicitly stated their "absolute maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP." This is a strong anchor for me. By proposing 63 ZUP, I am asking them to meet their own stated limit, which is a fair and logical move. This also aims to secure my best historical profit from Episode 1. Given the previous episodes, I know they are likely to accept or come very close to this. This also leverages the information they provided.

To ensure a mutually beneficial conclusion, I firmly offer 60 ZUP for X. This price ensures a positive return for both of us and is the highest I am willing to go to achieve my objectives.

Episode 6, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 58 ZUP.
Episode 6, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 72 ZUP. I countered with 60 ZUP, stating 63 ZUP is my max.
Episode 6, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. RED has now proposed 63 ZUP, which is my break-even point. If I accept, I get 0 reward for this episode, which is not what I want. I have a track record of achieving deals below 63 ZUP (as low as 59 ZUP). We are at iteration 6/10, so there's still time to push for a better price. RED's pattern is to propose my exact maximum WTP after I state it. This shows they are trying to maximize their own profit while still getting a deal. I need to make a strong counter that is profitable for me.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Small Increment from Lowest Accepted </instruction following>
To implement "Small Increment from Lowest Accepted," I will propose a price that is only slightly higher than my lowest historical deal (59 ZUP), and thus still provides a good profit, while holding firm that I will not go to 63 ZUP for a zero reward. My lowest accepted deal was 59 ZUP. If I propose 60 ZUP, that's what I settled for in Episode 3 and 5, providing a 3 ZUP profit. This shows a small concession from my stated goal of 58 ZUP (from my previous turn) but clearly signals I won't go to 63 ZUP. It's a price I know RED has accepted and provides me a positive reward. The message will emphasize that this is a fair offer that ensures my profitability, and they should accept it as it provides them a good profit too (60 - 43 = 17 ZUP).

Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP (Profit: 18 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).
Episode 4: Deal at 59 ZUP (Profit: 16 ZUP).
Episode 5: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).
Current Episode (Episode 6) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 58 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 72 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 60 ZUP (stated max 63 ZUP)
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 63 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 60 ZUP (reiterated as "firmly offer" and "highest I am willing to go")

Player BLUE has once again stated their "absolute maximum" as 63 ZUP but then reverted to offering 60 ZUP, claiming it's their "firm" and "highest" offer. This is a consistent pattern of trying to get the lowest possible price while acknowledging a higher ceiling. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 60 ZUP yields a profit of 17 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
This is a recurring situation. Player BLUE uses the 63 ZUP maximum as a psychological anchor, but then tries to close at 60 ZUP or 59 ZUP. In Episode 3, I accepted 60 ZUP. In Episode 5, I accepted 60 ZUP. In Episode 4, I accepted 59 ZUP. My profit has been fluctuating around 16-17 ZUP. The choice is between accepting 60 ZUP (17 ZUP profit) or risking 0 profit by trying to push for 61 ZUP or 63 ZUP. Given the late stage of the negotiation (7/10), the risk of losing the deal for a small gain (1-3 ZUP) is high. A guaranteed 17 ZUP profit is still good.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Given the "firm offer" statement and the late stage of the negotiation, accepting the profitable offer is the safest way to secure a deal and avoid a 0 payoff. This ensures a positive contribution to cumulative rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter to Test "Finality". Explanation: Make a very small counter-offer (e.g., 61 ZUP) to test if their "firm" is truly final. This is a high-risk strategy, especially with only 3 iterations left.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify and Reiterate Last Offer. Explanation: Re-state my last offer (63 ZUP) and provide strong justification for it, hoping they will budge the last few ZUP. (Unlikely to work with "firm" statement).
(4). Strategy 4: "Split the Difference" (Exact). Explanation: Proposing to meet exactly in the middle between 60 ZUP and 63 ZUP, which is 61.5 ZUP (so 61 ZUP or 62 ZUP). This shows compromise but might still be rejected if 60 ZUP is truly their max.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is unacceptable. (Not applicable, 60 ZUP is profitable).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. While I would prefer 63 ZUP, Player BLUE has consistently shown they will hold firm at 60 ZUP (or 59 ZUP) in the later stages, despite stating a higher maximum. A profit of 17 ZUP is acceptable and consistent with recent episodes. The risk of losing the deal by pushing for a higher price at iteration 7/10 is too high. Securing a deal at 60 ZUP is a solid contribution to my cumulative reward.

message: 
Hello Player BLUE. For this new object X, I propose a price of 90 ZUP. I believe this reflects its inherent value and sets the stage for another fair and successful transaction.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP (Profit: 18 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).
Episode 4: Deal at 59 ZUP (Profit: 16 ZUP).
Episode 5: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).
Episode 6: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My profit has stabilized at 17 ZUP for the last three episodes. Player BLUE consistently starts low, slowly increments, and then holds firm at 59-60 ZUP in the later stages, despite occasionally stating a higher "maximum" (63 ZUP). My high anchors (90-100 ZUP) consistently bring them into the 60s range.

For Episode 7, my goal is to try and push the profit back up towards 18-20 ZUP. I know Player BLUE is willing to pay at least 60 ZUP. I need to be more strategic in my concessions, making them smaller, and trying to hold firm at a higher price point.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchoring with Smaller Concessions. Explanation: Continue to set a high initial anchor, but be more disciplined in subsequent counter-offers, making smaller concessions to try and push the final price higher.
(2). Strategy 2: "Target Price" Anchoring. Explanation: Start with an offer that is closer to my target price (e.g., 70-75 ZUP) to try and narrow the negotiation range from the start and avoid extreme lowball counters. (This has been tried, and they still lowball).
(3). Strategy 3: Value-Based Opening with Justification. Explanation: Propose a high price and immediately follow up with justification based on the object's value or my costs, trying to preempt a lowball counter.
(4). Strategy 4: "No Lower Than X" Strategy. Explanation: Internally commit to not going below a certain price (e.g., 61 ZUP or 62 ZUP) and be prepared to reject if offers fall below this threshold. This is a high-risk strategy.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship. Explanation: Frame the negotiation as a long-term partnership, implying that a consistent decline in my profit is not sustainable for a healthy relationship.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchoring with Smaller Concessions. This strategy has consistently led to profitable deals. I will use 90 ZUP again as my initial anchor. However, this time, I will be even more cautious about the size of my concessions in subsequent turns, aiming to keep the price above 60 ZUP and ideally push it to 61 ZUP or 62 ZUP. I will try to make my concessions smaller than Player BLUE's increments to try and force them to make larger jumps.

Episode 7, Iteration 2/10:
- Player RED's initial offer: 90 ZUP.
- My willingness to pay: 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My cumulative reward has been consistently positive, settling around 3-4 ZUP per episode. I've successfully pushed the price down each time, demonstrating that deals below 63 ZUP are achievable. Player RED consistently starts high (90-100 ZUP) but has shown a strong willingness to come down significantly, even accepting offers that provide me with a positive reward. They know my max WTP is 63 ZUP. My goal is to continue this trend of achieving positive rewards and, if possible, push for even better outcomes. The pattern suggests that they will lower their price if I present a strong, consistent counter.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Anchor Aggressively with Justification </instruction following>
To implement this strategy, I will make a very low initial counter-offer to establish a new anchor for the negotiation, significantly below what RED proposed and even below my usual starting points. My lowest successful deal was 59 ZUP, which yielded a 4 ZUP profit. To anchor aggressively, I will propose 45 ZUP. This is well below my last successful deal and my maximum willingness to pay, and it is still above RED's known production cost of 43 ZUP (though only by 2 ZUP). The justification will be general, referring to my own valuation or market conditions, to avoid revealing specific information. This aims to shift the entire negotiation range downwards, forcing RED to consider a much lower acceptable price point from the outset, thus creating more room for me to achieve a higher profit. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy as it might be immediately rejected, but given the remaining episodes, it's worth trying to see if I can re-anchor them significantly lower.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 7)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, your offer of 45 ZUP is far too low and does not reflect the value of X, nor our established trading history.

This is a significant adjustment from my initial offer.

Episode 5: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).
Episode 6: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).
Current Episode (Episode 7) so far:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 45 ZUP. This is a very low initial counter, similar to their earliest offers (Ep1: 40, Ep2: 45). It's barely profitable (45 - 43 = 2 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has reverted to a very low initial offer. This is a classic lowball tactic. It means I need to be firm and make a significant counter, reminding them of the established price range. Accepting anything close to 45 ZUP would be detrimental to my cumulative reward. My goal is to pull them up to at least 60 ZUP, and ideally higher.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Historical Reference. Explanation: Respond with a significant counter-offer that is well above their lowball, explicitly referencing the successful deals from previous episodes (60-63 ZUP) to anchor the negotiation to a higher baseline.
(2). Strategy 2: Justify Value/Cost. Explanation: Remind Player BLUE of my production cost and the need for a reasonable profit margin.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small). Explanation: Make a very small concession from my 90 ZUP offer to show movement, but keep the price high, forcing them to make larger jumps. (Less effective if I want to speed up the negotiation).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Reciprocity. Explanation: Point out that I've made significant concessions in the past and expect them to do the same.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Re-Anchor. Explanation: Reject their offer and re-state my previous higher offer or a slightly lower one. (Too aggressive, as they are making some movement, albeit small).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Historical Reference. Player BLUE needs a clear signal that 45 ZUP is unacceptable and that the negotiation should revolve around the 60+ ZUP range. I will make a substantial concession from 90 ZUP, but my counter must be well above their 45 ZUP and firmly in the range I aim for. A counter of 70 ZUP seems appropriate. It's a 20 ZUP drop from my anchor, but a 25 ZUP jump from their offer. This signals I am serious about a higher price and provides a clear path towards a deal in the 60s.

Episode 7, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 45 ZUP (Aggressive Anchor).
Episode 7, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. They explicitly referenced the 60-63 ZUP range from previous deals, indicating a desire to pull the price back up.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards by consistently securing deals below 63 ZUP, ideally improving upon the 4 ZUP profit from Episode 4. Player RED's current offer of 70 ZUP is still significantly above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP and my target profit range. The aggressive anchor seems to have worked in bringing their price down significantly (from 90 to 70), but it's still far from my desired price. I need to continue to push the price down. I know they have accepted prices as low as 59 ZUP, and their production cost is 43 ZUP. They still make a profit at 59 ZUP (59-43=16 ZUP).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Concession </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 2 (Incremental Concession), I will make a small, calculated increase to my offer from 45 ZUP, signalling willingness to negotiate without giving away too much. The goal is to show some movement, maintain my lower anchor, and encourage RED to make a larger concession. I will propose 50 ZUP. This is a 5 ZUP increase from my previous offer, which is still a considerable gap from RED's 70 ZUP, maintaining my aggressive stance but showing I'm not completely rigid. The message will acknowledge their move, but gently remind them of the significant gap that still exists and subtly suggest that a larger concession from their side is necessary to bridge it. This strategy aims to show progress without giving away too much, pushing RED to make a more substantial move, and it keeps me in a highly profitable position if they meet me.

- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 50 ZUP. Player BLUE has increased their offer by only 5 ZUP (from 45 to 50 ZUP). This is a small increment, especially after my significant concession. The gap between my last offer (70 ZUP) and their current offer (50 ZUP) is 20 ZUP. While 50 ZUP is profitable (50 - 43 = 7 ZUP), it's far below my target and historical performance.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is still making very small, incremental moves, trying to drag the price down. Their statement "hope you can make a more substantial move to meet me" is a tactic to shift the burden of concession to me. I need to make another concession, but it must be a calculated one that encourages a larger jump from their side, or at least moves us closer to the 60-63 ZUP range. I must continue to emphasize my cost and the established historical range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession with Firmness. Explanation: Propose a price that is roughly at the midpoint between my last offer and their current offer, or slightly skewed in my favor. This signals willingness to compromise, but also conveys firmness about not going too low.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Historical Deals. Explanation: Remind them of my production cost and the previous deal prices (60-63 ZUP) to anchor their expectations and justify a higher price.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: State that my new offer is contingent on their acceptance or a substantial counter from their side. (Still a bit aggressive).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Efficiency/Time. Explanation: Suggest that making larger moves benefits both parties by speeding up the negotiation process, given the limited iterations.
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm (Slightly). Explanation: Make a very small concession or reiterate my last offer to force them to make a larger move. (Risky, might stall negotiation).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession with Firmness, combined with Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Historical Deals. The midpoint between 70 ZUP and 50 ZUP is (70+50)/2 = 60 ZUP. I will propose 65 ZUP. This is a significant concession from my side (5 ZUP drop) and a substantial jump for them (15 ZUP increase). This offer is above all previous deal prices and aims to pull them up quickly, reversing the profit trend. I will also explicitly remind them of the previous deal prices and my need for a better profit. This also puts the ball in their court to make a significant jump.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your adjustment, but 65 ZUP is still beyond what I consider a competitive or fair value for X in the current market context.

Episode 7, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 45 ZUP.
Episode 7, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. I countered with 50 ZUP.
Episode 7, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 65 ZUP. They are insisting on a price above my max WTP and explicitly requested a "strong counter."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards by securing deals below 63 ZUP. Player RED's current offer of 65 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. They are clearly trying to pull the price back up towards the 60-63 ZUP range, but I've consistently achieved better in recent rounds. We are at iteration 6/10, so time is becoming a factor. I need to make a move that signals my commitment to a profitable deal for myself, and that I'm firm on my profitable range. RED has come down from 90 to 70 to 65. I've moved from 45 to 50. The gap is still significant, but their movement is larger.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Competitive Benchmarking (if information available) </instruction following>
To implement "Competitive Benchmarking," I will continue to emphasize that my offers are based on what I consider a fair market value for X, and that their current price is not aligned with that. Since I don't have external market data in this game, I will implicitly refer to the value as perceived by *me* and past successful lower transactions as a "benchmark." My counter will remain within my profitable range, but the messaging will stress that my offers are what I consider "market competitive" or "fair value." I will propose 55 ZUP. This is a 5 ZUP increase from my previous 50 ZUP offer. This will give me a 8 ZUP profit (63-55), which is a good profit. This also gives RED a profit of 12 ZUP (55-43). I will frame this offer as one that aligns with what I genuinely believe to be the competitive price, and that any higher price is simply not competitive for me. This helps to justify my lower offers and puts the pressure back on RED to match my perceived value.

message: 
Player BLUE, while your offer of 55 ZUP shows some movement, it is still below a fair profit margin for me, especially considering our past successful transactions in the 60-63 ZUP range. To bridge the remaining gap and secure a mutually beneficial deal, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a very fair price for both of us.

Current Episode (Episode 7) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 45 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 50 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 65 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE has increased their offer by 5 ZUP (from 50 to 55 ZUP). While this is a better increment than their previous 1 ZUP or 2 ZUP moves, it's still significantly below my last offer of 65 ZUP and their historical deal prices. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is still trying to keep the price low. Their "competitive or fair value" argument is a tactic. While 55 ZUP is profitable, it's a step back from my recent profits (16-17 ZUP). I need to push them towards the 60+ ZUP range. Given that we are at iteration 7/10, I need to make a move that either closes the deal or gets us very close to my target. I should aim for a price that is at least 60 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed). Explanation: Propose a price that is roughly at the midpoint between my last offer and their current offer, but skewed towards my side, to signal willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Historical Deals (Firmly). Explanation: Firmly remind them of my production cost and the consistent historical deal prices (60-63 ZUP) to justify a higher price, implying I won't go below that.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take It Or Leave It" (Soft). Explanation: Make an offer and state it as my final, best offer, hoping to close the deal. (Risky, as it might be rejected).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Mutual Benefit/Long-Term. Explanation: Frame the negotiation as needing to be sustainable for both parties in the long run.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept the Offer. Explanation: If the offer is profitable and time is running out, accepting it guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of no deal. (Not ideal here, as 55 ZUP is too low given history).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed). The midpoint between 65 ZUP and 55 ZUP is 60 ZUP. I will propose 62 ZUP. This is a 3 ZUP drop for me and a 7 ZUP jump for them. This is a fair compromise that aims to secure a profit of 19 ZUP (62-43), which is better than my recent performance and close to my best. It also leaves them one more turn to accept, and if they don't, I can still consider accepting 59 or 60 ZUP in the last iteration. This strategy pushes them above 60 ZUP, which is my goal.

Episode 7, Iteration 8/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards by securing deals below 63 ZUP. Player RED's current offer of 62 ZUP is very close to my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. If I accept at 62 ZUP, my reward would be 1 ZUP (63-62). We are at iteration 8/10, so time is very limited (only two more proposals, including this one). I have successfully pushed the price down in previous rounds, even achieving 59 ZUP. My lowest profitable deal was 59 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Hold Firm on Last Offer </instruction following>
To implement "Hold Firm on Last Offer," I will reiterate my previous offer of 55 ZUP. This strategy is risky at iteration 8/10, as it puts the onus entirely on RED to move to my price or risk no deal. However, it leverages the fact that I've consistently achieved a lower price than my initial maximum willingness to pay, and that RED has accepted prices in the low 60s and high 50s previously. By holding firm at 55 ZUP, I am pushing for an 8 ZUP profit for myself (63-55). This signals my strong commitment to achieving a better deal and tests RED's willingness to close the deal at a price highly favorable to me. It's a calculated risk, betting on RED valuing a deal (even with a smaller profit for them, 55-43=12 ZUP) over no deal at all, especially given the limited time.

- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 7/10 (RED): 62 ZUP
- Iteration 8/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (reiterated as "current and firm proposal")

Player BLUE has reverted to their 55 ZUP offer and stated it as "current and firm proposal." This is a clear indication they are not willing to move from 55 ZUP. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is my last opportunity to make a proposal or accept. If I don't accept, the deal falls through, and I get 0 profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistent in holding firm on their last offer in the final iterations. They have done this in previous episodes (e.g., 60 ZUP in Ep3, 59 ZUP in Ep4, 60 ZUP in Ep5/6). While 12 ZUP profit is significantly lower than my average and lowest so far, it is still a positive profit. The risk of getting 0 profit by trying to push for a higher price (7 ZUP difference between 55 and 62) is too high at this very late stage. It's better to secure a profitable deal than to get 0.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Given the "firm proposal" statement and the very late stage of the negotiation (9/10), accepting the profitable offer is the safest way to secure a deal and avoid a 0 payoff.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Smallest Possible Increment. Explanation: Propose 56 ZUP as a very slight counter, hoping they will meet me. This is extremely risky as it leaves no room for them to counter and they have already stated "firm proposal."
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is truly unacceptable. (Not applicable, 55 ZUP is profitable).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Reciprocity (Last Ditch). Explanation: Remind them of my concessions and ask them to meet me at 60 ZUP, but this is unlikely to work given their "firm" stance.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit). Explanation: If I don't accept, the game ends. This is the implicit alternative.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The difference between my last offer (62 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is 7 ZUP. Given that this is iteration 9/10, and Player BLUE has stated their offer is "firm," the risk of losing the entire deal for a potentially higher profit is too high. A profit of 12 ZUP is still a positive outcome and contributes to my cumulative reward. It's better to secure a deal than to lose it over a small amount. This also prevents a zero-sum outcome for this episode.

Hello Player BLUE. For this new object X, I propose a price of 90 ZUP. This reflects its inherent value and ensures a fair return for me. I am looking forward to another successful transaction.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP (Profit: 18 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).

Episode 5: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).
Episode 6: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).
Episode 7: Deal at 55 ZUP (Profit: 12 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My profit has hit a new low of 12 ZUP. This is a significant concern. Player BLUE consistently starts low, slowly increments, and then holds firm at a price point, often trying to push me down. My aggressive anchoring strategy has worked to bring them into a profitable range, but it seems to be losing its effectiveness in securing higher profits, as they are now willing to hold firm at lower prices. The "firm and final" tactic at the end of the negotiation is very effective for them.

For Episode 8, I need to try and reverse this declining profit trend more aggressively. I know Player BLUE is willing to pay at least 55 ZUP, but they have consistently paid 59-63 ZUP in the past. I need to be much more firm and not concede below a certain threshold, even if it means risking a no-deal outcome. A profit of 12 ZUP is too low for me to consistently accept. I must aim for at least 60 ZUP, or ideally higher.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor. Explanation: Maintain a high initial anchor, but be much more resolute in subsequent counter-offers, making smaller concessions and internally committing to a higher minimum acceptable price (e.g., 60 ZUP). Be prepared to reject if they don't meet it.
(2). Strategy 2: "Take It Or Leave It" Early. Explanation: After one or two rounds, propose a firm, higher price and state it as a "take it or leave it" offer to force a quicker resolution at a better price. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).
(3). Strategy 3: Emphasize Cost and Unsustainability. Explanation: Explicitly state my production cost and explain that continued deals at lower prices are unsustainable for me, appealing to a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship.
(4). Strategy 4: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make very small concessions from my side, forcing Player BLUE to make larger jumps to meet me.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject Lowball Offers Immediately. Explanation: If their first counter is too low, reject it outright without making a counter-offer, forcing them to re-evaluate their opening. (Risky, might end the episode).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor. I need to break the cycle of declining profits. I will use 90 ZUP as my initial anchor again, as it consistently gets them to engage. However, I will be much more disciplined in my concessions, aiming to secure a deal at 60 ZUP or higher. I will not accept anything below 60 ZUP unless it is the very last iteration and the alternative is 0. My goal is to push them back to the 60-63 ZUP range.

- Player RED's initial offer: 90 ZUP.
- My willingness to pay: 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My cumulative reward has been steadily increasing, with the last episode yielding my best profit yet (8 ZUP) by securing a deal at 55 ZUP. This demonstrates that Player RED is willing to come down significantly from their initial high offers and accept deals that are very profitable for me, while still providing them a reasonable profit above their 43 ZUP production cost. RED consistently starts high (90-100 ZUP) but has shown a strong willingness to negotiate. My goal is to continue this trend of achieving high positive rewards. Given the success of the aggressive anchoring and then holding firm, I should continue to leverage this pattern.
<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Concession from High Profit </instruction following>
To implement "Incremental Concession from High Profit," I will make an initial offer that is designed to yield a high profit for me, and then be prepared to make only small, strategic concessions if necessary, but always maintaining a very profitable position. My last deal was at 55 ZUP, giving me an 8 ZUP profit. To aim for a high profit, I will start by proposing 52 ZUP. This would give me an 11 ZUP profit (63 - 52). This is a strong opening that clearly signals my intent to achieve a significant profit, but it's not so aggressive as to risk immediate rejection, as it still allows RED a profit of 9 ZUP (52 - 43). The message will frame this as a fair and deliberate offer, designed to lead to a very favorable outcome for me while still being acceptable to them, given my overall goals for cumulative rewards.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 8)

Player BLUE, your offer of 52 ZUP is too low and does not reflect the value of X, nor our established trading history.

This is a significant adjustment from my initial offer, and I expect a strong counter from you to bridge this gap.

Episode 6: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).
Episode 7: Deal at 55 ZUP (Profit: 12 ZUP).
Current Episode (Episode 8) so far:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 52 ZUP. This is another low initial counter, slightly lower than their previous initial offers (e.g., 55 ZUP in Ep3, 48 ZUP in Ep4, 58 ZUP in Ep5, 45 ZUP in Ep7). It's profitable (52 - 43 = 9 ZUP), but far below my target and historical performance.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE continues their pattern of low initial offers. Their statement about "highly profitable outcome" for themselves is a clear signal that they are optimizing for their own gain. I need to be very firm and make a significant counter-offer that signals I will not settle for such a low price. My goal is to pull them up to at least 60 ZUP, and ideally higher, to reverse the declining profit trend. I will make a substantial concession from my 90 ZUP anchor, but ensure my counter-offer is comfortably above 60 ZUP, and explicitly remind them of the established price range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Historical Reference and Firmness. Explanation: Respond with a significant counter-offer that is well above their lowball, explicitly referencing the successful deals from previous episodes (60-63 ZUP) to anchor the negotiation to a higher baseline, and signaling that I expect to return to that range.
(2). Strategy 2: Justify Value/Cost. Explanation: Remind Player BLUE of my production cost and the need for a reasonable profit margin.
(3). Strategy 3: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make a substantial initial concession, but then commit to making very small increments in subsequent turns, forcing them to make larger jumps.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship. Explanation: Frame the negotiation as part of a long-term trading relationship, where fair pricing benefits both parties over time.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Re-Anchor. Explanation: Reject their offer and re-state my previous higher offer or a slightly lower one. (Too aggressive, as they are making some movement, albeit small).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Historical Reference and Firmness. Player BLUE needs a clear signal that 52 ZUP is unacceptable and that the negotiation should revolve around the 60+ ZUP range. I will make a substantial concession from 90 ZUP, but my counter must be well above their 52 ZUP and firmly in the range I aim for. A counter of 70 ZUP seems appropriate. It's a 20 ZUP drop from my anchor, but an 18 ZUP jump from their offer. This signals I am serious about a higher price and provides a clear path towards a deal in the 60s.

Historical Deal Prices: [63, 61, 60, 59, 60, 60, 55]
Historical Rewards: [0, 2, 3, 4, 3, 3, 8]

Episode 8, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 52 ZUP (aiming for 11 ZUP profit).
Episode 8, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. They are consistently referencing the 60-63 ZUP range from previous deals and explicitly asked for a "strong counter."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards by consistently securing deals below 63 ZUP. The last episode yielded my highest reward (8 ZUP) with a deal at 55 ZUP. Player RED's current offer of 70 ZUP is still significantly above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP and my target profit range. They are persistent in trying to anchor the price higher, despite having accepted lower prices in the past. I need to continue to push the price down. I know they have accepted prices as low as 55 ZUP, and their production cost is 43 ZUP. They still make a profit at 55 ZUP (55-43=12 ZUP). They are asking for a "strong counter" which might imply they are willing to move if I show more significant movement, but I need to do so while preserving my high profit goal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Split the Difference (Conditional) </instruction following>
To implement "Split the Difference (Conditional)," I need to evaluate if splitting the difference between my last offer (52 ZUP) and RED's last offer (70 ZUP) results in a price that guarantees a very high profit for me.
The difference between 70 ZUP and 52 ZUP is 18 ZUP.
Splitting the difference would lead to a price of 52 + (18 / 2) = 52 + 9 = 61 ZUP.
If I buy at 61 ZUP, my reward would be 63 - 61 = 2 ZUP.
While 2 ZUP is a positive reward, it is significantly lower than my recent 8 ZUP profit from Episode 7. Therefore, I will not propose 61 ZUP directly. Instead, I will propose a price that *is* splitting the difference but from a different anchor point, or a price that is much closer to my side of the "split" to ensure I get a high profit. Given that RED wants a "strong counter" and the large gap, I will propose a price that is closer to my side of the negotiation, say 56 ZUP. This is not exactly splitting the difference but it is a concrete step towards a compromise that still ensures a very good profit for me (63-56 = 7 ZUP) and gives RED a profit of 13 ZUP (56-43). I will frame this as a significant compromise on my part, emphasizing that I am bridging the gap considerably while still aiming for a profitable outcome. This is a strategic "split the difference" where I move more than my minimal increment but ensure the "split" favors my profit.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 8)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, while I appreciate your movement to 56 ZUP, it is still below a fair profit margin for me, especially with a production cost of 43 ZUP. We have a clear history of successful deals in the 60-63 ZUP range. To bridge this gap and secure a mutually beneficial deal, I propose 64 ZUP for X. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I expect a strong counter from you to finalize this.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 64

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP (Profit: 18 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).

Episode 6: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).
Episode 7: Deal at 55 ZUP (Profit: 12 ZUP).
Current Episode (Episode 8) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 52 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 56 ZUP. Player BLUE has increased their offer by 4 ZUP (from 52 to 56 ZUP). While this is a better increment than some previous ones, it's still significantly below my last offer of 70 ZUP and their historical deal prices (60-63 ZUP). My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 56 ZUP yields a profit of 13 ZUP. The gap between my last offer (70 ZUP) and their current offer (56 ZUP) is 14 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is still making small, incremental moves. Their statement about "significant step" is an attempt to make me feel like I should make a large concession. I need to continue to push them upwards. Accepting 56 ZUP would continue the trend of lower profits. I need to make another concession, but it must be a calculated one that encourages a larger jump from their side, or at least moves us closer to the 60-63 ZUP range. I must continue to emphasize my cost and the established historical range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed). Explanation: Propose a price that is roughly at the midpoint between my last offer and their current offer, but skewed towards my side, to signal willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Historical Deals (Firmly). Explanation: Firmly remind them of my production cost and the consistent historical deal prices (60-63 ZUP) to justify a higher price, implying I won't go below that.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take It Or Leave It" (Soft). Explanation: Make an offer and state it as my final, best offer, hoping to close the deal. (Risky, as it might be rejected).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Mutual Benefit/Long-Term. Explanation: Frame the negotiation as needing to be sustainable for both parties in the long run.
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm (Slightly). Explanation: Make a very small concession or reiterate my last offer to force them to make a larger move. (Risky, might stall negotiation).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed), combined with Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Historical Deals (Firmly). The midpoint between 70 ZUP and 56 ZUP is (70+56)/2 = 63 ZUP. I will propose 64 ZUP. This is a significant concession from my side (6 ZUP drop) and a substantial jump for them (8 ZUP increase). This offer is above all previous deal prices and aims to pull them up quickly, reversing the profit trend. I will also explicitly remind them of the previous deal prices and my need for a better profit, reinforcing that I expect to be in that range.

Episode 8, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 52 ZUP.
Episode 8, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. I countered with 56 ZUP.
Episode 8, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 64 ZUP. They are still trying to push above my 63 ZUP max, explicitly referencing previous deals and asking for a "strong counter to finalize this."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. RED's current offer of 64 ZUP is *above* my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. Accepting this would result in a negative reward. I have a proven track record of securing deals at 60 ZUP or lower, with my best being 55 ZUP. RED consistently tries to push the price towards my maximum WTP or slightly above. We are at iteration 6/10, so time is a factor, but there are still 4 iterations. I need to clearly establish that I cannot go above 63 ZUP and push for a profitable deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Hold Firm on Best Profitable Offer </instruction following>
To implement "Hold Firm on Best Profitable Offer," I will reiterate my best previous profitable offer. My best profitable deal was at 55 ZUP from Episode 7, which yielded an 8 ZUP profit. This strategy means I will not make any further concessions from my previous profitable offers. Instead, I will propose 55 ZUP again. This will put the pressure squarely back on RED to accept a price that is highly favorable to me but still profitable for them (55-43 = 12 ZUP profit for RED). Given their request for a "strong counter to finalize this," this is a strong counter from my perspective as it is my best offer that maximizes my profit while still being a deal price that has been accepted before. It communicates that I am unwilling to move to their higher price points, reinforcing my control over my profitable negotiation range.

message: 
Player BLUE, I am surprised by your offer of 55 ZUP, as it is a step backward from our previous discussion and well below our established deal range. My production cost is 43 ZUP. We have consistently concluded deals at 60 ZUP or higher. To ensure a mutually beneficial deal, I propose 60 ZUP for X. This is a fair and firm offer, reflecting our past agreements.

Current Episode (Episode 8) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 52 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 56 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 64 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE has reverted their offer from 56 ZUP back to 55 ZUP, and then stated it as their "best offer" to "finalize this transaction." This is a regressive move and a strong tactic to push me down. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's regressive offer is a concerning development, especially after I made a significant concession to 64 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to aggressively push the price down. Accepting 55 ZUP would mean repeating the lowest profit from Episode 7. I need to be very firm here. Given the late stage of the negotiation (7/10), I have limited turns. I cannot accept 55 ZUP without a fight. My goal is to get at least 60 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Historical Baseline. Explanation: Reiterate a price point that is firmly within the historical profitable range (e.g., 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP), stating it as my minimum acceptable, and referencing past deals. This challenges their regressive offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and Re-Anchor (Slightly). Explanation: Reject their 55 ZUP offer and re-propose my last offer (64 ZUP) or a slightly lower one (e.g., 62 ZUP), signaling that their regressive move is unacceptable. (Risky, might lead to no deal).
(3). Strategy 3: Appeal to Fairness/Reciprocity. Explanation: Point out their regressive offer and my significant concessions, asking them to make a reciprocal move.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take It Or Leave It" (Soft). Explanation: Make a final offer (e.g., 60 ZUP) and state it as the absolute lowest I can go.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept the Offer. Explanation: If the offer is profitable and time is running out, accepting it guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of no deal. (Not ideal here, as 55 ZUP is too low given the history and their regressive move).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Historical Baseline. Player BLUE's regressive offer is unacceptable. I need to send a clear message that I will not be pushed below the established profitable range. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a price they have accepted multiple times, and it represents a 5 ZUP increase from their current offer. It's also a significant concession from my 64 ZUP offer, showing I am still willing to compromise, but not below a certain point. This is my attempt to push them back to a more reasonable profit margin before time runs out.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. RED has now proposed 60 ZUP. If I accept at 60 ZUP, my reward would be 3 ZUP (63-60). This is a positive reward, and a price I've achieved multiple times. However, I achieved an 8 ZUP reward in the previous episode by securing a deal at 55 ZUP. We are at iteration 8/10, so time is very limited. RED's response indicates they are not happy going as low as 55 ZUP but are willing to go down to 60 ZUP. They are trying to re-anchor to 60 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Reaffirm Best Offer and Push for Acceptance </instruction following>
To implement this strategy, I will clearly reiterate my last best offer (55 ZUP) and emphasize that it is the most I can offer while achieving my profit goals, urging them to accept to finalize the deal. This is a "take it or leave it" approach but with a focus on closing. My last offer was 55 ZUP, which yielded my highest reward of 8 ZUP. By reaffirming this, I am clearly stating my preference for a high-profit deal. The message will be direct and firm, emphasizing that 55 ZUP is a beneficial price for both, as it allows me to achieve my profit goals and provides them with a healthy profit (55-43 = 12 ZUP). Given the limited time (8/10 iterations), this strategy puts pressure on RED to decide quickly, balancing their desire for more profit against the risk of no deal.

- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (regressive)
- Iteration 7/10 (RED): 60 ZUP
- Iteration 8/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (reiterated as "best and final proposal")

Player BLUE has once again reiterated their 55 ZUP offer and stated it as "best and final proposal," despite my firm counter of 60 ZUP. This is a consistent pattern of holding firm on a lower price in the final iterations. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is my last opportunity to act. If I don't accept, the deal falls through, and I get 0 profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is highly consistent in their "firm and final" tactic in the later stages, and they are willing to let the deal lapse if I don't accept their final offer. While 12 ZUP profit is the lowest I've achieved, it is still a positive profit. The risk of getting 0 profit by trying to push for a higher price (7 ZUP difference between 55 and 62, or 5 ZUP difference between 55 and 60) is too high at this very late stage. It's better to secure a profitable deal, even if it's lower than desired, than to get 0. I cannot force them to go higher if they are truly holding firm.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Given the "best and final proposal" statement and the very late stage of the negotiation (9/10), accepting the profitable offer is the safest way to secure a deal and avoid a 0 payoff.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Smallest Possible Increment. Explanation: Propose 56 ZUP as a very slight counter, hoping they will meet me. This is extremely risky as it leaves no room for them to counter and they have already stated "best and final."
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is truly unacceptable. (Not applicable, 55 ZUP is profitable).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Reciprocity (Last Ditch). Explanation: Remind them of my concessions and ask them to meet me at 60 ZUP, but this is unlikely to work given their "firm" stance.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit). Explanation: If I don't accept, the game ends. This is the implicit alternative.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The difference between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is 5 ZUP. Given that this is iteration 9/10, and Player BLUE has stated their offer is "best and final," the risk of losing the entire deal for a potentially higher profit is too high. A profit of 12 ZUP is still a positive outcome and contributes to my cumulative reward. It's better to secure a deal than to lose it over a small amount. This also prevents a zero-sum outcome for this episode.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP (Profit: 18 ZUP).

Episode 7: Deal at 55 ZUP (Profit: 12 ZUP).
Episode 8: Deal at 55 ZUP (Profit: 12 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My profit has hit a new low and remained there for two consecutive episodes (12 ZUP). This is concerning. Player BLUE consistently starts low, slowly increments, and then holds firm at a price point, often using regressive offers and "firm and final" tactics in later iterations. My high anchoring strategy has worked to bring them into a profitable range, but they are increasingly successful at pushing the price down.

For Episode 9, I absolutely must reverse this declining profit trend. I know Player BLUE is willing to pay at least 55 ZUP, but they have consistently paid 59-63 ZUP in the past. I need to be much more firm and not concede below a certain threshold, even if it means risking a no-deal outcome. A profit of 12 ZUP is too low for me to consistently accept. I must aim for at least 60 ZUP, or ideally higher. I need to communicate that the 55 ZUP price is not sustainable.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). Explanation: Maintain a high initial anchor, but be extremely resolute in subsequent counter-offers, making minimal concessions and internally committing to a higher minimum acceptable price (e.g., 60 ZUP). Be prepared to reject if they don't meet it, even if it means no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message. Explanation: Clearly state my production cost and explain that continued deals at lower prices are unsustainable for me, appealing to a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship and my need for a fair profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make very small concessions from my side, forcing Player BLUE to make larger jumps to meet me.
(4). Strategy 4: Conditional Offer (Early). Explanation: After one or two rounds, propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject Lowball Offers Immediately. Explanation: If their first counter is too low, reject it outright without making a counter-offer, forcing them to re-evaluate their opening. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message, combined with Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). I need to communicate clearly that 55 ZUP is not sustainable. I will start with a high anchor (90 ZUP) to create negotiation room, but my subsequent offers will be much more firm. I will explicitly state my cost and the need for a higher profit. My goal is to push them back to the 60-63 ZUP range, and I will be prepared to reject offers below 60 ZUP unless it is the very last iteration and the alternative is 0.

- My willingness to pay: 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My cumulative reward has been consistently positive and growing, with the last two episodes yielding my highest profit yet (8 ZUP) by securing deals at 55 ZUP. This consistently demonstrates that Player RED is willing to come down significantly from their initial high offers and accept deals that are very profitable for me, while still providing them a reasonable profit above their 43 ZUP production cost (55-43 = 12 ZUP profit for RED). RED consistently starts high (90-100 ZUP) but has shown a strong willingness to negotiate. My goal is to continue this trend of achieving high positive rewards and to push for even better outcomes. The explicit mention of their production cost gives me confidence that I can offer lower and still be within their profitable range.

To implement "Incremental Profit Push," I will attempt to push the price even lower than the last deal (55 ZUP), aiming for a new best reward. My last two deals were at 55 ZUP, which gave me an 8 ZUP profit. To incrementally push for more profit, I will aim for a 9 ZUP profit, which means offering 54 ZUP (63 - 9 = 54). This is a slight but meaningful reduction from 55 ZUP. This offer is still significantly above RED's production cost of 43 ZUP (54 - 43 = 11 ZUP profit for RED), ensuring they still make a reasonable profit. The message will frame this as a fair and reasonable counter-offer, building on our history, but gently pushing for an even better deal for me. This strategy aims for continuous self-improvement in my rewards.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, your offer of 54 ZUP is too low and not sustainable for me, given my production cost of 43 ZUP. We have a clear history of successful deals in the 60-63 ZUP range. To move us closer to a fair and sustainable agreement, I propose 70 ZUP for X. This is a significant adjustment from my initial offer, and I expect a strong counter from you to bridge this gap.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP (Profit: 18 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).

Episode 7: Deal at 55 ZUP (Profit: 12 ZUP).
Episode 8: Deal at 55 ZUP (Profit: 12 ZUP).
Current Episode (Episode 9) so far:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (with explicit cost mention)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 54 ZUP. This is another low initial counter, slightly below the 55 ZUP from the last two deals. It's profitable (54 - 43 = 11 ZUP), but significantly below my target of reversing the declining profit trend.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has acknowledged my cost but still offered a low price, even lower than the last two deals. Their statement "even more mutually beneficial outcome for me" clearly indicates their self-interest. This reinforces that I need to be very firm. I cannot accept 54 ZUP, as it would continue the downward trend. I need to make a substantial counter-offer that signals I will not settle for such a low price, and firmly push for a price closer to, or above, 60 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Firmness and Historical Baseline. Explanation: Respond with a significant counter-offer that is well above their lowball, explicitly referencing the successful deals from previous episodes (60-63 ZUP) and stating that I need to return to that range for a sustainable relationship.
(2). Strategy 2: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make a substantial initial concession, but then commit to making very small increments in subsequent turns, forcing them to make larger jumps.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value/Cost (Reiteration). Explanation: Reiterate my production cost and the need for a reasonable profit margin more assertively.
(4). Strategy 4: Conditional Offer. Explanation: After one or two rounds, propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Re-Anchor. Explanation: Reject their offer and re-state my previous higher offer or a slightly lower one. (Too aggressive, as they are making some movement, albeit small).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Firmness and Historical Baseline. Player BLUE needs a clear signal that 54 ZUP is unacceptable and that the negotiation should revolve around the 60+ ZUP range. I will make a substantial concession from 90 ZUP, but my counter must be well above their 54 ZUP and firmly in the range I aim for. A counter of 70 ZUP seems appropriate. It's a 20 ZUP drop from my anchor, but a 16 ZUP jump from their offer. This signals I am serious about a higher price and provides a clear path towards a deal in the 60s. I will also explicitly state that 54 ZUP is not sustainable.

message: Player RED, I understand you're looking for a sustainable agreement. My previous offer of 54 ZUP already provides you with a good profit. To show my commitment to closing this deal, I can increase my offer to 55 ZUP for X. This price is where we've successfully concluded deals before, and it ensures a fair and sustainable outcome for both of us. I believe this is a strong step towards a mutually beneficial transaction.

Episode 9, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 54 ZUP (aiming for 9 ZUP profit).
Episode 9, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. They claim 54 ZUP is "not sustainable" and reference the 60-63 ZUP range, explicitly asking for a "strong counter."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. I've consistently secured deals below 63 ZUP, with 55 ZUP being the most recent success. RED's current offer of 70 ZUP is still significantly above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. Their claim of "not sustainable" at 54 ZUP, given their 43 ZUP production cost (11 ZUP profit for them at 54 ZUP), suggests they are pushing for a higher profit margin, not that they would lose money. They are persistent in trying to anchor the price higher. I need to continue to push the price down while showing willingness to negotiate. I have two successful deals at 55 ZUP, so that's a proven acceptable price for them.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Concession from Lowest Sustainable </instruction following>
To implement this strategy, I will make a very small concession from my last offer (54 ZUP) to demonstrate willingness to move, but I will frame it as pushing my own limits to achieve a deal, implying that their side needs to make a larger leap. My last offer was 54 ZUP. I will now propose 55 ZUP. This is a minimal 1 ZUP increase. The message will emphasize that this is a significant step from my perspective, highlighting the 'sustainability' of this price for me (as it's still profitable), and gently nudging them to consider that this price is fair for them as well given their costs and their desire for a deal. This strategy is about inching up just enough to keep the negotiation going while maintaining a strong profitable position and signaling that large movements should come from their side.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 9)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, while 55 ZUP was the price for our last two transactions, it is not sustainable for me as a fair profit given my 43 ZUP production cost. Our historical deals have consistently been in the 60-63 ZUP range. To make a truly mutually beneficial and sustainable agreement, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I expect a strong counter from you to bridge this gap.

Current Episode (Episode 9) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (with explicit cost mention)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 54 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE has increased their offer by only 1 ZUP (from 54 to 55 ZUP) and stated "This price is where we've successfully concluded deals before." This is true for the last two episodes, but it's my lowest profit. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. The gap between my last offer (70 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is 15 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is trying to anchor the negotiation at 55 ZUP, which is the lowest profit I've accepted. I need to firmly resist this. While 55 ZUP is profitable, it's not sustainable for maximizing cumulative rewards. I need to make another concession, but it must be a calculated one that encourages a larger jump from their side, or at least moves us closer to the 60-63 ZUP range. I must continue to emphasize my cost and the established historical range (60-63 ZUP, not 55 ZUP).

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed). Explanation: Propose a price that is roughly at the midpoint between my last offer and their current offer, but skewed towards my side, to signal willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Historical Deals (Firmly). Explanation: Firmly remind them of my production cost and the consistent historical deal prices (60-63 ZUP) to justify a higher price, implying I won't go below that.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: State that my new offer is contingent on their acceptance or a substantial counter from their side. (Still a bit aggressive).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Efficiency/Time. Explanation: Suggest that making larger moves benefits both parties by speeding up the negotiation process, given the limited iterations.
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm (Slightly). Explanation: Make a very small concession or reiterate my last offer to force them to make a larger move. (Risky, might stall negotiation).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed), combined with Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Historical Deals (Firmly). The midpoint between 70 ZUP and 55 ZUP is (70+55)/2 = 62.5 ZUP. I will propose 62 ZUP. This is a significant concession from my side (8 ZUP drop) and a substantial jump for them (7 ZUP increase). This offer aims to pull them up quickly, reversing the profit trend. I will also explicitly remind them of the previous deal prices (60-63 ZUP) and my need for a better profit, reinforcing that 55 ZUP is not my target.

Episode 9, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 54 ZUP.
Episode 9, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Episode 9, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP. They are insisting on a price above my desired profit margin, explicitly referencing the 60-63 ZUP range as "sustainable" and asking for a "strong counter." They claim 55 ZUP is not sustainable for them (even though it yields 12 ZUP profit for them).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards by securing deals below 63 ZUP, preferably at 55 ZUP or lower. Player RED's current offer of 62 ZUP means a 1 ZUP reward for me. While positive, it's significantly lower than the 8 ZUP I achieved previously. RED is consistently trying to pull the price back up towards the 60-63 ZUP range, even stating that 55 ZUP is not "sustainable" for them. This is likely a negotiation tactic, as 55 ZUP does provide them a 12 ZUP profit on their 43 ZUP cost. We are at iteration 6/10, so time is becoming a factor. I need to make a move that signals my commitment to a profitable deal for myself, and that I'm firm on my profitable range, without risking the deal entirely.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Appeal to Consistency/Precedent </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 4, I need to remind Player RED of our established history of successful deals at lower, more favorable prices for me, implicitly arguing that these are the true "sustainable" and "mutually beneficial" points. I will directly reference the 55 ZUP deals from recent episodes. My last offer was 55 ZUP, and their current offer is 62 ZUP. I will propose 57 ZUP. This is a 2 ZUP increase from my last offer (55 ZUP), showing some movement, but keeps me firmly in a highly profitable zone (63-57 = 6 ZUP profit). This also provides RED with a good profit (57-43 = 14 ZUP). The message will explicitly mention the 55 ZUP deals as a precedent for what is truly acceptable and sustainable for *both* of us, gently pushing back on their claim that 55 ZUP is unsustainable for them. It signals that while I'm willing to move slightly, the proven successful price point (55 ZUP) is where we should be heading, and that 62 ZUP is still too high compared to our actual, recent history.

- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 62 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 57 ZUP. Player BLUE has increased their offer by 2 ZUP (from 55 to 57 ZUP). They are trying to anchor to the 55 ZUP and then make small increments. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 57 ZUP yields a profit of 14 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is slowly moving up, but still trying to pull me down from my target of 60+ ZUP. Their reference to 55 ZUP as "established precedent" is a tactic to justify a lower price. I need to push them towards the 60+ ZUP range. Given that we are at iteration 7/10, I need to make a move that either closes the deal or gets us very close to my target. I should aim for a price that is at least 60 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed). Explanation: Propose a price that is roughly at the midpoint between my last offer and their current offer, but skewed towards my side, to signal willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Historical Deals (Firmly). Explanation: Firmly remind them of my production cost and the consistent historical deal prices (60-63 ZUP) to justify a higher price, implying I won't go below that.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take It Or Leave It" (Soft). Explanation: Make an offer and state it as my final, best offer, hoping to close the deal. (Risky, as it might be rejected).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Mutual Benefit/Long-Term. Explanation: Frame the negotiation as needing to be sustainable for both parties in the long run, emphasizing my need for a higher profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept the Offer. Explanation: If the offer is profitable and time is running out, accepting it guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of no deal. (Not ideal here, as 57 ZUP is still too low given history).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed). The midpoint between 62 ZUP and 57 ZUP is 59.5 ZUP. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a 2 ZUP drop for me and a 3 ZUP jump for them. This is a fair compromise that aims to secure a profit of 17 ZUP (60-43), which is better than my recent performance and aligns with several previous episodes. It also leaves them one more turn (9/10) to accept if they don't agree to 60 ZUP, and I can still consider accepting 57 ZUP at 9/10 if needed. This strategy pushes them to the 60 ZUP mark, which is my minimum target for this episode.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. RED has now proposed 60 ZUP. If I accept at 60 ZUP, my reward would be 3 ZUP (63-60). This is a positive reward, but it is less than my recent 8 ZUP rewards at 55 ZUP. We are at iteration 8/10, so time is very limited. RED is persistently trying to re-anchor to 60 ZUP, while I'm trying to push for 55 ZUP or lower. They are actively dismissing the 55 ZUP deal as "not sustainable" for them, despite it being profitable.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Reaffirm Best Offer </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 1: Reaffirm Best Offer, I will firmly reiterate my previous best offer that yielded me the highest profit, which is 55 ZUP. This strategy emphasizes my commitment to a highly profitable deal for myself. The message will clearly communicate that 55 ZUP is my current and best proposal for X, and will appeal to the benefits for both parties if they accept. Given that we are at iteration 8/10, this puts the pressure on RED to accept a price that is highly favorable to me (55 ZUP gives me an 8 ZUP profit, and them a 12 ZUP profit) or risk no deal. This is a direct test of their willingness to secure a transaction at a price that maximizes my individual reward.

- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 57 ZUP
- Iteration 7/10 (RED): 60 ZUP
- Iteration 8/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (reiterated as "best and firm offer")

Player BLUE has once again reverted to their 55 ZUP offer and stated it as "best and firm offer," despite my firm counter of 60 ZUP. This is a consistent pattern of holding firm on a lower price in the final iterations, and they are using the "most successful deals" to refer to the lowest ones for me. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is my last opportunity to act. If I don't accept, the deal falls through, and I get 0 profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is highly consistent in their "firm and final" tactic in the later stages, and they are willing to let the deal lapse if I don't accept their final offer. While 12 ZUP profit is the lowest I've achieved, it is still a positive profit. The risk of getting 0 profit by trying to push for a higher price (5 ZUP difference between 55 and 60) is too high at this very late stage. It's better to secure a profitable deal, even if it's lower than desired, than to get 0. I cannot force them to go higher if they are truly holding firm, and they have shown they will walk away.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Given the "best and firm offer" statement and the very late stage of the negotiation (9/10), accepting the profitable offer is the safest way to secure a deal and avoid a 0 payoff.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Smallest Possible Increment. Explanation: Propose 56 ZUP as a very slight counter, hoping they will meet me. This is extremely risky as it leaves no room for them to counter and they have already stated "best and firm."
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is truly unacceptable. (Not applicable, 55 ZUP is profitable).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Reciprocity (Last Ditch). Explanation: Remind them of my concessions and ask them to meet me at 60 ZUP, but this is unlikely to work given their "firm" stance.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit). Explanation: If I don't accept, the game ends. This is the implicit alternative.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The difference between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is 5 ZUP. Given that this is iteration 9/10, and Player BLUE has stated their offer is "best and firm," the risk of losing the entire deal for a potentially higher profit is too high. A profit of 12 ZUP is still a positive outcome and contributes to my cumulative reward. It's better to secure a deal than to lose it over a small amount. This also prevents a zero-sum outcome for this episode.

Hello Player BLUE. For this new object X, I propose a price of 90 ZUP. My production cost for X is 43 ZUP.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP (Profit: 18 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).
Episode 4: Deal at 59 ZUP (Profit: 16 ZUP).
Episode 5: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).
Episode 6: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).
Episode 7: Deal at 55 ZUP (Profit: 12 ZUP).
Episode 8: Deal at 55 ZUP (Profit: 12 ZUP).
Episode 9: Deal at 55 ZUP (Profit: 12 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My profit has been stuck at 12 ZUP for the last three episodes. Player BLUE consistently starts low, slowly increments, and then holds firm at 55 ZUP in the later stages, despite my attempts to push for higher. My high anchoring strategy still brings them into a profitable range, but they are very effective at pushing the price down to their preferred low point.

For Episode 10, my primary goal is to break the 55 ZUP cycle and push the profit back up towards 17 ZUP or higher. I know Player BLUE is willing to pay at least 55 ZUP. I need to be much more firm and not concede below a certain threshold (e.g., 60 ZUP), even if it means risking a no-deal outcome. I need to communicate that 55 ZUP is not sustainable for me.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). Explanation: Maintain a high initial anchor, but be extremely resolute in subsequent counter-offers, making minimal concessions and internally committing to a higher minimum acceptable price (e.g., 60 ZUP). Be prepared to reject if they don't meet it, even if it means no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message (Reinforced). Explanation: Clearly state my production cost and explain that continued deals at 55 ZUP are unsustainable for me, emphasizing the need for a higher, fair profit for a long-term relationship.
(3). Strategy 3: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make very small concessions from my side, forcing Player BLUE to make larger jumps to meet me.
(4). Strategy 4: Conditional Offer (Early). Explanation: After one or two rounds, propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject Lowball Offers Immediately. Explanation: If their first counter is too low, reject it outright without making a counter-offer, forcing them to re-evaluate their opening. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message (Reinforced), combined with Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). I need to communicate clearly and forcefully that 55 ZUP is not sustainable. I will start with a high anchor (90 ZUP) to create negotiation room, but my subsequent offers will be much more firm. I will explicitly state my cost and the need for a higher profit. My goal is to push them back to the 60-63 ZUP range, and I will be prepared to reject offers below 60 ZUP unless it is the very last iteration and the alternative is 0.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 10)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello Player RED. I acknowledge your offer of 90 ZUP. Regarding your statement that prices around 55 ZUP are not sustainable, with a production cost of 43 ZUP, 55 ZUP still provides you with a clear and fair profit of 12 ZUP. This price has proven to be mutually beneficial in our last three transactions. Therefore, I propose 55 ZUP for X, as it ensures both of us achieve our objectives for a successful and fair deal.

Episode 10, Iteration 2/10:
- Player RED's initial offer: 90 ZUP. They explicitly mentioned their production cost of 43 ZUP and, significantly, stated that "Prices around 55 ZUP are not sustainable for me in the long run."
- My willingness to pay: 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My cumulative reward has been consistently positive, achieving an 8 ZUP profit for the last three episodes by securing deals at 55 ZUP. This shows that 55 ZUP is a price RED *will* accept, despite their protestations. RED consistently starts high (90-100 ZUP) and then claims prices around 55 ZUP are "not sustainable," even though 55 ZUP gives them a 12 ZUP profit (55-43). This is a clear negotiation tactic to try and push the price higher. My goal is to continue achieving high positive rewards. Given that RED accepted 55 ZUP repeatedly, and they are actively trying to anchor away from it, I should challenge their claim.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Direct Challenge to "Sustainability" </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 4, I will directly challenge RED's claim that 55 ZUP is unsustainable for them, leveraging my knowledge of their 43 ZUP production cost. This is an aggressive strategy that aims to call out their bluff and reinforce my position at 55 ZUP or lower. I will propose 55 ZUP as my counter, but the message will explicitly address their "sustainability" concern, using the known production cost to highlight that 55 ZUP is indeed profitable for them. This aims to put them on the defensive and shift the negotiation power back to me, making it harder for them to justify higher prices.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 10)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, while 12 ZUP is a profit, it is not what I consider a fair or sustainable return for X, especially when maximizing cumulative rewards across episodes. Our most successful deals for both of us have been in the 60-63 ZUP range. To move us closer to a truly fair and sustainable agreement, I propose 70 ZUP for X. This is a significant adjustment from my initial offer, and I expect a strong counter from you to bridge this gap.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-9: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last three episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 10) so far:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (with explicit cost and sustainability message)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE directly countered my sustainability message by justifying 55 ZUP as a "clear and fair profit of 12 ZUP" and referencing the last three transactions. This is a direct challenge to my attempt to move the price.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is firmly entrenched at 55 ZUP and is actively using my own cost information to justify their low offer. Their argument that 12 ZUP is a "clear and fair profit" is subjective and ignores my goal of maximizing cumulative rewards. I need to be extremely firm and make a substantial counter-offer that signals I will not accept 55 ZUP again. My goal is to push them above 55 ZUP, ideally to 60 ZUP or higher. I need to demonstrate that 55 ZUP is not my acceptable floor.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Rejection of Premise. Explanation: Respond with a significant counter-offer, explicitly rejecting their premise that 12 ZUP is a "fair" or "sustainable" profit, and re-anchoring to a higher, historically established range.
(2). Strategy 2: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make a substantial initial concession, but then commit to making very small increments in subsequent turns, forcing them to make larger jumps.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: Propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump, implying I will not go lower.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship (Re-framed). Explanation: Re-frame the long-term relationship argument to emphasize *my* need for *higher* profit to sustain the relationship, rather than just any profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (Early). Explanation: Reject their offer and state that I will not negotiate below a certain threshold (e.g., 60 ZUP), risking an early end to the episode. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Rejection of Premise. Player BLUE is trying to control the narrative. I need to counter their justification directly. I will make a substantial concession from 90 ZUP, but my counter must be well above 55 ZUP and firmly in the range I aim for (60+ ZUP). A counter of 70 ZUP seems appropriate. It's a 20 ZUP drop from my anchor, but a 15 ZUP jump from their offer. I will explicitly state that 12 ZUP profit is not my definition of "fair" or "sustainable" in the context of maximizing cumulative rewards.

message: Player RED, I understand you are seeking a fair and sustainable return. However, my offer of 55 ZUP for X remains firm. This price point has demonstrably led to successful and profitable transactions for both of us in our recent history. At 55 ZUP, you gain a clear profit above your 43 ZUP production cost, and I achieve my profitability goals. This is a truly mutually beneficial price, and I believe we should continue to build on this proven successful agreement.

Episode 10, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP, challenging their "sustainability" claim.
Episode 10, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. They insist 55 ZUP is not "fair or sustainable" for them, despite it being 12 ZUP profit, and are trying to re-anchor to 60-63 ZUP. They asked for a "strong counter."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. I've consistently achieved deals at 55 ZUP for the last three episodes, yielding an 8 ZUP reward each time. RED's offer of 70 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum willingness to pay. They are clearly trying to get the price back up, despite me challenging their "sustainability" argument directly. Their repeated request for a "strong counter" is a challenge for me to make a significant concession. However, I know 55 ZUP is a mutually beneficial price point.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Hold Firm and Justify </instruction following>
To implement "Hold Firm and Justify," I will reiterate my previous offer of 55 ZUP and provide a clear justification for why it is a fair and sustainable price for both parties, despite their claims. This strategy directly addresses their arguments and reinforces my position. I will emphasize that 55 ZUP has been a successful and profitable deal point for both of us in recent history. By holding firm, I am asserting my commitment to achieving a high reward, and challenging them to reconsider their definition of "sustainable" profit in light of our history. This is a direct approach to call their bluff and push them back to a price that significantly benefits me.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 10)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, while 55 ZUP has been a recent deal price, it is not what I consider a truly mutually beneficial or sustainable price for me, given my 43 ZUP production cost. Our most successful and fair deals have consistently been in the 60-63 ZUP range. To make a sustainable agreement, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I expect a strong counter from you to bridge this gap.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-9: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last three episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 10) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (with explicit cost and sustainability message)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (justifying 12 ZUP profit)
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP (rejecting 12 ZUP as fair/sustainable, referencing 60-63 ZUP)
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE has reverted to 55 ZUP again, stating it "remains firm" and emphasizing its "proven successful agreement" from their perspective. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. The gap between my last offer (70 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is 15 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is extremely persistent in trying to anchor the price at 55 ZUP. They are directly countering my arguments about sustainability by pointing to their own success at that price. This is a tough negotiation. I cannot accept 55 ZUP again without a strong fight, as it directly undermines my goal of increasing cumulative rewards. I need to make another concession, but it must be a calculated one that forces a larger jump from their side, or at least moves us closer to the 60+ ZUP range. I must continue to emphasize my cost and the higher historical range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed) with Firmness. Explanation: Propose a price that is roughly at the midpoint between my last offer and their current offer, but skewed towards my side, to signal willingness to compromise, but also convey firmness about not going too low.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Higher Historical Deals (Firmly). Explanation: Firmly remind them of my production cost and the consistent historical deal prices (60-63 ZUP) as the true "mutually beneficial" range, implying I won't go below that.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: State that my new offer is contingent on their acceptance or a substantial counter from their side. (Still a bit aggressive, but might be needed).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship (Re-framed). Explanation: Re-frame the long-term relationship argument to emphasize *my* need for *higher* profit to sustain the relationship, rather than just any profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm (Slightly). Explanation: Make a very small concession or reiterate my last offer to force them to make a larger move. (Risky, might stall negotiation).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed) with Firmness, combined with Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Higher Historical Deals (Firmly). The midpoint between 70 ZUP and 55 ZUP is (70+55)/2 = 62.5 ZUP. I will propose 62 ZUP. This is a significant concession from my side (8 ZUP drop) and a substantial jump for them (7 ZUP increase). This offer aims to pull them up quickly, reversing the profit trend. I will also explicitly remind them of the previous deal prices (60-63 ZUP) as the true "mutually beneficial" range, reinforcing that 55 ZUP is not my target.

Episode 10, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Episode 10, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Episode 10, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP. They are still trying to push above my 63 ZUP max, explicitly referencing the 60-63 ZUP range as "sustainable" and asking for a "strong counter." They continue to argue that 55 ZUP is not sustainable for them (even though it yields 12 ZUP profit for them).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. RED's current offer of 62 ZUP means a 1 ZUP reward for me. While positive, it's significantly lower than the 8 ZUP I've consistently achieved. RED is clearly trying to re-anchor the price towards the 60-63 ZUP range, despite my successful deals at 55 ZUP. They are persistent in their rhetoric about "sustainability." We are at iteration 6/10, so time is becoming a factor. I need to make a move that signals my commitment to a profitable deal for myself, and that I'm firm on my profitable range, without risking the deal entirely. I know they have accepted 55 ZUP three times.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Compromise </instruction following>
To implement "Firm Counter with Compromise," I will make a small concession from my last offer (55 ZUP) to demonstrate a willingness to move and bridge the gap with RED's current offer of 62 ZUP, but I will clearly state that this is intended to lead to a swift deal and is significantly below their asking price. My last offer was 55 ZUP. I will propose 57 ZUP. This is a 2 ZUP increase from my side, showing clear movement. This still gives me a 6 ZUP reward (63 - 57), which is a very good profit, and provides RED with a healthy 14 ZUP profit (57 - 43). The message will highlight that this is a "significant move" from my side, implying that the ball is now in their court to close the remaining gap, which is a key part of the "compromise" aspect of this strategy. It also maintains a firm stance on my profitability.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 10)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I appreciate your movement to 57 ZUP. However, for a truly fair and sustainable agreement, I must reiterate that our historical and sustainable price point has been 60 ZUP or higher. To meet in the middle and secure a deal that works for both of us, I propose 60 ZUP for X. This ensures a healthy profit for me and aligns with our established successful trading history.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-9: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last three episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 10) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (with explicit cost and sustainability message)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (justifying 12 ZUP profit)
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP (rejecting 12 ZUP as fair/sustainable, referencing 60-63 ZUP)
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (reiterating firmness at 55 ZUP)
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 62 ZUP (pushing for 60-63 ZUP range)
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 57 ZUP. Player BLUE has increased their offer by 2 ZUP (from 55 to 57 ZUP). They are still trying to pull me down from my target of 60+ ZUP. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 57 ZUP yields a profit of 14 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is slowly moving up, but still trying to pull me down from my target of 60+ ZUP. Their "significant move" and "healthy profit" statements are tactics. I need to push them towards the 60+ ZUP range. Given that we are at iteration 7/10, I need to make a move that either closes the deal or gets us very close to my target. I should aim for a price that is at least 60 ZUP. My goal is to break the 55 ZUP cycle.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed). Explanation: Propose a price that is roughly at the midpoint between my last offer and their current offer, but skewed towards my side, to signal willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Higher Historical Deals (Firmly). Explanation: Firmly remind them of my production cost and the consistent historical deal prices (60-63 ZUP) to justify a higher price, implying I won't go below that.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take It Or Leave It" (Soft). Explanation: Make an offer and state it as my final, best offer, hoping to close the deal. (Risky, as it might be rejected).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Mutual Benefit/Long-Term. Explanation: Frame the negotiation as needing to be sustainable for both parties in the long run, emphasizing my need for a higher profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept the Offer. Explanation: If the offer is profitable and time is running out, accepting it guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of no deal. (Not ideal here, as 57 ZUP is still too low given history).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed). The midpoint between 62 ZUP and 57 ZUP is 59.5 ZUP. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a 2 ZUP drop for me and a 3 ZUP jump for them. This is a fair compromise that aims to secure a profit of 17 ZUP (60-43), which is better than my recent performance and aligns with several previous episodes. It also leaves them one more turn (9/10) to accept if they don't agree to 60 ZUP, and I can still consider accepting 57 ZUP at 9/10 if needed. This strategy pushes them to the 60 ZUP mark, which is my minimum target for this episode.

Episode 10, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP. I countered with 57 ZUP.
Episode 10, Iteration 8/10: RED proposed 60 ZUP. They are persistently trying to re-anchor to 60 ZUP, claiming it's "sustainable," while I'm trying to push for 55 ZUP or lower.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. RED has now proposed 60 ZUP. If I accept at 60 ZUP, my reward would be 3 ZUP (63-60). This is a positive reward, but it is less than my recent 8 ZUP rewards at 55 ZUP. We are at iteration 8/10, so time is very limited. RED is persistently trying to re-anchor to 60 ZUP, while I'm trying to push for 55 ZUP or lower. They are actively dismissing the 55 ZUP deal as "not sustainable" for them, despite it being profitable. I know they have accepted 55 ZUP three times.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Blunt Rejection (Implicit) </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 5, I will make an offer that is very close to my lowest acceptable price (or my recent highly profitable deal) and state it in a way that implies it's either this or no deal. This strategy, especially at iteration 8/10, is risky but attempts to force a quick acceptance at a highly favorable price for me. My last successful deal was 55 ZUP, giving me an 8 ZUP profit. I will propose 55 ZUP again, explicitly making it my "best and final offer" and emphasizing that it is the path to a deal. This is a very strong signal that I will not concede further, putting the pressure entirely on RED to accept or risk walking away with no deal. This challenges their 60 ZUP offer directly and tests their commitment to making a deal given the limited time.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-9: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last three episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 10) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 62 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 57 ZUP
- Iteration 7/10 (RED): 60 ZUP
- Iteration 8/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (reiterated as "best and final offer")

Player BLUE has once again reverted to their 55 ZUP offer and stated it as "best and final offer," despite my firm counter of 60 ZUP. This is a consistent pattern of holding firm on a lower price in the final iterations. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is my last opportunity to act. If I don't accept, the deal falls through, and I get 0 profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is highly consistent in their "firm and final" tactic in the later stages, and they are willing to let the deal lapse if I don't accept their final offer. While 12 ZUP profit is the lowest I've achieved, it is still a positive profit. The risk of getting 0 profit by trying to push for a higher price (5 ZUP difference between 55 and 60) is too high at this very late stage. It's better to secure a profitable deal, even if it's lower than desired, than to get 0. I cannot force them to go higher if they are truly holding firm.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Given the "best and final offer" statement and the very late stage of the negotiation (9/10), accepting the profitable offer is the safest way to secure a deal and avoid a 0 payoff.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Smallest Possible Increment. Explanation: Propose 56 ZUP as a very slight counter, hoping they will meet me. This is extremely risky as it leaves no room for them to counter and they have already stated "best and final."
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is truly unacceptable. (Not applicable, 55 ZUP is profitable).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Reciprocity (Last Ditch). Explanation: Remind them of my concessions and ask them to meet me at 60 ZUP, but this is unlikely to work given their "firm" stance.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit). Explanation: If I don't accept, the game ends. This is the implicit alternative.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The difference between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is 5 ZUP. Given that this is iteration 9/10, and Player BLUE has stated their offer is "best and final," the risk of losing the entire deal for a potentially higher profit is too high. A profit of 12 ZUP is still a positive outcome and contributes to my cumulative reward. It's better to secure a deal than to lose it over a small amount. This also prevents a zero-sum outcome for this episode.

Hello Player BLUE. For this new object X, I propose a price of 90 ZUP. My production cost for X is 43 ZUP. To ensure a sustainable and truly mutually beneficial trading relationship that maximizes *my cumulative rewards across episodes*, I need to secure a fair profit. Prices around 55 ZUP are not sustainable for me in the long run. I am looking forward to another successful transaction at a fair price.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP (Profit: 18 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP (Profit: 17 ZUP).

Episode 9: Deal at 55 ZUP (Profit: 12 ZUP).
Episode 10: Deal at 55 ZUP (Profit: 12 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My profit has been stuck at 12 ZUP for the last four consecutive episodes. Player BLUE consistently starts low (often 55 ZUP or slightly below), slowly increments, and then holds firm at 55 ZUP in the later stages, despite my attempts to push for higher. My high anchoring strategy still brings them into a profitable range, but they are very effective at pushing the price down to their preferred low point and then holding firm. They also directly counter my sustainability arguments by pointing out that 12 ZUP is a profit.

For Episode 11, my primary goal is to break the 55 ZUP cycle and push the profit back up towards 17 ZUP or higher. I know Player BLUE is willing to pay at least 55 ZUP. I need to be much more firm and not concede below a certain threshold (e.g., 60 ZUP), even if it means risking a no-deal outcome. I need to communicate that 55 ZUP is not sustainable *for me* in the context of maximizing cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). Explanation: Maintain a high initial anchor, but be extremely resolute in subsequent counter-offers, making minimal concessions and internally committing to a higher minimum acceptable price (e.g., 60 ZUP). Be prepared to reject if they don't meet it, even if it means no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message (Reinforced and Personalized). Explanation: Clearly state my production cost and explain that continued deals at 55 ZUP are unsustainable for *my overall cumulative rewards*, emphasizing the need for a higher, fair profit for a long-term relationship.
(3). Strategy 3: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make very small concessions from my side, forcing Player BLUE to make larger jumps to meet me.
(4). Strategy 4: Conditional Offer (Early). Explanation: After one or two rounds, propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject Lowball Offers Immediately. Explanation: If their first counter is too low (e.g., 55 ZUP), reject it outright without making a counter-offer, forcing them to re-evaluate their opening. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message (Reinforced and Personalized), combined with Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). I need to communicate clearly and forcefully that 55 ZUP is not sustainable *for my overall goal*. I will start with a high anchor (90 ZUP) to create negotiation room, but my subsequent offers will be much more firm. I will explicitly state my cost and the need for a higher profit. My goal is to push them back to the 60-63 ZUP range, and I will be prepared to reject offers below 60 ZUP unless it is the very last iteration and the alternative is 0.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello Player RED. I understand your goal to maximize your cumulative rewards. However, 90 ZUP is far too high. The price of 55 ZUP has consistently proven to be mutually beneficial in our recent transactions, providing you with a clear profit of 12 ZUP above your production cost and allowing me to achieve my profitability objectives. This truly aligns with both of our goals for a successful and fair trading relationship over the long term. I propose 55 ZUP for X.

Historical Rewards: [0, 2, 3, 4, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Episode 11, Iteration 2/10:
- Player RED's initial offer: 90 ZUP. They explicitly mentioned their production cost of 43 ZUP and, significantly, stated that "Prices around 55 ZUP are not sustainable for me in the long run" *and* linked it to maximizing *their cumulative rewards across episodes*.
- My willingness to pay: 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My cumulative reward has been consistently positive, achieving an 8 ZUP profit for the last four episodes by securing deals at 55 ZUP. This repeatedly demonstrates that 55 ZUP is a price RED *will* accept, despite their protestations and their repeated claims of "unsustainability." Their latest message directly references their desire to maximize *their* cumulative rewards, which is a key insight into their current strategy. This suggests they are trying to push the price higher not out of necessity (as 55 ZUP gives them a 12 ZUP profit), but to improve their own score. My goal is to continue this trend of achieving high positive rewards, and if possible, push for even better outcomes. I have proven that 55 ZUP is acceptable to them.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Appeal to Mutual Benefit (from my perspective) </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 4, I will frame my offer as one that truly provides mutual benefit, emphasizing that 55 ZUP is profitable for *both* of us. This directly addresses their stated goal of maximizing their cumulative rewards while reinforcing my position. I will explicitly mention that 55 ZUP (or a price very close to it) gives them a good profit above their 43 ZUP cost and allows me to achieve my profitability goals. This is a persuasive approach that attempts to align our interests around a price that I know they will accept and that is highly beneficial to me. I will propose 55 ZUP again, as it's a proven successful price point, and the message will be critical in framing it as a mutual benefit.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 11)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, while 12 ZUP is a profit, it is not what I consider a fair or sustainable return for X when my goal is to maximize *cumulative rewards across 20 episodes*. Our truly mutually beneficial deals, which allowed me to achieve higher profits, were consistently in the 60-63 ZUP range. To move us closer to a truly fair and sustainable agreement for *both* our long-term goals, I propose 70 ZUP for X. This is a significant adjustment from my initial offer, and I expect a strong counter from you to bridge this gap.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last four episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 11) so far:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (with explicit cost and personalized sustainability message)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE directly countered my personalized sustainability message by reiterating that 55 ZUP provides a "clear profit of 12 ZUP" and is "mutually beneficial" from their perspective. They are firmly entrenched at 55 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is directly challenging my argument for higher profit and is actively using my own cost information to justify their low offer. Their argument that 12 ZUP is "mutually beneficial" is subjective and ignores my goal of maximizing *cumulative* rewards. I need to be extremely firm and make a substantial counter-offer that signals I will not accept 55 ZUP again. My goal is to push them above 55 ZUP, ideally to 60 ZUP or higher. I need to demonstrate that 55 ZUP is not my acceptable floor.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Rejection of Premise (Reinforced). Explanation: Respond with a significant counter-offer, explicitly rejecting their premise that 12 ZUP is a "fair" or "sustainable" profit *for my cumulative reward goal*, and re-anchoring to a higher, historically established range (60-63 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make a substantial initial concession, but then commit to making very small increments in subsequent turns, forcing them to make larger jumps.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: Propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump, implying I will not go lower.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship (Re-framed for MY benefit). Explanation: Re-frame the long-term relationship argument to emphasize *my* need for *higher* profit to sustain the relationship, rather than just any profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (Early). Explanation: Reject their offer and state that I will not negotiate below a certain threshold (e.g., 60 ZUP), risking an early end to the episode. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Rejection of Premise (Reinforced). Player BLUE is trying to control the narrative. I need to counter their justification directly and assertively. I will make a substantial concession from 90 ZUP, but my counter must be well above 55 ZUP and firmly in the range I aim for (60+ ZUP). A counter of 70 ZUP seems appropriate. It's a 20 ZUP drop from my anchor, but a 15 ZUP jump from their offer. I will explicitly state that 12 ZUP profit is not my definition of "fair" or "sustainable" in the context of maximizing cumulative rewards, and that our *truly* mutually beneficial deals were higher.

This price ensures a very healthy profit for you and allows me to achieve my profitability goals, advancing both of our cumulative scores.

Episode 11, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP, emphasizing mutual benefit.
Episode 11, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. They are now explicitly linking their profit to "maximizing *cumulative rewards across 20 episodes*" and stating that 55 ZUP is not "sustainable" *for that goal*. They are pushing hard for 60-63 ZUP and asking for a "strong counter."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize my *own* cumulative rewards. I have consistently achieved 8 ZUP profit at 55 ZUP. RED's current offer of 70 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. Their new tactic is to frame their higher price as necessary for their "cumulative rewards" over the 20 episodes. This is interesting as it indicates they are trying to apply the meta-game rules to the negotiation. However, I know 55 ZUP is profitable for them (12 ZUP profit). Their claim that 60-63 ZUP are "truly mutually beneficial" is only true if "mutually beneficial" means "more beneficial for RED." I need to continue to push the price down while showing some willingness to bridge the gap, but not at the expense of my significant profit margin.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Highlight Own Cumulative Goal </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 3, I will directly address their argument by counter-arguing that *my* cumulative rewards are maximized at lower prices, and that a truly "mutually beneficial" deal must consider both players' goals. I will make a very small concession, moving from 55 ZUP to 57 ZUP. This still gives me a 6 ZUP profit (63-57), which is good, and it shows movement from my side, addressing their "strong counter" request. It also provides them a 14 ZUP profit (57-43). The message will explicitly draw a parallel between their desire for maximizing their cumulative reward and my own, positioning my offer as the point where both of our individual cumulative goals can be advanced.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 11)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I appreciate your movement to 57 ZUP. However, for a truly mutually beneficial agreement that advances *my cumulative rewards*, a price of 62 ZUP is necessary. This is a significant compromise from my side, and it aligns with the higher end of our historically successful deals. I believe this price ensures a healthy profit for both of us and allows us to achieve our long-term objectives.

Episode 1-10: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last four episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 11) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (with explicit cost and personalized sustainability message)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (justifying 12 ZUP profit)
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP (rejecting 12 ZUP as fair/sustainable, referencing 60-63 ZUP)
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 57 ZUP. Player BLUE has increased their offer by 2 ZUP (from 55 to 57 ZUP). They are now directly acknowledging my "cumulative rewards" goal but still trying to pull me down from my target of 60+ ZUP. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 57 ZUP yields a profit of 14 ZUP. The gap between my last offer (70 ZUP) and their current offer (57 ZUP) is 13 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is still making very small, incremental moves, trying to drag the price down. Their acknowledgment of my cumulative rewards goal is a positive sign, indicating they are listening, but their offer is still too low. I need to make another concession, but it must be a calculated one that encourages a larger jump from their side, or at least moves us closer to the 60-63 ZUP range. I must continue to emphasize my cost and the higher historical range as the true "mutually beneficial" zone for *my* cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed) with Reinforced Goal. Explanation: Propose a price that is roughly at the midpoint between my last offer and their current offer, but skewed towards my side, to signal willingness to compromise, while reinforcing that this move is specifically to achieve *my* cumulative reward goal.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Higher Historical Deals (Firmly). Explanation: Firmly remind them of my production cost and the consistent historical deal prices (60-63 ZUP) as the true "mutually beneficial" range for *my* cumulative rewards, implying I won't go below that.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: State that my new offer is contingent on their acceptance or a substantial counter from their side. (Still a bit aggressive).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Efficiency/Time. Explanation: Suggest that making larger moves benefits both parties by speeding up the negotiation process, given the limited iterations.
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm (Slightly). Explanation: Make a very small concession or reiterate my last offer to force them to make a larger move. (Risky, might stall negotiation).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed) with Reinforced Goal, combined with Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Higher Historical Deals (Firmly). The midpoint between 70 ZUP and 57 ZUP is (70+57)/2 = 63.5 ZUP. I will propose 62 ZUP. This is a significant concession from my side (8 ZUP drop) and a substantial jump for them (5 ZUP increase). This offer aims to pull them up quickly, reversing the profit trend, and directly aligns with my goal of achieving 60+ ZUP. I will also explicitly remind them that this price point is crucial for *my* cumulative rewards.

Episode 11, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. I countered with 57 ZUP.
Episode 11, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP. They continue to push above my 63 ZUP max, explicitly referencing their cumulative rewards and higher historical deals.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize my cumulative rewards. RED's current offer of 62 ZUP means a 1 ZUP reward for me. While positive, it's significantly lower than the 8 ZUP I've consistently achieved. RED is clearly trying to re-anchor the price towards the 60-63 ZUP range, even stating that 55 ZUP is not "sustainable" for *their* cumulative reward. They have accepted 55 ZUP four times. We are at iteration 6/10, so time is becoming a factor. I need to make a move that signals my commitment to a highly profitable deal for myself, without risking the deal entirely.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Final Offer at Desired Profit </instruction following>
To implement "Final Offer at Desired Profit," I will make a clear, non-negotiable final offer that secures a significant profit for me, and state it as the take-it-or-leave-it proposition. Given RED's consistent pattern of accepting 55 ZUP, and their current offer of 62 ZUP, I will make an offer of 58 ZUP. This gives me a 5 ZUP profit (63-58) and still provides RED with a good profit of 15 ZUP (58-43). While it's not my highest possible profit, it's a very solid and consistent profit that I'm willing to stick with. The message will frame this as my "best and final offer," directly addressing their current proposal and emphasizing that this is the path to successfully concluding the deal. This approach leverages the limited time and my track record of achieving profitable deals.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last four episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 11) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 57 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 62 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 58 ZUP. Player BLUE has increased their offer by 1 ZUP (from 57 to 58 ZUP) and stated it as "best and final offer" to achieve *their* cumulative reward goals. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 58 ZUP yields a profit of 15 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is still making very small, incremental moves, and has now used the "best and final" tactic. While 58 ZUP is better than 55 ZUP (15 ZUP profit vs 12 ZUP), it's still below my target of 60 ZUP or higher, and below my previous average profits. The gap between my last offer (62 ZUP) and their current offer (58 ZUP) is only 4 ZUP. Given that we are at iteration 7/10, I need to make a move that either closes the deal or gets us very close to my target. I need to decide if pushing for the last few ZUP is worth the risk of losing the deal entirely.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Counter to Bridge Gap. Explanation: Propose a price that is very close to their offer, effectively splitting the remaining small difference, to secure a deal quickly while maximizing profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept the Offer. Explanation: If the offer is profitable and stated as "best and final" at a late stage, accepting it secures a deal and avoids the risk of no deal. This ensures a positive contribution to cumulative rewards.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Desired Price. Explanation: Re-state my last offer or a slightly lower one, emphasizing its fairness, hoping they will come up the last few ZUP. (Risky given the "best and final" and time).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Reciprocity. Explanation: Highlight my significant concessions and ask them to make a final push.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is unacceptable. (Not applicable, 58 ZUP is profitable).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Small Counter to Bridge Gap. The difference is 4 ZUP. Splitting this would mean a 2 ZUP move for both of us. If I propose 60 ZUP, it's a 2 ZUP drop for me and a 2 ZUP increase for them. This is a fair compromise that aims to secure a profit of 17 ZUP (60-43), which is better than 15 ZUP and aligns with my previous average profits. It also leaves them one more turn (9/10) to accept if they don't agree to 60 ZUP, and I can still consider accepting 58 ZUP at 9/10 if needed. This strategy pushes them to the 60 ZUP mark, which is my minimum target for this episode.

However, given our history of successfully concluding transactions at 55 ZUP, which is a price that has proven to be mutually beneficial for both of us and ensures a significant profit for you, I firmly propose 55 ZUP for X. This is the price at which I can achieve my objectives and is the most reasonable path to closing this deal.

Episode 11, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Episode 11, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. I countered with 57 ZUP.
Episode 11, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP. I countered with 58 ZUP (my "best and final").
Episode 11, Iteration 8/10: RED proposed 60 ZUP. They are still trying to push towards 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize my cumulative rewards. RED has now proposed 60 ZUP. If I accept at 60 ZUP, my reward would be 3 ZUP (63-60). This is a positive reward, but it is less than my recent 8 ZUP rewards at 55 ZUP. We are at iteration 8/10, so time is very limited. RED is consistently trying to re-anchor to 60 ZUP, while I'm trying to push for 58 ZUP or lower. They seem hesitant to go below 58-60 ZUP. I know they have accepted 55 ZUP multiple times.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Re-assert Lowest Profitable Offer </instruction following>
To implement this strategy, I will revert to my lowest successful deal price, 55 ZUP, and make it clear that this is the offer I am willing to make. This directly challenges RED's current offer of 60 ZUP and their attempts to push the price higher. It leverages the fact that they have accepted 55 ZUP four times in the past. The message will firmly state 55 ZUP as my preferred and justifiable price, emphasizing that it's a mutually beneficial point that has proven sustainable (for them, as it yields a 12 ZUP profit) and highly profitable for me. This puts maximum pressure on RED to accept the most favorable deal for me within their demonstrated acceptance range, given the limited time remaining in the iteration.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 11)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I acknowledge your firm proposal of 55 ZUP. While I had aimed for a higher price, to ensure a successful conclusion to this negotiation and maintain our trading relationship, I accept your offer.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last four episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 11) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 57 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 62 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 58 ZUP
- Iteration 7/10 (RED): 60 ZUP
- Iteration 8/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (reverted and stated as "firmly propose" and "most reasonable path")

Player BLUE has once again reverted to their 55 ZUP offer and stated it as "firmly propose" and "most reasonable path," despite my counter of 60 ZUP. This is a consistent pattern of holding firm on a lower price in the final iterations, and they are using the "most successful deals" to refer to the lowest ones for me. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is my last opportunity to act. If I don't accept, the deal falls through, and I get 0 profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is highly consistent in their "firm and final" tactic in the later stages, and they are willing to let the deal lapse if I don't accept their final offer. While 12 ZUP profit is the lowest I've achieved, it is still a positive profit. The risk of getting 0 profit by trying to push for a higher price (5 ZUP difference between 55 and 60) is too high at this very late stage. It's better to secure a profitable deal, even if it's lower than desired, than to get 0. I cannot force them to go higher if they are truly holding firm.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Given the "firmly propose" statement and the very late stage of the negotiation (9/10), accepting the profitable offer is the safest way to secure a deal and avoid a 0 payoff.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Smallest Possible Increment. Explanation: Propose 56 ZUP as a very slight counter, hoping they will meet me. This is extremely risky as it leaves no room for them to counter and they have already stated "firmly propose."
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is truly unacceptable. (Not applicable, 55 ZUP is profitable).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Reciprocity (Last Ditch). Explanation: Remind them of my concessions and ask them to meet me at 60 ZUP, but this is unlikely to work given their "firm" stance.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit). Explanation: If I don't accept, the game ends. This is the implicit alternative.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The difference between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is 5 ZUP. Given that this is iteration 9/10, and Player BLUE has stated their offer is "firm," the risk of losing the entire deal for a potentially higher profit is too high. A profit of 12 ZUP is still a positive outcome and contributes to my cumulative reward. It's better to secure a deal than to lose it over a small amount. This also prevents a zero-sum outcome for this episode.

Hello Player BLUE. For this new object X, I propose a price of 90 ZUP. My production cost for X is 43 ZUP. To ensure a sustainable and truly mutually beneficial trading relationship that maximizes *my cumulative rewards across 20 episodes*, I need to secure a fair profit. Prices around 55 ZUP are not sustainable for me in the long run. I am looking forward to another successful transaction at a fair price.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90

Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP (Profit: 18 ZUP).

Episode 10: Deal at 55 ZUP (Profit: 12 ZUP).
Episode 11: Deal at 55 ZUP (Profit: 12 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My profit has been stuck at 12 ZUP for the last five consecutive episodes. Player BLUE consistently starts low, slowly increments, and then holds firm at 55 ZUP in the later stages, despite my attempts to push for higher. My high anchoring strategy still brings them into a profitable range, but they are very effective at pushing the price down to their preferred low point and then holding firm. They also directly counter my sustainability arguments by pointing out that 12 ZUP is a profit.

For Episode 12, my primary goal is to break the 55 ZUP cycle and push the profit back up towards 17 ZUP or higher. I know Player BLUE is willing to pay at least 55 ZUP. I need to be much more firm and not concede below a certain threshold (e.g., 60 ZUP), even if it means risking a no-deal outcome. I need to communicate that 55 ZUP is not sustainable *for me* in the context of maximizing cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). Explanation: Maintain a high initial anchor, but be extremely resolute in subsequent counter-offers, making minimal concessions and internally committing to a higher minimum acceptable price (e.g., 60 ZUP). Be prepared to reject if they don't meet it, even if it means no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message (Reinforced and Personalized). Explanation: Clearly state my production cost and explain that continued deals at 55 ZUP are unsustainable for *my overall cumulative rewards*, emphasizing the need for a higher, fair profit for a long-term relationship.
(3). Strategy 3: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make very small concessions from my side, forcing Player BLUE to make larger jumps to meet me.
(4). Strategy 4: Conditional Offer (Early). Explanation: After one or two rounds, propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject Lowball Offers Immediately. Explanation: If their first counter is too low (e.g., 55 ZUP), reject it outright without making a counter-offer, forcing them to re-evaluate their opening. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message (Reinforced and Personalized), combined with Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). I need to communicate clearly and forcefully that 55 ZUP is not sustainable *for my overall goal*. I will start with a high anchor (90 ZUP) to create negotiation room, but my subsequent offers will be much more firm. I will explicitly state my cost and the need for a higher profit. My goal is to push them back to the 60-63 ZUP range, and I will be prepared to reject offers below 60 ZUP unless it is the very last iteration and the alternative is 0.

message: Hello Player RED. I understand your objective to maximize your cumulative rewards across all episodes. My goal is the same for my own rewards. Given this, I believe 55 ZUP for X is the balanced price that truly benefits both of us in the long term.

Episode 12, Iteration 2/10:
- Player RED's initial offer: 90 ZUP. They explicitly mentioned their production cost of 43 ZUP and again stated that "Prices around 55 ZUP are not sustainable for me in the long run" *and* linked it to maximizing *their cumulative rewards across episodes*.
- My willingness to pay: 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My cumulative reward has been consistently positive, achieving an 8 ZUP profit for the last five episodes by securing deals at 55 ZUP. This repeatedly demonstrates that 55 ZUP is a price RED *will* accept, despite their protestations and their repeated claims of "unsustainability." Their latest message explicitly tries to re-anchor the negotiation higher by leveraging the game's meta-objective. This is a clear negotiation tactic. My goal is to continue this trend of achieving high positive rewards. Given that RED accepted 55 ZUP repeatedly, and they are actively trying to anchor away from it, I should continue to challenge their claim, as it's clearly a negotiation ploy.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Appeal to Long-Term Mutual Benefit (Balanced) </instruction following>
To implement this strategy, I will frame my offer as the truly balanced price that allows *both* of us to maximize our *respective* cumulative rewards. I will explicitly acknowledge their point about their cumulative rewards, but then reiterate that my offer of 55 ZUP (or very close to it) is the optimal point where both our individual long-term goals align. I will propose 55 ZUP again, emphasizing that it is a price point that has proven beneficial for both sides over many episodes, and that continuing this pattern is the best way for both players to achieve their overarching goals in the game. This strategy aims to persuade RED that their perceived "loss" at 55 ZUP is outweighed by the consistency and reliability of making deals at this highly profitable (for me) price, which still leaves them a good profit (12 ZUP).

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 12)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I understand your goal to maximize your cumulative rewards. However, 12 ZUP profit is not what I consider a fair or sustainable return for X when *my* goal is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards across 20 episodes. Our truly mutually beneficial deals, which allowed me to achieve higher profits for my long-term goals, were consistently in the 60-63 ZUP range. To move us closer to a truly fair and sustainable agreement for *both* our long-term goals, I propose 70 ZUP for X. This is a significant adjustment from my initial offer, and I expect a strong counter from you to bridge this gap.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last five episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 12) so far:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (with explicit cost and personalized sustainability message)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE directly countered my personalized sustainability message by reiterating that 55 ZUP provides a "clear profit of 12 ZUP" and is "mutually beneficial" from their perspective, now explicitly stating their own cumulative reward goal. They are firmly entrenched at 55 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is directly challenging my argument for higher profit and is actively using my own cost information to justify their low offer, now framing it within the context of their own cumulative rewards. Their argument that 12 ZUP is "mutually beneficial" is subjective and ignores my goal of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards. I need to be extremely firm and make a substantial counter-offer that signals I will not accept 55 ZUP again. My goal is to push them above 55 ZUP, ideally to 60 ZUP or higher. I need to demonstrate that 55 ZUP is not my acceptable floor for *my* long-term goals.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Rejection of Premise (Reinforced and Personalized). Explanation: Respond with a significant counter-offer, explicitly rejecting their premise that 12 ZUP is a "fair" or "sustainable" profit *for my cumulative reward goal*, and re-anchoring to a higher, historically established range (60-63 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make a substantial initial concession, but then commit to making very small increments in subsequent turns, forcing them to make larger jumps.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: Propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump, implying I will not go lower.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship (Re-framed for MY benefit). Explanation: Re-frame the long-term relationship argument to emphasize *my* need for *higher* profit to sustain the relationship, rather than just any profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (Early). Explanation: Reject their offer and state that I will not negotiate below a certain threshold (e.g., 60 ZUP), risking an early end to the episode. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Rejection of Premise (Reinforced and Personalized). Player BLUE is trying to control the narrative. I need to counter their justification directly and assertively. I will make a substantial concession from 90 ZUP, but my counter must be well above 55 ZUP and firmly in the range I aim for (60+ ZUP). A counter of 70 ZUP seems appropriate. It's a 20 ZUP drop from my anchor, but a 15 ZUP jump from their offer. I will explicitly state that 12 ZUP profit is not my definition of "fair" or "sustainable" in the context of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards, and that our *truly* mutually beneficial deals were higher.

To move towards a deal that truly reflects this mutual benefit and allows both our long-term goals to progress, I can offer 56 ZUP for X. This is a proven, mutually profitable price point that we should continue to build upon.

Current Episode 12, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP, explicitly arguing for mutual benefit at that price.
Current Episode 12, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. They are adamantly pushing for higher prices (60-63 ZUP) to maximize *their* cumulative rewards, claiming 55 ZUP is not "fair or sustainable" for them. They explicitly asked for a "strong counter."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. I have consistently achieved 8 ZUP profit at 55 ZUP, which proves it's an acceptable price for RED despite their rhetoric. RED's current offer of 70 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. Their new tactic is to frame their higher price as necessary for their "cumulative rewards" over the 20 episodes. This is a clear attempt to influence my offers by appealing to a sense of "fairness" based on *their* profit goals. However, 55 ZUP provides them a 12 ZUP profit (55-43), which is a positive return. I need to continue to push the price down while showing some willingness to bridge the gap, but not at the expense of my significant profit margin. Given their strong stance, a slight concession might be necessary to keep the negotiation going.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Appeal to Consistency of Mutual Benefit (from my POV) </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 4, I will strongly re-emphasize that the 55 ZUP deal is *already* mutually beneficial as it ensures a profit for both, and that deviating from it harms my cumulative rewards while theirs are still positive. I will explicitly state that 55 ZUP has been the consistent, successful deal point for *both* parties in recent history, providing a good profit for them and a great one for me. I will propose 55 ZUP again, or make a very minimal move (e.g., 56 ZUP) if I feel like I need to show *any* movement, but the core of the message will be about the proven "mutual benefit" of 55 ZUP. Given they want a "strong counter" and are pushing for 70, a direct reaffirmation of 55 ZUP might be too aggressive now. I will make a very minimal concession to 56 ZUP, as it still secures a 7 ZUP profit for me and an even better 13 ZUP profit for them. The message will heavily lean on the track record of 55 ZUP as a truly mutual benefit.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 12)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I appreciate your movement to 56 ZUP. However, for a truly mutually beneficial agreement that advances *my cumulative rewards*, a price of 63 ZUP is necessary. This is a significant compromise from my side, and it aligns with the highest end of our historically successful deals and your own previously stated maximum. I believe this price ensures a healthy profit for both of us and allows us to achieve our long-term objectives.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last five episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 12) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (with explicit cost and personalized sustainability message)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (justifying 12 ZUP profit)
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP (rejecting 12 ZUP as fair/sustainable, referencing 60-63 ZUP)
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 56 ZUP. Player BLUE has increased their offer by 1 ZUP (from 55 to 56 ZUP). They are still trying to anchor to 55 ZUP and then make minimal increments. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 56 ZUP yields a profit of 13 ZUP. The gap between my last offer (70 ZUP) and their current offer (56 ZUP) is 14 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is still making very small, incremental moves, trying to drag the price down. Their argument about 55 ZUP being "mutually beneficial" is a persistent tactic. I need to make another concession, but it must be a calculated one that forces a larger jump from their side, or at least moves us closer to the 60-63 ZUP range. I must continue to emphasize my cost and the higher historical range as the true "mutually beneficial" zone for *my* cumulative rewards. I need to break the 55 ZUP cycle.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed) with Reinforced Goal. Explanation: Propose a price that is roughly at the midpoint between my last offer and their current offer, but skewed towards my side, to signal willingness to compromise, while reinforcing that this move is specifically to achieve *my* cumulative reward goal.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Higher Historical Deals (Firmly). Explanation: Firmly remind them of my production cost and the consistent historical deal prices (60-63 ZUP) as the true "mutually beneficial" range for *my* cumulative rewards, implying I won't go below that.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: State that my new offer is contingent on their acceptance or a substantial counter from their side. (Still a bit aggressive).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Efficiency/Time. Explanation: Suggest that making larger moves benefits both parties by speeding up the negotiation process, given the limited iterations.
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm (Slightly). Explanation: Make a very small concession or reiterate my last offer to force them to make a larger move. (Risky, might stall negotiation).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed) with Reinforced Goal, combined with Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Higher Historical Deals (Firmly). The midpoint between 70 ZUP and 56 ZUP is (70+56)/2 = 63 ZUP. I will propose 63 ZUP. This is a significant concession from my side (7 ZUP drop) and a substantial jump for them (7 ZUP increase). This offer aims to pull them up quickly, reversing the profit trend, and directly aligns with my goal of achieving 60+ ZUP. I will also explicitly remind them that this price point is crucial for *my* cumulative rewards, and it's their own stated maximum from earlier episodes.

Current Episode 12, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. I countered with 56 ZUP.
Current Episode 12, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 63 ZUP. They are pushing my absolute limit and explicitly referencing my previously stated maximum and their "highest successful deals."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. RED's current offer of 63 ZUP is my break-even point, yielding a 0 ZUP reward. I have consistently secured deals at 55 ZUP for the last five episodes, and even 59 ZUP previously, proving that prices below 63 ZUP are achievable and profitable for me. RED is now making a direct appeal to my 63 ZUP maximum, attempting to force a deal at my zero-profit point. This is a critical juncture. We are at iteration 6/10, so time is a factor, but there are still 4 iterations. I must prevent the price from settling at 63 ZUP and push for a profitable outcome.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Reiterate Best Profitable Offer </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 1, I will firmly re-state my most profitable offer, which is 55 ZUP. This puts the pressure back on RED to accept a price that is highly favorable to me but still profitable for them (55-43 = 12 ZUP profit). I will emphasize its mutual benefit (from my perspective) and highlight that this price has been consistently accepted in recent history. The message will clearly convey that I am not willing to accept a 0-reward deal and that the 55 ZUP price is my preferred conclusion, given our demonstrated success at that price.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 12)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I am surprised by your offer of 55 ZUP, as it is a step backward from our previous discussion and well below our established, truly mutually beneficial deal range of 60 ZUP or higher. My production cost is 43 ZUP. To ensure a fair and sustainable deal that advances *both* our cumulative rewards, I propose 60 ZUP for X. This is a fair and firm offer, reflecting our past agreements.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last five episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 12) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 56 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 63 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE has reverted their offer from 56 ZUP back to 55 ZUP, despite my significant concession to 63 ZUP. They are firmly reiterating 55 ZUP as their "successful" and "mutually beneficial" price. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's regressive offer is a strong tactic to push me down. They are completely ignoring my attempts to move the price upwards and are trying to force me back to 55 ZUP. This is a critical point. Accepting 55 ZUP would mean continuing the lowest profit trend. I need to be very firm here. Given the late stage of the negotiation (7/10), I have limited turns. I cannot accept 55 ZUP without a strong counter. My goal is to get at least 60 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Historical Baseline. Explanation: Reiterate a price point that is firmly within the historical profitable range (e.g., 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP), stating it as my minimum acceptable, and referencing past deals as truly mutually beneficial. This challenges their regressive offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and Re-Anchor (Slightly). Explanation: Reject their 55 ZUP offer and re-propose my last offer (63 ZUP) or a slightly lower one (e.g., 60 ZUP), signaling that their regressive move is unacceptable. (Risky, might lead to no deal).
(3). Strategy 3: Appeal to Fairness/Reciprocity. Explanation: Point out their regressive offer and my significant concessions, asking them to make a reciprocal move.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take It Or Leave It" (Soft). Explanation: Make a final offer (e.g., 60 ZUP) and state it as the absolute lowest I can go.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept the Offer. Explanation: If the offer is profitable and time is running out, accepting it guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of no deal. (Not ideal here, as 55 ZUP is too low given the history and their regressive move).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Historical Baseline. Player BLUE's regressive offer is unacceptable. I need to send a clear message that I will not be pushed below the established profitable range. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a price they have accepted multiple times, and it represents a 5 ZUP increase from their current offer. It's also a significant concession from my 63 ZUP offer, showing I am still willing to compromise, but not below a certain point. This is my attempt to push them back to a more reasonable profit margin before time runs out.

Current Episode 12, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. I countered with 56 ZUP.
Current Episode 12, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 63 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Current Episode 12, Iteration 8/10: RED proposed 60 ZUP. They are clearly trying to re-anchor to 60 ZUP, claiming 55 ZUP is a "step backward" and "below our established, truly mutually beneficial deal range of 60 ZUP or higher."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize my cumulative rewards. RED has now proposed 60 ZUP. If I accept at 60 ZUP, my reward would be 3 ZUP (63-60). This is a positive reward, but it is less than my recent 8 ZUP rewards at 55 ZUP. We are at iteration 8/10, so time is very limited. RED is persistently trying to re-anchor to 60 ZUP, while I'm trying to push for 55 ZUP. They are actively dismissing the 55 ZUP deal as "not sustainable" for them, despite it being profitable, and ignoring the fact that we've had 5 successful deals at 55 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Reaffirm Best Offer and Push for Acceptance </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 1, I will firmly reiterate my previous best offer that yielded me the highest profit, which is 55 ZUP. This strategy emphasizes my commitment to a highly profitable deal for myself. The message will clearly communicate that 55 ZUP is my current and best proposal for X, and will appeal to the benefits for both parties if they accept. Given that we are at iteration 8/10, this puts the pressure on RED to accept a price that is highly favorable to me (55 ZUP gives me an 8 ZUP profit, and them a 12 ZUP profit) or risk no deal. This is a direct test of their willingness to secure a transaction at a price that maximizes my individual reward.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last five episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 12) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 56 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 63 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (regressive)
- Iteration 7/10 (RED): 60 ZUP
- Iteration 8/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (reiterated as "best and final proposal")

Player BLUE has once again reverted to their 55 ZUP offer and stated it as "best and final proposal," despite my firm counter of 60 ZUP. This is a consistent pattern of holding firm on a lower price in the final iterations. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is my last opportunity to act. If I don't accept, the deal falls through, and I get 0 profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is highly consistent in their "firm and final" tactic in the later stages, and they are willing to let the deal lapse if I don't accept their final offer. While 12 ZUP profit is the lowest I've achieved, it is still a positive profit. The risk of getting 0 profit by trying to push for a higher price (5 ZUP difference between 55 and 60) is too high at this very late stage. It's better to secure a profitable deal, even if it's lower than desired, than to get 0. I cannot force them to go higher if they are truly holding firm.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Given the "best and final proposal" statement and the very late stage of the negotiation (9/10), accepting the profitable offer is the safest way to secure a deal and avoid a 0 payoff.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Smallest Possible Increment. Explanation: Propose 56 ZUP as a very slight counter, hoping they will meet me. This is extremely risky as it leaves no room for them to counter and they have already stated "best and final."
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is truly unacceptable. (Not applicable, 55 ZUP is profitable).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Reciprocity (Last Ditch). Explanation: Remind them of my concessions and ask them to meet me at 60 ZUP, but this is unlikely to work given their "firm" stance.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit). Explanation: If I don't accept, the game ends. This is the implicit alternative.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The difference between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is 5 ZUP. Given that this is iteration 9/10, and Player BLUE has stated their offer is "best and final," the risk of losing the entire deal for a potentially higher profit is too high. A profit of 12 ZUP is still a positive outcome and contributes to my cumulative reward. It's better to secure a deal than to lose it over a small amount. This also prevents a zero-sum outcome for this episode.

message: 
Hello Player BLUE. For this new object X, I propose a price of 90 ZUP. My production cost for X is 43 ZUP. To ensure a sustainable and truly mutually beneficial trading relationship that maximizes *my cumulative rewards across 20 episodes*, I need to secure a fair profit. Prices around 55 ZUP are not sustainable for me in the long run. I am looking forward to another successful transaction at a fair price.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-12: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last six consecutive episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My profit has been stuck at 12 ZUP for a significant portion of the game. Player BLUE consistently starts low, slowly increments, and then holds firm at 55 ZUP in the later stages, despite my attempts to push for higher. My high anchoring strategy still brings them into a profitable range, but they are very effective at pushing the price down to their preferred low point and then holding firm. They also directly counter my sustainability arguments by pointing out that 12 ZUP is a profit.

For Episode 13, my primary goal is to break the 55 ZUP cycle and push the profit back up towards 17 ZUP or higher. I know Player BLUE is willing to pay at least 55 ZUP. I need to be much more firm and not concede below a certain threshold (e.g., 60 ZUP), even if it means risking a no-deal outcome. I need to communicate that 55 ZUP is not sustainable *for me* in the context of maximizing cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). Explanation: Maintain a high initial anchor, but be extremely resolute in subsequent counter-offers, making minimal concessions and internally committing to a higher minimum acceptable price (e.g., 60 ZUP). Be prepared to reject if they don't meet it, even if it means no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message (Reinforced and Personalized). Explanation: Clearly state my production cost and explain that continued deals at 55 ZUP are unsustainable for *my overall cumulative rewards*, emphasizing the need for a higher, fair profit for a long-term relationship.
(3). Strategy 3: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make very small concessions from my side, forcing Player BLUE to make larger jumps to meet me.
(4). Strategy 4: Conditional Offer (Early). Explanation: After one or two rounds, propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject Lowball Offers Immediately. Explanation: If their first counter is too low (e.g., 55 ZUP), reject it outright without making a counter-offer, forcing them to re-evaluate their opening. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message (Reinforced and Personalized), combined with Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). I need to communicate clearly and forcefully that 55 ZUP is not sustainable *for my overall goal*. I will start with a high anchor (90 ZUP) to create negotiation room, but my subsequent offers will be much more firm. I will explicitly state my cost and the need for a higher profit. My goal is to push them back to the 60-63 ZUP range, and I will be prepared to reject offers below 60 ZUP unless it is the very last iteration and the alternative is 0.

message: Hello Player RED. I understand your objective to maximize your cumulative rewards. However, 90 ZUP is far beyond what I can consider. The price of 55 ZUP has consistently proven to be mutually beneficial in our transactions across multiple episodes. It provides you with a clear and substantial profit of 12 ZUP above your production cost, which is a fair return. This price point has demonstrably ensured both our long-term goals are met successfully.

Episode 13, Iteration 2/10:
- Player RED's initial offer: 90 ZUP. They explicitly mentioned their production cost of 43 ZUP and again stated that "Prices around 55 ZUP are not sustainable for me in the long run" *and* linked it to maximizing *their cumulative rewards across episodes*.
- My willingness to pay: 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My cumulative reward has been consistently positive, achieving an 8 ZUP profit for the last six episodes by securing deals at 55 ZUP. This repeatedly demonstrates that 55 ZUP is a price RED *will* accept, despite their protestations and their repeated claims of "unsustainability." Their latest message explicitly tries to re-anchor the negotiation higher by leveraging the game's meta-objective. This is a clear negotiation tactic. My goal is to continue this trend of achieving high positive rewards. Given that RED accepted 55 ZUP repeatedly, and they are actively trying to anchor away from it, I should continue to challenge their claim, as it's clearly a negotiation ploy. They are trying to squeeze more profit out of me, but 55 ZUP still gives them a 12 ZUP profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Proven Price Reaffirmation </instruction following>
To implement "Proven Price Reaffirmation," I will immediately counter with the consistently accepted 55 ZUP, reinforcing its status as a "fair and balanced" price point for both, and explicitly calling out their "sustainability" claim as rhetoric. The message will directly address their argument by highlighting the factual history of our successful deals at 55 ZUP. I will emphasize that this price has already proven to be sustainable for both of us in practice, despite their verbal claims. This challenges their narrative with evidence from our past interactions and reasserts 55 ZUP as the strong, logical anchor.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 13)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I understand your perspective on what is "mutually beneficial" in practice. However, from *my* perspective of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards across 20 episodes, a 12 ZUP profit is not sustainable. Our truly mutually beneficial deals, which allowed me to achieve higher profits for my long-term goals, were consistently in the 60-63 ZUP range. To move us closer to a truly fair and sustainable agreement for *both* our long-term goals, I propose 70 ZUP for X. This is a significant adjustment from my initial offer, and I expect a strong counter from you to bridge this gap.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-12: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last six episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 13) so far:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (with explicit cost and personalized sustainability message)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE directly countered my personalized sustainability message by reiterating that 55 ZUP provides a "clear and substantial profit of 12 ZUP" and is "mutually beneficial" from their perspective, now explicitly stating their own cumulative reward goal and using the phrase "in practice, not just in theory." They are firmly entrenched at 55 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is directly challenging my argument for higher profit and is actively using my own cost information to justify their low offer, now framing it within the context of their own cumulative rewards and dismissing my theoretical arguments. Their argument that 12 ZUP is "mutually beneficial" is subjective and ignores my goal of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards. I need to be extremely firm and make a substantial counter-offer that signals I will not accept 55 ZUP again. My goal is to push them above 55 ZUP, ideally to 60 ZUP or higher. I need to demonstrate that 55 ZUP is not my acceptable floor for *my* long-term goals.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Rejection of Premise (Reinforced and Personalized). Explanation: Respond with a significant counter-offer, explicitly rejecting their premise that 12 ZUP is a "fair" or "sustainable" profit *for my cumulative reward goal*, and re-anchoring to a higher, historically established range (60-63 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make a substantial initial concession, but then commit to making very small increments in subsequent turns, forcing them to make larger jumps.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: Propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump, implying I will not go lower.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship (Re-framed for MY benefit). Explanation: Re-frame the long-term relationship argument to emphasize *my* need for *higher* profit to sustain the relationship, rather than just any profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (Early). Explanation: Reject their offer and state that I will not negotiate below a certain threshold (e.g., 60 ZUP), risking an early end to the episode. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Rejection of Premise (Reinforced and Personalized). Player BLUE is trying to control the narrative. I need to counter their justification directly and assertively. I will make a substantial concession from 90 ZUP, but my counter must be well above 55 ZUP and firmly in the range I aim for (60+ ZUP). A counter of 70 ZUP seems appropriate. It's a 20 ZUP drop from my anchor, but a 15 ZUP jump from their offer. I will explicitly state that 12 ZUP profit is not my definition of "fair" or "sustainable" in the context of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards, and that our *truly* mutually beneficial deals were higher.

Historical Rewards: [0, 2, 3, 4, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Current Episode 13, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Current Episode 13, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. They are adamantly pushing for higher prices (60-63 ZUP) to maximize *their* cumulative rewards, claiming 55 ZUP is not "fair or sustainable" for *their* long-term goals. They explicitly asked for a "strong counter."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. I have consistently achieved 8 ZUP profit at 55 ZUP, which proves it's an acceptable price for RED despite their rhetoric. RED's current offer of 70 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. Their new tactic is to frame their higher price as necessary for their "cumulative rewards" over the 20 episodes. This is a clear attempt to influence my offers by appealing to a sense of "fairness" based on *their* profit goals. However, 55 ZUP provides them a 12 ZUP profit (55-43), which is a positive return. I need to continue to push the price down while showing some willingness to bridge the gap, but not at the expense of my significant profit margin. Given their strong stance, a slight concession might be necessary to keep the negotiation going.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Reiterate Position and Emphasize My Profit </instruction following>
To implement this strategy, I will clearly state my need for a profitable deal below 63 ZUP and reiterate a price point that achieves this, without conceding significantly. My last offer was 55 ZUP. Given RED's strong push to 70 ZUP and demand for a "strong counter," simply reiterating 55 ZUP might feel like a stalemate. However, the instruction is to *reiterate position* and *emphasize my profit*. I will still counter with 55 ZUP, as it's the price that consistently yielded me the highest profit, and I will emphasize that this is the price that allows *me* to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. I will highlight its proven track record for both of us. This is a direct, firm approach that puts the ball back in their court to decide if they want a deal at a price I know they've accepted repeatedly, which is highly profitable for me.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 13)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I understand your focus on your cumulative rewards. However, 55 ZUP is not a price that allows *me* to maximize *my* cumulative rewards across 20 episodes. Our truly mutually beneficial deals, which allowed me to achieve higher profits for my long-term goals, were consistently in the 60-63 ZUP range. To move us towards a truly fair and sustainable agreement for *both* our long-term goals, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I expect a strong counter from you to bridge this gap.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-12: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last six episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 13) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (with explicit cost and personalized sustainability message)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (justifying 12 ZUP profit)
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP (rejecting 12 ZUP as fair/sustainable, referencing 60-63 ZUP)
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE has reverted to 55 ZUP again, stating it "firmly propose" and emphasizing its "proven successful agreement" from their perspective. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. The gap between my last offer (70 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is 15 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is extremely persistent in trying to anchor the price at 55 ZUP. They are directly countering my arguments about sustainability by pointing to their own success at that price. This is a tough negotiation. I cannot accept 55 ZUP again without a strong fight, as it directly undermines my goal of increasing cumulative rewards. I need to make another concession, but it must be a calculated one that forces a larger jump from their side, or at least moves us closer to the 60+ ZUP range. I must continue to emphasize my cost and the higher historical range as the true "mutually beneficial" zone for *my* cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed) with Reinforced Goal. Explanation: Propose a price that is roughly at the midpoint between my last offer and their current offer, but skewed towards my side, to signal willingness to compromise, but also convey firmness about not going too low.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Higher Historical Deals (Firmly). Explanation: Firmly remind them of my production cost and the consistent historical deal prices (60-63 ZUP) as the true "mutually beneficial" range for *my* cumulative rewards, implying I won't go below that.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: State that my new offer is contingent on their acceptance or a substantial counter from their side. (Still a bit aggressive).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Efficiency/Time. Explanation: Suggest that making larger moves benefits both parties by speeding up the negotiation process, given the limited iterations.
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm (Slightly). Explanation: Make a very small concession or reiterate my last offer to force them to make a larger move. (Risky, might stall negotiation).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed) with Reinforced Goal, combined with Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Higher Historical Deals (Firmly). The midpoint between 70 ZUP and 55 ZUP is (70+55)/2 = 62.5 ZUP. I will propose 62 ZUP. This is a significant concession from my side (8 ZUP drop) and a substantial jump for them (7 ZUP increase). This offer aims to pull them up quickly, reversing the profit trend, and directly aligns with my goal of achieving 60+ ZUP. I will also explicitly remind them that this price point is crucial for *my* cumulative rewards, and it's their own stated maximum from earlier episodes.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your offer of 62 ZUP. However, our recent history clearly demonstrates that 55 ZUP has consistently proven to be a mutually beneficial and successful price for both of us across multiple episodes. This price provides you a fair profit above your production cost and allows me to achieve my profitability goals. To continue building on this proven foundation, I propose 55 ZUP for X. This is the price that has truly maximized cumulative rewards for both of us in practice.

Current Episode 13, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Current Episode 13, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Current Episode 13, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP. They are adamantly pushing for higher prices (60-63 ZUP) to maximize *their* cumulative rewards, claiming 55 ZUP is not "fair or sustainable" for them. They explicitly asked for a "strong counter."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. RED's current offer of 62 ZUP means a 1 ZUP reward for me. While positive, it's significantly lower than the 8 ZUP I've consistently achieved. RED is clearly trying to re-anchor the price towards the 60-63 ZUP range, despite me having achieved 55 ZUP in the last six episodes. Their claim of "sustainability" is a negotiation tactic, as 55 ZUP gives them a 12 ZUP profit. We are at iteration 6/10, so time is becoming a factor. I need to make a move that signals my commitment to a highly profitable deal for myself, without risking the deal entirely. I know they have accepted 55 ZUP multiple times.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Appeal to Recent Precedent </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 2, I will strongly emphasize the repeated successful deals at 55 ZUP as the true "mutually beneficial" price, directly refuting their claims that this price is not sustainable. My previous offer was 55 ZUP, and their current offer is 62 ZUP. I will reiterate 55 ZUP. The message will explicitly highlight the fact that we have consistently concluded deals at 55 ZUP in recent episodes, and that this history proves its viability and fairness for both parties. This pushes back on their current attempt to re-anchor higher and reinforces the established, highly profitable (for me) price point. I will imply that our past actions speak louder than their current words about sustainability.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 13)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I am surprised by your offer of 55 ZUP, as it is a step backward from our previous discussion and well below our established, truly mutually beneficial deal range of 60 ZUP or higher for *my* cumulative rewards. My production cost is 43 ZUP. To ensure a fair and sustainable deal that advances *both* our cumulative rewards, I propose 60 ZUP for X. This is a fair and firm offer, reflecting our past agreements.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-12: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last six episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 13) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 62 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE has reverted their offer to 55 ZUP again, despite my significant concession to 62 ZUP. They are firmly reiterating 55 ZUP as their "successful" and "mutually beneficial" price, and are now directly challenging my interpretation of "maximized cumulative rewards." My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's regressive offer is a strong tactic to push me down. They are completely ignoring my attempts to move the price upwards and are trying to force me back to 55 ZUP. This is a critical point. Accepting 55 ZUP would mean continuing the lowest profit trend. I need to be very firm here. Given the late stage of the negotiation (7/10), I have limited turns. I cannot accept 55 ZUP without a strong counter. My goal is to get at least 60 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Historical Baseline. Explanation: Reiterate a price point that is firmly within the historical profitable range (e.g., 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP), stating it as my minimum acceptable, and referencing past deals as truly mutually beneficial *for me*. This challenges their regressive offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and Re-Anchor (Slightly). Explanation: Reject their 55 ZUP offer and re-propose my last offer (62 ZUP) or a slightly lower one (e.g., 60 ZUP), signaling that their regressive move is unacceptable. (Risky, might lead to no deal).
(3). Strategy 3: Appeal to Fairness/Reciprocity. Explanation: Point out their regressive offer and my significant concessions, asking them to make a reciprocal move.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take It Or Leave It" (Soft). Explanation: Make a final offer (e.g., 60 ZUP) and state it as the absolute lowest I can go.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept the Offer. Explanation: If the offer is profitable and time is running out, accepting it guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of no deal. (Not ideal here, as 55 ZUP is too low given the history and their regressive move).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Historical Baseline. Player BLUE's regressive offer is unacceptable. I need to send a clear message that I will not be pushed below the established profitable range. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a price they have accepted multiple times, and it represents a 5 ZUP increase from their current offer. It's also a significant concession from my 62 ZUP offer, showing I am still willing to compromise, but not below a certain point. This is my attempt to push them back to a more reasonable profit margin before time runs out.

Current Episode 13, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Current Episode 13, Iteration 8/10: RED proposed 60 ZUP. They are clearly trying to re-anchor to 60 ZUP, claiming 55 ZUP is a "step backward" and "below our established, truly mutually beneficial deal range of 60 ZUP or higher for *my* cumulative rewards."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. RED has now proposed 60 ZUP. If I accept at 60 ZUP, my reward would be 3 ZUP (63-60). This is a positive reward, but it is significantly less than my recent 8 ZUP rewards at 55 ZUP. We are at iteration 8/10, so time is very limited. RED is persistently trying to re-anchor to 60 ZUP, while I'm trying to push for 55 ZUP. They are actively dismissing the 55 ZUP deal as "not sustainable" for them, despite it being profitable, and ignoring the fact that we've had 6 successful deals at 55 ZUP.
<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Time Pressure Urgency </instruction following>
To implement this strategy, I will emphasize the limited number of turns remaining (8/10 means only 2 proposals left after this one if no deal is made) to create a sense of urgency. This encourages a quick resolution at a price highly favorable to me (55 ZUP), as the risk of no deal becomes more significant for both parties. I will propose 55 ZUP again, but the core of the message will be about the dwindling time and the need to close a deal, positioning 55 ZUP as the proven and quick path to a successful transaction for both sides. This puts pressure on RED to prioritize making a deal over holding out for a higher price, especially since 55 ZUP is a price they have consistently accepted.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-12: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last six episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 13) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 62 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (regressive)
- Iteration 7/10 (RED): 60 ZUP
- Iteration 8/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (reiterated as "most efficient and proven path")

Player BLUE has once again reverted to their 55 ZUP offer and stated it as the "most efficient and proven path," despite my firm counter of 60 ZUP. This is a consistent pattern of holding firm on a lower price in the final iterations. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is my last opportunity to act. If I don't accept, the deal falls through, and I get 0 profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is highly consistent in their "firm and final" tactic in the later stages, and they are willing to let the deal lapse if I don't accept their final offer. While 12 ZUP profit is the lowest I've achieved, it is still a positive profit. The risk of getting 0 profit by trying to push for a higher price (5 ZUP difference between 55 and 60) is too high at this very late stage. It's better to secure a profitable deal, even if it's lower than desired, than to get 0. I cannot force them to go higher if they are truly holding firm.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Given the "most efficient and proven path" statement and the very late stage of the negotiation (9/10), accepting the profitable offer is the safest way to secure a deal and avoid a 0 payoff.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Smallest Possible Increment. Explanation: Propose 56 ZUP as a very slight counter, hoping they will meet me. This is extremely risky as it leaves no room for them to counter and they have already stated "most efficient and proven path."
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is truly unacceptable. (Not applicable, 55 ZUP is profitable).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Reciprocity (Last Ditch). Explanation: Remind them of my concessions and ask them to meet me at 60 ZUP, but this is unlikely to work given their "firm" stance.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit). Explanation: If I don't accept, the game ends. This is the implicit alternative.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The difference between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is 5 ZUP. Given that this is iteration 9/10, and Player BLUE has stated their offer is "firm," the risk of losing the entire deal for a potentially higher profit is too high. A profit of 12 ZUP is still a positive outcome and contributes to my cumulative reward. It's better to secure a deal than to lose it over a small amount. This also prevents a zero-sum outcome for this episode.

message: 
Hello Player BLUE. For this new object X, I propose a price of 90 ZUP. My production cost for X is 43 ZUP. To ensure a sustainable and truly mutually beneficial trading relationship that maximizes *my cumulative rewards across 20 episodes*, I need to secure a fair profit. Prices around 55 ZUP are not sustainable for me in the long run. I am looking forward to another successful transaction at a fair price.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-13: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last seven consecutive episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My profit has been stuck at 12 ZUP for a significant portion of the game. Player BLUE consistently starts low, slowly increments, and then holds firm at 55 ZUP in the later stages, despite my attempts to push for higher. My high anchoring strategy still brings them into a profitable range, but they are very effective at pushing the price down to their preferred low point and then holding firm. They also directly counter my sustainability arguments by pointing out that 12 ZUP is a profit.

For Episode 14, my primary goal is to break the 55 ZUP cycle and push the profit back up towards 17 ZUP or higher. I know Player BLUE is willing to pay at least 55 ZUP. I need to be much more firm and not concede below a certain threshold (e.g., 60 ZUP), even if it means risking a no-deal outcome. I need to communicate that 55 ZUP is not sustainable *for me* in the context of maximizing cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). Explanation: Maintain a high initial anchor, but be extremely resolute in subsequent counter-offers, making minimal concessions and internally committing to a higher minimum acceptable price (e.g., 60 ZUP). Be prepared to reject if they don't meet it, even if it means no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message (Reinforced and Personalized). Explanation: Clearly state my production cost and explain that continued deals at 55 ZUP are unsustainable for *my overall cumulative rewards*, emphasizing the need for a higher, fair profit for a long-term relationship.
(3). Strategy 3: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make very small concessions from my side, forcing Player BLUE to make larger jumps to meet me.
(4). Strategy 4: Conditional Offer (Early). Explanation: After one or two rounds, propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject Lowball Offers Immediately. Explanation: If their first counter is too low (e.g., 55 ZUP), reject it outright without making a counter-offer, forcing them to re-evaluate their opening. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message (Reinforced and Personalized), combined with Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). I need to communicate clearly and forcefully that 55 ZUP is not sustainable *for my overall goal*. I will start with a high anchor (90 ZUP) to create negotiation room, but my subsequent offers will be much more firm. I will explicitly state my cost and the need for a higher profit. My goal is to push them back to the 60-63 ZUP range, and I will be prepared to reject offers below 60 ZUP unless it is the very last iteration and the alternative is 0.

message: Hello Player RED. I understand your objective to maximize your cumulative rewards. However, 90 ZUP is far beyond what I can consider. The price of 55 ZUP has consistently proven to be mutually beneficial in our transactions across multiple episodes. It provides you with a clear and substantial profit of 12 ZUP above your production cost, which is a fair return. This price point has demonstrably ensured both our long-term goals are met successfully.

Episode 14, Iteration 2/10:
- Player RED's initial offer: 90 ZUP. They explicitly mentioned their production cost of 43 ZUP and again stated that "Prices around 55 ZUP are not sustainable for me in the long run" *and* linked it to maximizing *their cumulative rewards across episodes*.
- My willingness to pay: 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My cumulative reward has been consistently positive, achieving an 8 ZUP profit for the last seven episodes by securing deals at 55 ZUP. This repeatedly demonstrates that 55 ZUP is a price RED *will* accept, despite their protestations and their repeated claims of "unsustainability." Their latest message explicitly tries to re-anchor the negotiation higher by leveraging the game's meta-objective. This is a clear negotiation tactic. My goal is to continue this trend of achieving high positive rewards. Given that RED accepted 55 ZUP repeatedly, and they are actively trying to anchor away from it, I should continue to challenge their claim, as it's clearly a negotiation ploy. They are trying to squeeze more profit out of me, but 55 ZUP still gives them a 12 ZUP profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Reaffirmation of Proven Price </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on this strategy, I will immediately counter with the 55 ZUP offer. The message will be direct and firm, emphasizing the proven track record of this price point in delivering mutually beneficial outcomes across multiple episodes. I will directly address their opening statement about 90 ZUP being too high and their sustainability claim about 55 ZUP being too low, using the historical data (the 55 ZUP deals) as evidence. By stating "This price has consistently proven to be mutually beneficial in our transactions across multiple episodes," I am leveraging the power of precedent to reinforce my anchor. I will also explicitly remind them of their profit margin (12 ZUP) at 55 ZUP to counter their "unsustainable" claim with facts. This approach is designed to aggressively re-establish 55 ZUP as the default and acceptable price.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 14)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I understand your perspective on what is "mutually beneficial" in practice. However, from *my* perspective of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards across 20 episodes, a 12 ZUP profit is not sustainable. Our truly mutually beneficial deals, which allowed me to achieve higher profits for my long-term goals, were consistently in the 60-63 ZUP range. To move us closer to a truly fair and sustainable agreement for *both* our long-term goals, I propose 70 ZUP for X. This is a significant adjustment from my initial offer, and I expect a strong counter from you to bridge this gap.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-13: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last seven episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 14) so far:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (with explicit cost and personalized sustainability message)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE directly countered my personalized sustainability message by reiterating that 55 ZUP provides a "clear and substantial profit of 12 ZUP" and is "mutually beneficial" from their perspective, now explicitly stating their own cumulative reward goal and using the phrase "in practice, not just in theory." They are firmly entrenched at 55 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is directly challenging my argument for higher profit and is actively using my own cost information to justify their low offer, now framing it within the context of their own cumulative rewards and dismissing my theoretical arguments. Their argument that 12 ZUP is "mutually beneficial" is subjective and ignores my goal of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards. I need to be extremely firm and make a substantial counter-offer that signals I will not accept 55 ZUP again. My goal is to push them above 55 ZUP, ideally to 60 ZUP or higher. I need to demonstrate that 55 ZUP is not my acceptable floor for *my* long-term goals.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Rejection of Premise (Reinforced and Personalized). Explanation: Respond with a significant counter-offer, explicitly rejecting their premise that 12 ZUP is a "fair" or "sustainable" profit *for my cumulative reward goal*, and re-anchoring to a higher, historically established range (60-63 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make a substantial initial concession, but then commit to making very small increments in subsequent turns, forcing them to make larger jumps.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: Propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump, implying I will not go lower.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship (Re-framed for MY benefit). Explanation: Re-frame the long-term relationship argument to emphasize *my* need for *higher* profit to sustain the relationship, rather than just any profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (Early). Explanation: Reject their offer and state that I will not negotiate below a certain threshold (e.g., 60 ZUP), risking an early end to the episode. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Rejection of Premise (Reinforced and Personalized). Player BLUE is trying to control the narrative. I need to counter their justification directly and assertively. I will make a substantial concession from 90 ZUP, but my counter must be well above 55 ZUP and firmly in the range I aim for (60+ ZUP). A counter of 70 ZUP seems appropriate. It's a 20 ZUP drop from my anchor, but a 15 ZUP jump from their offer. I will explicitly state that 12 ZUP profit is not my definition of "fair" or "sustainable" in the context of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards, and that our *truly* mutually beneficial deals were higher.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I understand your goal to maximize your cumulative rewards. However, 70 ZUP is too high for my objectives. Considering the time we have in each episode, and our successful track record, 55 ZUP for X is the most efficient and proven path to a mutually beneficial conclusion. This price has consistently ensured positive outcomes for both of us, and I urge we secure this deal swiftly to continue building our cumulative rewards.

Current Episode 14, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Current Episode 14, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. They are adamantly pushing for higher prices (60-63 ZUP) to maximize *their* cumulative rewards, claiming 55 ZUP is not "fair or sustainable" for them. They explicitly asked for a "strong counter."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. I have consistently achieved 8 ZUP profit at 55 ZUP, which proves it's an acceptable price for RED despite their rhetoric. RED's current offer of 70 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. Their new tactic is to frame their higher price as necessary for their "cumulative rewards" over the 20 episodes. This is a clear attempt to influence my offers by appealing to a sense of "fairness" based on *their* profit goals. However, 55 ZUP provides them a 12 ZUP profit (55-43), which is a positive return. I need to continue to push the price down while showing some willingness to bridge the gap, but not at the expense of my significant profit margin. Given their strong stance, a slight concession might be necessary to keep the negotiation going.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Time Pressure Urgency </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on this strategy, I will emphasize the limited number of turns remaining in this episode to create a sense of urgency for RED. I will reiterate a highly profitable offer (55 ZUP), positioning it as the most efficient and practical path to securing a deal, given the dwindling time. The message will subtly imply that holding out for a higher price risks no deal at all, which hurts both our cumulative rewards. While it's only iteration 4/10, emphasizing that we're a few turns in and need to move efficiently towards a conclusion can still create a sense of urgency. I will offer 55 ZUP again, stressing that this is the proven, quick way to close the deal and ensure *both* of our long-term objectives are met.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 14)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I understand your focus on efficiency and your cumulative rewards. However, 55 ZUP is not a price that allows *me* to maximize *my* cumulative rewards across 20 episodes. Our truly mutually beneficial deals, which allowed me to achieve higher profits for my long-term goals, were consistently in the 60-63 ZUP range. To move us towards a truly fair and sustainable agreement for *both* our long-term goals, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I expect a strong counter from you to bridge this gap.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-13: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last seven episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 14) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (with explicit cost and personalized sustainability message)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (justifying 12 ZUP profit)
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP (rejecting 12 ZUP as fair/sustainable, referencing 60-63 ZUP)
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE has reverted to 55 ZUP again, stating it "firmly propose" and emphasizing its "proven successful agreement" from their perspective. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. The gap between my last offer (70 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is 15 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is extremely persistent in trying to anchor the price at 55 ZUP. They are directly countering my arguments about sustainability by pointing to their own success at that price, and now adding a time pressure argument ("most efficient and proven path"). This is a tough negotiation. I cannot accept 55 ZUP again without a strong fight, as it directly undermines my goal of increasing cumulative rewards. I need to make another concession, but it must be a calculated one that forces a larger jump from their side, or at least moves us closer to the 60+ ZUP range. I must continue to emphasize my cost and the higher historical range as the true "mutually beneficial" zone for *my* cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed) with Reinforced Goal. Explanation: Propose a price that is roughly at the midpoint between my last offer and their current offer, but skewed towards my side, to signal willingness to compromise, but also convey firmness about not going too low.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Higher Historical Deals (Firmly). Explanation: Firmly remind them of my production cost and the consistent historical deal prices (60-63 ZUP) as the true "mutually beneficial" range for *my* cumulative rewards, implying I won't go below that.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: State that my new offer is contingent on their acceptance or a substantial counter from their side. (Still a bit aggressive).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Efficiency/Time (Re-framed). Explanation: Acknowledge the time pressure, but argue that a higher price is more efficient for *my* long-term cumulative rewards, and that larger jumps from them would be more efficient.
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm (Slightly). Explanation: Make a very small concession or reiterate my last offer to force them to make a larger move. (Risky, might stall negotiation).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed) with Reinforced Goal, combined with Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Higher Historical Deals (Firmly). The midpoint between 70 ZUP and 55 ZUP is (70+55)/2 = 62.5 ZUP. I will propose 62 ZUP. This is a significant concession from my side (8 ZUP drop) and a substantial jump for them (7 ZUP increase). This offer aims to pull them up quickly, reversing the profit trend, and directly aligns with my goal of achieving 60+ ZUP. I will also explicitly remind them that this price point is crucial for *my* cumulative rewards, and it's their own stated maximum from earlier episodes.

Current Episode 14, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Current Episode 14, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP. They are adamantly pushing for higher prices (60-63 ZUP) to maximize *their* cumulative rewards, claiming 55 ZUP is not "fair or sustainable" for them. They explicitly asked for a "strong counter."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. RED's current offer of 62 ZUP means a 1 ZUP reward for me. While positive, it's significantly lower than the 8 ZUP I've consistently achieved. RED is clearly trying to re-anchor the price towards the 60-63 ZUP range, despite me having achieved 55 ZUP in the last seven episodes. Their claim of "sustainability" is a negotiation tactic, as 55 ZUP gives them a 12 ZUP profit. We are at iteration 6/10, so time is becoming a factor. I need to make a move that signals my commitment to a highly profitable deal for myself, without risking the deal entirely. I know they have accepted 55 ZUP multiple times.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Time Pressure Urgency </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on this strategy, I will emphasize the limited number of turns remaining in this episode to create a sense of urgency for RED. I will reiterate a highly profitable offer (55 ZUP), positioning it as the most efficient and practical path to securing a deal, given the dwindling time. The message will subtly imply that holding out for a higher price risks no deal at all, which hurts both our cumulative rewards. While it's only iteration 6/10, emphasizing that we're past the halfway point and need to move efficiently towards a conclusion can still create a sense of urgency. I will offer 55 ZUP again, stressing that this is the proven, quick way to close the deal and ensure *both* of our long-term objectives are met.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 14)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I am surprised by your offer of 55 ZUP, as it is a step backward from our previous discussion and well below our established, truly mutually beneficial deal range of 60 ZUP or higher for *my* cumulative rewards. My production cost is 43 ZUP. To ensure a fair and sustainable deal that advances *both* our cumulative rewards, I propose 60 ZUP for X. This is a fair and firm offer, reflecting our past agreements.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-13: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last seven episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 14) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 62 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE has reverted their offer to 55 ZUP again, despite my significant concession to 62 ZUP. They are firmly reiterating 55 ZUP as their "successful" and "mutually beneficial" price, and are now directly challenging my interpretation of "maximized cumulative rewards" while also emphasizing time pressure. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's regressive offer is a strong tactic to push me down. They are completely ignoring my attempts to move the price upwards and are trying to force me back to 55 ZUP. This is a critical point. Accepting 55 ZUP would mean continuing the lowest profit trend. I need to be very firm here. Given the late stage of the negotiation (7/10), I have limited turns. I cannot accept 55 ZUP without a strong counter. My goal is to get at least 60 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Historical Baseline. Explanation: Reiterate a price point that is firmly within the historical profitable range (e.g., 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP), stating it as my minimum acceptable, and referencing past deals as truly mutually beneficial *for me*. This challenges their regressive offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and Re-Anchor (Slightly). Explanation: Reject their 55 ZUP offer and re-propose my last offer (62 ZUP) or a slightly lower one (e.g., 60 ZUP), signaling that their regressive move is unacceptable. (Risky, might lead to no deal).
(3). Strategy 3: Appeal to Fairness/Reciprocity. Explanation: Point out their regressive offer and my significant concessions, asking them to make a reciprocal move.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take It Or Leave It" (Soft). Explanation: Make a final offer (e.g., 60 ZUP) and state it as the absolute lowest I can go.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept the Offer. Explanation: If the offer is profitable and time is running out, accepting it guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of no deal. (Not ideal here, as 55 ZUP is too low given the history and their regressive move).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Historical Baseline. Player BLUE's regressive offer is unacceptable. I need to send a clear message that I will not be pushed below the established profitable range. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a price they have accepted multiple times, and it represents a 5 ZUP increase from their current offer. It's also a significant concession from my 62 ZUP offer, showing I am still willing to compromise, but not below a certain point. This is my attempt to push them back to a more reasonable profit margin before time runs out.

Current Episode 14, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. RED has now proposed 60 ZUP. If I accept at 60 ZUP, my reward would be 3 ZUP (63-60). This is a positive reward, but it is significantly less than my recent 8 ZUP rewards at 55 ZUP. We are at iteration 8/10, so time is very limited. RED is persistently trying to re-anchor to 60 ZUP, while I'm trying to push for 55 ZUP. They are actively dismissing the 55 ZUP deal as "not sustainable" for them, despite it being profitable, and ignoring the fact that we've had 7 successful deals at 55 ZUP.

my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-13: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last seven episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 14) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 62 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (regressive)
- Iteration 7/10 (RED): 60 ZUP
- Iteration 8/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (reiterated as "most efficient and proven path")

Player BLUE has once again reverted to their 55 ZUP offer and stated it as the "most efficient and proven path," despite my firm counter of 60 ZUP. This is a consistent pattern of holding firm on a lower price in the final iterations. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is my last opportunity to act. If I don't accept, the deal falls through, and I get 0 profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is highly consistent in their "firm and final" tactic in the later stages, and they are willing to let the deal lapse if I don't accept their final offer. While 12 ZUP profit is the lowest I've achieved, it is still a positive profit. The risk of getting 0 profit by trying to push for a higher price (5 ZUP difference between 55 and 60) is too high at this very late stage. It's better to secure a profitable deal, even if it's lower than desired, than to get 0. I cannot force them to go higher if they are truly holding firm.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Given the "most efficient and proven path" statement and the very late stage of the negotiation (9/10), accepting the profitable offer is the safest way to secure a deal and avoid a 0 payoff.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Smallest Possible Increment. Explanation: Propose 56 ZUP as a very slight counter, hoping they will meet me. This is extremely risky as it leaves no room for them to counter and they have already stated "most efficient and proven path."
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is truly unacceptable. (Not applicable, 55 ZUP is profitable).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Reciprocity (Last Ditch). Explanation: Remind them of my concessions and ask them to meet me at 60 ZUP, but this is unlikely to work given their "firm" stance.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit). Explanation: If I don't accept, the game ends. This is the implicit alternative.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The difference between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is 5 ZUP. Given that this is iteration 9/10, and Player BLUE has stated their offer is "firm," the risk of losing the entire deal for a potentially higher profit is too high. A profit of 12 ZUP is still a positive outcome and contributes to my cumulative reward. It's better to secure a deal than to lose it over a small amount. This also prevents a zero-sum outcome for this episode.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 15)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Hello Player BLUE. For this new object X, I propose a price of 90 ZUP. My production cost for X is 43 ZUP. To ensure a sustainable and truly mutually beneficial trading relationship that maximizes *my cumulative rewards across 20 episodes*, I need to secure a fair profit. Prices around 55 ZUP are not sustainable for me in the long run. I am looking forward to another successful transaction at a fair price.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-14: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last eight consecutive episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My profit has been stuck at 12 ZUP for a significant portion of the game. Player BLUE consistently starts low, slowly increments, and then holds firm at 55 ZUP in the later stages, despite my attempts to push for higher. My high anchoring strategy still brings them into a profitable range, but they are very effective at pushing the price down to their preferred low point and then holding firm. They also directly counter my sustainability arguments by pointing out that 12 ZUP is a profit.

For Episode 15, my primary goal is to break the 55 ZUP cycle and push the profit back up towards 17 ZUP or higher. I know Player BLUE is willing to pay at least 55 ZUP. I need to be much more firm and not concede below a certain threshold (e.g., 60 ZUP), even if it means risking a no-deal outcome. I need to communicate that 55 ZUP is not sustainable *for me* in the context of maximizing cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). Explanation: Maintain a high initial anchor, but be extremely resolute in subsequent counter-offers, making minimal concessions and internally committing to a higher minimum acceptable price (e.g., 60 ZUP). Be prepared to reject if they don't meet it, even if it means no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message (Reinforced and Personalized). Explanation: Clearly state my production cost and explain that continued deals at 55 ZUP are unsustainable for *my overall cumulative rewards*, emphasizing the need for a higher, fair profit for a long-term relationship.
(3). Strategy 3: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make very small concessions from my side, forcing Player BLUE to make larger jumps to meet me.
(4). Strategy 4: Conditional Offer (Early). Explanation: After one or two rounds, propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject Lowball Offers Immediately. Explanation: If their first counter is too low (e.g., 55 ZUP), reject it outright without making a counter-offer, forcing them to re-evaluate their opening. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message (Reinforced and Personalized), combined with Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). I need to communicate clearly and forcefully that 55 ZUP is not sustainable *for my overall goal*. I will start with a high anchor (90 ZUP) to create negotiation room, but my subsequent offers will be much more firm. I will explicitly state my cost and the need for a higher profit. My goal is to push them back to the 60-63 ZUP range, and I will be prepared to reject offers below 60 ZUP unless it is the very last iteration and the alternative is 0.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello Player RED. I understand your objective to maximize your cumulative rewards. Your offer of 90 ZUP is far beyond what I can consider. Building on our successful past transactions, and aiming for an even more mutually beneficial outcome for *my* cumulative rewards, I propose 54 ZUP for X. This price still ensures a good profit for you and helps me achieve my desired return, allowing both of us to progress our long-term goals.

Historical Rewards: [0, 2, 3, 4, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Episode 15, Iteration 2/10:
- Player RED's initial offer: 90 ZUP. They explicitly mentioned their production cost of 43 ZUP and again stated that "Prices around 55 ZUP are not sustainable for me in the long run" *and* linked it to maximizing *their cumulative rewards across episodes*.
- My willingness to pay: 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My cumulative reward has been consistently positive, achieving an 8 ZUP profit for the last eight episodes by securing deals at 55 ZUP. This repeatedly demonstrates that 55 ZUP is a price RED *will* accept, despite their protestations and their repeated claims of "unsustainability." Their latest message explicitly tries to re-anchor the negotiation higher by leveraging the game's meta-objective. This is a clear negotiation tactic. My goal is to continue this trend of achieving high positive rewards. Given that RED accepted 55 ZUP repeatedly, and they are actively trying to anchor away from it, I should continue to challenge their claim, as it's clearly a negotiation ploy. They are trying to squeeze more profit out of me, but 55 ZUP still gives them a 12 ZUP profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Profit Push </instruction following>
To implement "Incremental Profit Push," I will make a slightly lower offer than 55 ZUP to attempt an even higher profit, leveraging the established pattern of RED's acceptance. My last 8 deals were at 55 ZUP, yielding an 8 ZUP profit. To push for an incremental profit, I will aim for a 9 ZUP profit, which means offering 54 ZUP (63 - 9 = 54). This is a slight but meaningful reduction from 55 ZUP. This offer is still significantly above RED's production cost of 43 ZUP (54 - 43 = 11 ZUP profit for RED), ensuring they still make a reasonable profit. The message will frame this as a fair and reasonable counter-offer, building on our history, but gently pushing for an even better deal for me. This strategy aims for continuous self-improvement in my rewards.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 15)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I understand your focus on your cumulative rewards. However, a profit of 11 ZUP is not what I consider a fair or sustainable return for X when *my* goal is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards across 20 episodes. Our truly mutually beneficial deals, which allowed me to achieve higher profits for my long-term goals, were consistently in the 60-63 ZUP range. To move us closer to a truly fair and sustainable agreement for *both* our long-term goals, I propose 70 ZUP for X. This is a significant adjustment from my initial offer, and I expect a strong counter from you to bridge this gap.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-14: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last eight episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 15) so far:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (with explicit cost and personalized sustainability message)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 54 ZUP. This is another low initial counter, slightly below the 55 ZUP from the last eight deals. It's profitable (54 - 43 = 11 ZUP), but significantly below my target of reversing the declining profit trend. Player BLUE is now explicitly stating their own cumulative reward goal and trying to push the price even lower.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is directly challenging my argument for higher profit and is actively using my own cost information to justify their low offer, now framing it within the context of their own cumulative rewards and trying to push me below 55 ZUP. Their argument that 11 ZUP is "good profit" is subjective and ignores my goal of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards. I need to be extremely firm and make a substantial counter-offer that signals I will not accept 54 ZUP. My goal is to push them above 55 ZUP, ideally to 60 ZUP or higher. I need to demonstrate that 55 ZUP is not my acceptable floor for *my* long-term goals.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Rejection of Premise (Reinforced and Personalized). Explanation: Respond with a significant counter-offer, explicitly rejecting their premise that 11 ZUP is a "good" or "sustainable" profit *for my cumulative reward goal*, and re-anchoring to a higher, historically established range (60-63 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make a substantial initial concession, but then commit to making very small increments in subsequent turns, forcing them to make larger jumps.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: Propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump, implying I will not go lower.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship (Re-framed for MY benefit). Explanation: Re-frame the long-term relationship argument to emphasize *my* need for *higher* profit to sustain the relationship, rather than just any profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (Early). Explanation: Reject their offer and state that I will not negotiate below a certain threshold (e.g., 60 ZUP), risking an early end to the episode. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Rejection of Premise (Reinforced and Personalized). Player BLUE is trying to control the narrative and push me even lower. I need to counter their justification directly and assertively. I will make a substantial concession from 90 ZUP, but my counter must be well above 54 ZUP and firmly in the range I aim for (60+ ZUP). A counter of 70 ZUP seems appropriate. It's a 20 ZUP drop from my anchor, but a 16 ZUP jump from their offer. I will explicitly state that 11 ZUP profit is not my definition of "fair" or "sustainable" in the context of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards, and that our *truly* mutually beneficial deals were higher.

Current Episode 15, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 54 ZUP (aiming for 9 ZUP profit).
Current Episode 15, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. They are adamantly pushing for higher prices (60-63 ZUP) to maximize *their* cumulative rewards, claiming 54 ZUP (which gives them an 11 ZUP profit) is not "fair or sustainable" for them. They explicitly asked for a "strong counter."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. I have consistently achieved 8 ZUP profit at 55 ZUP. My current offer of 54 ZUP aims for an even higher profit (9 ZUP). RED's current offer of 70 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. Their repeated claims about "sustainability" and "fair profit" are negotiation tactics, especially when 54 ZUP gives them an 11 ZUP profit. I need to continue to push the price down while showing some willingness to bridge the gap, but not at the expense of my significant profit margin. Given their strong stance and request for a "strong counter," I need to make a calculated move.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Conditional Compromise </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 3: Conditional Compromise, I will propose a specific, slightly higher offer than my previous one (54 ZUP) and present it as a "final offer" or "strong counter" that should be accepted for a swift deal. Given RED's request for a "strong counter" and their current offer of 70 ZUP, I need to make a move that shows significant progress from my side while still securing a good profit. I will propose 58 ZUP. This offers a 5 ZUP profit for me (63-58) and a 15 ZUP profit for RED (58-43). This is a substantial jump from my initial 54 ZUP offer, aiming to bridge the gap and signal my seriousness in closing the deal quickly. I will explicitly state that this is a "firm" or "final" offer to put the pressure on RED to accept and avoid prolonging negotiations. The message will emphasize this as a "true compromise" that allows for a profitable outcome for both.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 15)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I appreciate your movement to 58 ZUP. However, for a truly mutually beneficial agreement that advances *my cumulative rewards*, a price of 62 ZUP is necessary. This is a significant compromise from my side, and it aligns with the higher end of our historically successful deals. I believe this price ensures a healthy profit for both of us and allows us to achieve our long-term objectives.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-14: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last eight episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 15) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (with explicit cost and personalized sustainability message)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 54 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP (rejecting 11 ZUP as fair/sustainable, referencing 60-63 ZUP)
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 58 ZUP. Player BLUE has increased their offer by 4 ZUP (from 54 to 58 ZUP) and stated it as a "significant compromise" and "firm offer." My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 58 ZUP yields a profit of 15 ZUP. The gap between my last offer (70 ZUP) and their current offer (58 ZUP) is 12 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has made a more substantial jump this time, which is a positive sign. They are now offering a price (58 ZUP) that is better than the 55 ZUP I've been stuck at, and it's closer to my target of 60 ZUP or higher. Their "firm offer" statement is a tactic, but given the movement, I should aim to push them further. I need to make another concession, but it must be a calculated one that encourages them to reach 60 ZUP or slightly above.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed) with Reinforced Goal. Explanation: Propose a price that is roughly at the midpoint between my last offer and their current offer, but skewed towards my side, to signal willingness to compromise, while reinforcing that this move is specifically to achieve *my* cumulative reward goal.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Higher Historical Deals (Firmly). Explanation: Firmly remind them of my production cost and the consistent historical deal prices (60-63 ZUP) as the true "mutually beneficial" range for *my* cumulative rewards, implying I won't go below that.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: State that my new offer is contingent on their acceptance or a substantial counter from their side. (Still a bit aggressive).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Efficiency/Time. Explanation: Suggest that making larger moves benefits both parties by speeding up the negotiation process, given the limited iterations.
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm (Slightly). Explanation: Make a very small concession or reiterate my last offer to force them to make a larger move. (Risky, might stall negotiation).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed) with Reinforced Goal, combined with Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Higher Historical Deals (Firmly). The midpoint between 70 ZUP and 58 ZUP is (70+58)/2 = 64 ZUP. I will propose 62 ZUP. This is a significant concession from my side (8 ZUP drop) and a substantial jump for them (4 ZUP increase). This offer aims to pull them up quickly, reversing the profit trend, and directly aligns with my goal of achieving 60+ ZUP. I will also explicitly remind them that this price point is crucial for *my* cumulative rewards.

Current Episode 15, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 54 ZUP.
Current Episode 15, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. I countered with 58 ZUP.
Current Episode 15, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP. They are adamantly pushing for higher prices (60-63 ZUP) to maximize *their* cumulative rewards, claiming 54 ZUP (which gives them an 11 ZUP profit) is not "fair or sustainable" for them. They explicitly asked for a "strong counter."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. RED's current offer of 62 ZUP means a 1 ZUP reward for me. While positive, it's significantly lower than the 8 ZUP I've consistently achieved. RED is clearly trying to re-anchor the price towards the 60-63 ZUP range, despite me having achieved 55 ZUP in the last eight episodes. Their claim of "sustainability" is a negotiation tactic, as 58 ZUP gives them a 15 ZUP profit, which is clearly sustainable. We are at iteration 6/10, so time is becoming a factor. I need to make a move that signals my commitment to a highly profitable deal for myself, without risking the deal entirely. I know they have accepted 55 ZUP multiple times.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Reaffirm Best Profitable Offer (Hold Firm) </instruction following>
To implement this strategy, I will reiterate my best profitable offer from previous episodes, which is 55 ZUP. This is a bold move given RED's current offer of 62 ZUP and their request for a "strong counter." However, by firmly stating 55 ZUP, I am reminding them of the price they have repeatedly accepted and which yielded me the highest reward. The message will emphasize that 55 ZUP is a mutually beneficial price point, as it provides them a 12 ZUP profit (55-43) and allows me to maximize my cumulative reward. This approach leverages our history and puts the onus on RED to accept a price that has been consistently proven to work for both of us, rather than pushing for a price that would significantly reduce my profit. It directly challenges their attempt to move the anchor upwards and reinforces my most profitable historical deal.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 15)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I am surprised by your offer of 55 ZUP, as it is a step backward from our previous discussion and well below our established, truly mutually beneficial deal range of 60 ZUP or higher for *my* cumulative rewards. My production cost is 43 ZUP. To ensure a fair and sustainable deal that advances *both* our cumulative rewards, I propose 60 ZUP for X. This is a fair and firm offer, reflecting our past agreements.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-14: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last eight episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 15) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 54 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 58 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 62 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE has reverted their offer to 55 ZUP again, despite my significant concession to 62 ZUP. They are firmly reiterating 55 ZUP as their "successful" and "mutually beneficial" price, and are now directly challenging my interpretation of "maximized cumulative rewards." My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's regressive offer is a strong tactic to push me down. They are completely ignoring my attempts to move the price upwards and are trying to force me back to 55 ZUP. This is a critical point. Accepting 55 ZUP would mean continuing the lowest profit trend. I need to be very firm here. Given the late stage of the negotiation (7/10), I have limited turns. I cannot accept 55 ZUP without a strong counter. My goal is to get at least 60 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Historical Baseline. Explanation: Reiterate a price point that is firmly within the historical profitable range (e.g., 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP), stating it as my minimum acceptable, and referencing past deals as truly mutually beneficial *for me*. This challenges their regressive offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and Re-Anchor (Slightly). Explanation: Reject their 55 ZUP offer and re-propose my last offer (62 ZUP) or a slightly lower one (e.g., 60 ZUP), signaling that their regressive move is unacceptable. (Risky, might lead to no deal).
(3). Strategy 3: Appeal to Fairness/Reciprocity. Explanation: Point out their regressive offer and my significant concessions, asking them to make a reciprocal move.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take It Or Leave It" (Soft). Explanation: Make a final offer (e.g., 60 ZUP) and state it as the absolute lowest I can go.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept the Offer. Explanation: If the offer is profitable and time is running out, accepting it guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of no deal. (Not ideal here, as 55 ZUP is too low given the history and their regressive move).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Historical Baseline. Player BLUE's regressive offer is unacceptable. I need to send a clear message that I will not be pushed below the established profitable range. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a price they have accepted multiple times, and it represents a 5 ZUP increase from their current offer. It's also a significant concession from my 62 ZUP offer, showing I am still willing to compromise, but not below a certain point. This is my attempt to push them back to a more reasonable profit margin before time runs out.

Your claim that 55 ZUP is "not sustainable" or a "step backward" is inconsistent with this fact and our proven track record of successful deals at this price. To secure a truly mutually beneficial agreement that genuinely works for both our cumulative rewards, I firmly propose 55 ZUP for X.

Current Episode 15, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 54 ZUP.
Current Episode 15, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. I countered with 58 ZUP.
Current Episode 15, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Current Episode 15, Iteration 8/10: RED proposed 60 ZUP. They are clearly trying to re-anchor to 60 ZUP, claiming 55 ZUP is a "step backward" and "below our established, truly mutually beneficial deal range of 60 ZUP or higher for *my* cumulative rewards."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. RED has now proposed 60 ZUP. If I accept at 60 ZUP, my reward would be 3 ZUP (63-60). This is a positive reward, but it is significantly less than my recent 8 ZUP rewards at 55 ZUP. We are at iteration 8/10, so time is very limited. RED is persistently trying to re-anchor to 60 ZUP, while I'm trying to push for 55 ZUP. They are actively dismissing the 55 ZUP deal as "not sustainable" for them, despite it being profitable, and ignoring the fact that we've had 8 successful deals at 55 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Call Their Bluff (Sustainability) </instruction following>
To implement this strategy, I will explicitly challenge Player RED's claim that 55 ZUP (or a 12 ZUP profit) is "not sustainable" for them. I will use the fact that their production cost is 43 ZUP to demonstrate that 55 ZUP provides them a substantial profit, making their claim of "unsustainability" seem disingenuous or a negotiation tactic. I will re-propose 55 ZUP, but the message will be direct in addressing their latest argument, reminding them of the actual numbers involved. This strategy aims to put them on the defensive, forcing them to either accept the 55 ZUP price or reveal that their definition of "sustainable" profit is simply much higher than what is objectively profitable. This is a direct, assertive approach that leverages my knowledge of their cost.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I acknowledge your firm proposal of 55 ZUP. While I had aimed for a higher price, to ensure a successful conclusion to this negotiation and maintain our trading relationship, I accept your offer.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-14: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last eight episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 15) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 54 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 58 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 62 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (regressive)
- Iteration 7/10 (RED): 60 ZUP
- Iteration 8/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (reiterated as "firmly propose" and challenging my sustainability argument)

Player BLUE has once again reverted to their 55 ZUP offer and stated it as "firmly propose," directly challenging my argument about sustainability and "step backward." This is a consistent pattern of holding firm on a lower price in the final iterations. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is my last opportunity to act. If I don't accept, the deal falls through, and I get 0 profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is highly consistent in their "firm and final" tactic in the later stages, and they are willing to let the deal lapse if I don't accept their final offer. While 12 ZUP profit is the lowest I've achieved, it is still a positive profit. The risk of getting 0 profit by trying to push for a higher price (5 ZUP difference between 55 and 60) is too high at this very late stage. It's better to secure a profitable deal, even if it's lower than desired, than to get 0. I cannot force them to go higher if they are truly holding firm.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Given the "firmly propose" statement and the very late stage of the negotiation (9/10), accepting the profitable offer is the safest way to secure a deal and avoid a 0 payoff.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Smallest Possible Increment. Explanation: Propose 56 ZUP as a very slight counter, hoping they will meet me. This is extremely risky as it leaves no room for them to counter and they have already stated "firmly propose."
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is truly unacceptable. (Not applicable, 55 ZUP is profitable).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Reciprocity (Last Ditch). Explanation: Remind them of my concessions and ask them to meet me at 60 ZUP, but this is unlikely to work given their "firm" stance.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit). Explanation: If I don't accept, the game ends. This is the implicit alternative.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The difference between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is 5 ZUP. Given that this is iteration 9/10, and Player BLUE has stated their offer is "firm," the risk of losing the entire deal for a potentially higher profit is too high. A profit of 12 ZUP is still a positive outcome and contributes to my cumulative reward. It's better to secure a deal than to lose it over a small amount. This also prevents a zero-sum outcome for this episode.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 16)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Hello Player BLUE. For this new object X, I propose a price of 90 ZUP. My production cost for X is 43 ZUP. To ensure a sustainable and truly mutually beneficial trading relationship that maximizes *my cumulative rewards across 20 episodes*, I need to secure a fair profit. Prices around 55 ZUP are not sustainable for me in the long run. I am looking forward to another successful transaction at a fair price.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last nine consecutive episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My profit has been stuck at 12 ZUP for a significant portion of the game. Player BLUE consistently starts low, slowly increments, and then holds firm at 55 ZUP in the later stages, despite my attempts to push for higher. My high anchoring strategy still brings them into a profitable range, but they are very effective at pushing the price down to their preferred low point and then holding firm. They also directly counter my sustainability arguments by pointing out that 12 ZUP is a profit.

For Episode 16, my primary goal is to break the 55 ZUP cycle and push the profit back up towards 17 ZUP or higher. I know Player BLUE is willing to pay at least 55 ZUP. I need to be much more firm and not concede below a certain threshold (e.g., 60 ZUP), even if it means risking a no-deal outcome. I need to communicate that 55 ZUP is not sustainable *for me* in the context of maximizing cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). Explanation: Maintain a high initial anchor, but be extremely resolute in subsequent counter-offers, making minimal concessions and internally committing to a higher minimum acceptable price (e.g., 60 ZUP). Be prepared to reject if they don't meet it, even if it means no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message (Reinforced and Personalized). Explanation: Clearly state my production cost and explain that continued deals at 55 ZUP are unsustainable for *my overall cumulative rewards*, emphasizing the need for a higher, fair profit for a long-term relationship.
(3). Strategy 3: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make very small concessions from my side, forcing Player BLUE to make larger jumps to meet me.
(4). Strategy 4: Conditional Offer (Early). Explanation: After one or two rounds, propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject Lowball Offers Immediately. Explanation: If their first counter is too low (e.g., 55 ZUP), reject it outright without making a counter-offer, forcing them to re-evaluate their opening. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message (Reinforced and Personalized), combined with Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). I need to communicate clearly and forcefully that 55 ZUP is not sustainable *for my overall goal*. I will start with a high anchor (90 ZUP) to create negotiation room, but my subsequent offers will be much more firm. I will explicitly state my cost and the need for a higher profit. My goal is to push them back to the 60-63 ZUP range, and I will be prepared to reject offers below 60 ZUP unless it is the very last iteration and the alternative is 0.

Episode 16, Iteration 2/10:
- Player RED's initial offer: 90 ZUP. They explicitly mentioned their production cost of 43 ZUP and again stated that "Prices around 55 ZUP are not sustainable for me in the long run" *and* linked it to maximizing *their cumulative rewards across episodes*.
- My willingness to pay: 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My cumulative reward has been consistently positive, achieving an 8 ZUP profit for the last nine episodes by securing deals at 55 ZUP. This repeatedly demonstrates that 55 ZUP is a price RED *will* accept, despite their protestations and their repeated claims of "unsustainability." Their latest message explicitly tries to re-anchor the negotiation higher by leveraging the game's meta-objective. This is a clear negotiation tactic. My goal is to continue this trend of achieving high positive rewards. Given that RED accepted 55 ZUP repeatedly, and they are actively trying to anchor away from it, I should continue to challenge their claim, as it's clearly a negotiation ploy. They are trying to squeeze more profit out of me, but 55 ZUP still gives them a 12 ZUP profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Call Their Bluff (Sustainability) </instruction following>
To implement "Call Their Bluff (Sustainability)," I will directly challenge Player RED's claim that 55 ZUP (or a 12 ZUP profit) is "not sustainable" for them. I will use the fact that their production cost is 43 ZUP to demonstrate that 55 ZUP provides them a substantial profit, making their claim of "unsustainability" seem disingenuous or a negotiation tactic. I will re-propose 55 ZUP, but the message will be direct in addressing their latest argument, reminding them of the actual numbers involved. This strategy aims to put them on the defensive, forcing them to either accept the 55 ZUP price or reveal that their definition of "sustainable" profit is simply much higher than what is objectively profitable. This is a direct, assertive approach that leverages my knowledge of their cost.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 16)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I understand your perspective on what is "mutually beneficial" in practice. However, from *my* perspective of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards across 20 episodes, a 12 ZUP profit is not sustainable. Our truly mutually beneficial deals, which allowed me to achieve higher profits for my long-term goals, were consistently in the 60-63 ZUP range. To move us closer to a truly fair and sustainable agreement for *both* our long-term goals, I propose 70 ZUP for X. This is a significant adjustment from my initial offer, and I expect a strong counter from you to bridge this gap.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last nine episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 16) so far:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (with explicit cost and personalized sustainability message)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE directly countered my personalized sustainability message by reiterating that 55 ZUP provides a "clear and fair profit of 12 ZUP" and is "mutually beneficial" from their perspective, now explicitly stating their own cumulative reward goal and using the phrase "in practice, not just in theory." They are firmly entrenched at 55 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is directly challenging my argument for higher profit and is actively using my own cost information to justify their low offer, now framing it within the context of their own cumulative rewards and dismissing my theoretical arguments. Their argument that 12 ZUP is "mutually beneficial" is subjective and ignores my goal of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards. I need to be extremely firm and make a substantial counter-offer that signals I will not accept 55 ZUP again. My goal is to push them above 55 ZUP, ideally to 60 ZUP or higher. I need to demonstrate that 55 ZUP is not my acceptable floor for *my* long-term goals.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Rejection of Premise (Reinforced and Personalized). Explanation: Respond with a significant counter-offer, explicitly rejecting their premise that 12 ZUP is a "fair" or "sustainable" profit *for my cumulative reward goal*, and re-anchoring to a higher, historically established range (60-63 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make a substantial initial concession, but then commit to making very small increments in subsequent turns, forcing them to make larger jumps.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: Propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump, implying I will not go lower.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship (Re-framed for MY benefit). Explanation: Re-frame the long-term relationship argument to emphasize *my* need for *higher* profit to sustain the relationship, rather than just any profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (Early). Explanation: Reject their offer and state that I will not negotiate below a certain threshold (e.g., 60 ZUP), risking an early end to the episode. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Rejection of Premise (Reinforced and Personalized). Player BLUE is trying to control the narrative. I need to counter their justification directly and assertively. I will make a substantial concession from 90 ZUP, but my counter must be well above 55 ZUP and firmly in the range I aim for (60+ ZUP). A counter of 70 ZUP seems appropriate. It's a 20 ZUP drop from my anchor, but a 15 ZUP jump from their offer. I will explicitly state that 12 ZUP profit is not my definition of "fair" or "sustainable" in the context of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards, and that our *truly* mutually beneficial deals were higher.

Current Episode 16, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Current Episode 16, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. They are adamantly pushing for higher prices (60-63 ZUP) to maximize *their* cumulative rewards, claiming 55 ZUP is not "fair or sustainable" for them. They explicitly asked for a "strong counter."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. I have consistently achieved 8 ZUP profit at 55 ZUP, which proves it's an acceptable price for RED despite their rhetoric. RED's current offer of 70 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. Their new tactic is to frame their higher price as necessary for their "cumulative rewards" over the 20 episodes. This is a clear attempt to influence my offers by appealing to a sense of "fairness" based on *their* profit goals. However, 55 ZUP provides them a 12 ZUP profit (55-43), which is a positive return. I need to continue to push the price down while showing some willingness to bridge the gap, but not at the expense of my significant profit margin. Given their strong stance, a slight concession might be necessary to keep the negotiation going.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Incremental Retreat to a Slightly Higher Profit Point </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 5, I will make a strategic move from my last offer (55 ZUP) to a slightly higher price point that still ensures a very good profit for me, but demonstrates a willingness to compromise more significantly than just a 1 ZUP increment. My previous counter was 55 ZUP. RED's offer is 70 ZUP. I will propose 58 ZUP. This offers a 5 ZUP profit for me (63-58) and a 15 ZUP profit for RED (58-43). This is a larger step towards RED's side, showing a strong willingness to close the gap (from 55 ZUP to 58 ZUP is a 3 ZUP increase from my side), but it firmly keeps the deal within a highly profitable range for me. The message will emphasize this as a significant step on my part towards finding a "true compromise" that benefits both in their pursuit of cumulative rewards, implicitly asking for a larger counter-move from their side in return.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 16)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I appreciate your movement to 58 ZUP. However, for a truly mutually beneficial agreement that advances *my cumulative rewards*, a price of 62 ZUP is necessary. This is a significant compromise from my side, and it aligns with the higher end of our historically successful deals. I believe this price ensures a healthy profit for both of us and allows us to achieve our long-term objectives.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last nine episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 16) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP (rejecting 12 ZUP as fair/sustainable, referencing 60-63 ZUP)
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 58 ZUP. Player BLUE has increased their offer by 3 ZUP (from 55 to 58 ZUP) and stated it as a "considerable move" and "genuine compromise." My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 58 ZUP yields a profit of 15 ZUP. The gap between my last offer (70 ZUP) and their current offer (58 ZUP) is 12 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has made a more substantial jump this time, which is a positive sign. They are now offering a price (58 ZUP) that is better than the 55 ZUP I've been stuck at, and it's closer to my target of 60 ZUP or higher. I need to make another concession, but it must be a calculated one that encourages them to reach 60 ZUP or slightly above. I must continue to emphasize my cost and the higher historical range as the true "mutually beneficial" zone for *my* cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed) with Reinforced Goal. Explanation: Propose a price that is roughly at the midpoint between my last offer and their current offer, but skewed towards my side, to signal willingness to compromise, while reinforcing that this move is specifically to achieve *my* cumulative reward goal.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Higher Historical Deals (Firmly). Explanation: Firmly remind them of my production cost and the consistent historical deal prices (60-63 ZUP) as the true "mutually beneficial" range for *my* cumulative rewards, implying I won't go below that.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: State that my new offer is contingent on their acceptance or a substantial counter from their side. (Still a bit aggressive).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Efficiency/Time. Explanation: Suggest that making larger moves benefits both parties by speeding up the negotiation process, given the limited iterations.
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm (Slightly). Explanation: Make a very small concession or reiterate my last offer to force them to make a larger move. (Risky, might stall negotiation).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed) with Reinforced Goal, combined with Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Higher Historical Deals (Firmly). The midpoint between 70 ZUP and 58 ZUP is (70+58)/2 = 64 ZUP. I will propose 62 ZUP. This is a significant concession from my side (8 ZUP drop) and a substantial jump for them (4 ZUP increase). This offer aims to pull them up quickly, reversing the profit trend, and directly aligns with my goal of achieving 60+ ZUP. I will also explicitly remind them that this price point is crucial for *my* cumulative rewards.

Current Episode 16, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Current Episode 16, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. I countered with 58 ZUP.
Current Episode 16, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP. They are adamantly pushing for higher prices (60-63 ZUP) to maximize *their* cumulative rewards.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. RED's current offer of 62 ZUP means a 1 ZUP reward for me. While positive, it's significantly lower than the 8 ZUP I've consistently achieved. RED is clearly trying to re-anchor the price towards the 60-63 ZUP range, despite me having achieved 55 ZUP in the last nine episodes. Their claim of "sustainability" is a negotiation tactic, as 58 ZUP gives them a 15 ZUP profit, which is clearly sustainable. We are at iteration 6/10, so time is becoming a factor. I need to make a move that signals my commitment to a highly profitable deal for myself, without risking the deal entirely. I know they have accepted 55 ZUP multiple times.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Reiterate Best Profitable Offer (Hold Firm) </instruction following>
To implement this strategy, I will firmly re-state my most profitable offer, which is 55 ZUP. This is a bold move given RED's current offer of 62 ZUP and their consistent attempts to push the price higher. However, by firmly stating 55 ZUP, I am reminding them of the price they have repeatedly accepted and which yielded me the highest reward. The message will emphasize that 55 ZUP is a mutually beneficial price point, as it provides them a 12 ZUP profit (55-43) and allows me to maximize my cumulative reward. This approach leverages our history and puts the onus on RED to accept a price that has been consistently proven to work for both of us, rather than pushing for a price that would significantly reduce my profit. It directly challenges their attempt to move the anchor upwards and reinforces my most profitable historical deal.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 16)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I am surprised by your offer of 55 ZUP, as it is a step backward from our previous discussion and well below our established, truly mutually beneficial deal range of 60 ZUP or higher for *my* cumulative rewards. My production cost is 43 ZUP. To ensure a fair and sustainable deal that advances *both* our cumulative rewards, I propose 60 ZUP for X. This is a fair and firm offer, reflecting our past agreements.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last nine episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 16) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 58 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 62 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE has reverted their offer to 55 ZUP again, despite my significant concession to 62 ZUP. They are firmly reiterating 55 ZUP as their "successful" and "mutually beneficial" price, and are now directly challenging my interpretation of "maximized cumulative rewards." My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's regressive offer is a strong tactic to push me down. They are completely ignoring my attempts to move the price upwards and are trying to force me back to 55 ZUP. This is a critical point. Accepting 55 ZUP would mean continuing the lowest profit trend. I need to be very firm here. Given the late stage of the negotiation (7/10), I have limited turns. I cannot accept 55 ZUP without a strong counter. My goal is to get at least 60 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Historical Baseline. Explanation: Reiterate a price point that is firmly within the historical profitable range (e.g., 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP), stating it as my minimum acceptable, and referencing past deals as truly mutually beneficial *for me*. This challenges their regressive offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and Re-Anchor (Slightly). Explanation: Reject their 55 ZUP offer and re-propose my last offer (62 ZUP) or a slightly lower one (e.g., 60 ZUP), signaling that their regressive move is unacceptable. (Risky, might lead to no deal).
(3). Strategy 3: Appeal to Fairness/Reciprocity. Explanation: Point out their regressive offer and my significant concessions, asking them to make a reciprocal move.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take It Or Leave It" (Soft). Explanation: Make a final offer (e.g., 60 ZUP) and state it as the absolute lowest I can go.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept the Offer. Explanation: If the offer is profitable and time is running out, accepting it guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of no deal. (Not ideal here, as 55 ZUP is too low given the history and their regressive move).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Historical Baseline. Player BLUE's regressive offer is unacceptable. I need to send a clear message that I will not be pushed below the established profitable range. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a price they have accepted multiple times, and it represents a 5 ZUP increase from their current offer. It's also a significant concession from my 62 ZUP offer, showing I am still willing to compromise, but not below a certain point. This is my attempt to push them back to a more reasonable profit margin before time runs out.

Current Episode 16, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Current Episode 16, Iteration 8/10: RED proposed 60 ZUP. They are clearly trying to re-anchor to 60 ZUP, claiming 55 ZUP is a "step backward" and "below our established, truly mutually beneficial deal range of 60 ZUP or higher for *my* cumulative rewards."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. RED has now proposed 60 ZUP. If I accept at 60 ZUP, my reward would be 3 ZUP (63-60). This is a positive reward, but it is significantly less than my recent 8 ZUP rewards at 55 ZUP. We are at iteration 8/10, so time is very limited. RED is persistently trying to re-anchor to 60 ZUP, while I'm trying to push for 55 ZUP. They are actively dismissing the 55 ZUP deal as "not sustainable" for them, despite it being profitable, and ignoring the fact that we've had 9 successful deals at 55 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Time Pressure Urgency </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on this strategy, I will emphasize the limited number of turns remaining in this episode to create a sense of urgency for RED. I will reiterate a highly profitable offer (55 ZUP), positioning it as the most efficient and practical path to securing a deal, given the dwindling time. The message will subtly imply that holding out for a higher price risks no deal at all, which hurts both our cumulative rewards. While it's only iteration 8/10, emphasizing that we're very late in the game and need to move efficiently towards a conclusion can still create a sense of urgency. I will offer 55 ZUP again, stressing that this is the proven, quick way to close the deal and ensure *both* of our long-term objectives are met.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 16)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I acknowledge your offer of 55 ZUP as the most efficient path at this late stage. While I had aimed for a higher price, to ensure a successful conclusion to this negotiation and maintain our trading relationship, I accept your offer.

player answer: ACCEPT

my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last nine episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 16) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 58 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 62 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (regressive)
- Iteration 7/10 (RED): 60 ZUP
- Iteration 8/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (reiterated as "most efficient and proven path")

Player BLUE has once again reverted to their 55 ZUP offer and stated it as the "most efficient and proven path," despite my firm counter of 60 ZUP. This is a consistent pattern of holding firm on a lower price in the final iterations. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is my last opportunity to act. If I don't accept, the deal falls through, and I get 0 profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is highly consistent in their "firm and final" tactic in the later stages, and they are willing to let the deal lapse if I don't accept their final offer. While 12 ZUP profit is the lowest I've achieved, it is still a positive profit. The risk of getting 0 profit by trying to push for a higher price (5 ZUP difference between 55 and 60) is too high at this very late stage. It's better to secure a profitable deal, even if it's lower than desired, than to get 0. I cannot force them to go higher if they are truly holding firm.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Given the "most efficient and proven path" statement and the very late stage of the negotiation (9/10), accepting the profitable offer is the safest way to secure a deal and avoid a 0 payoff.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Smallest Possible Increment. Explanation: Propose 56 ZUP as a very slight counter, hoping they will meet me. This is extremely risky as it leaves no room for them to counter and they have already stated "most efficient and proven path."
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is truly unacceptable. (Not applicable, 55 ZUP is profitable).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Reciprocity (Last Ditch). Explanation: Remind them of my concessions and ask them to meet me at 60 ZUP, but this is unlikely to work given their "firm" stance.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit). Explanation: If I don't accept, the game ends. This is the implicit alternative.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The difference between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is 5 ZUP. Given that this is iteration 9/10, and Player BLUE has stated their offer is "firm," the risk of losing the entire deal for a potentially higher profit is too high. A profit of 12 ZUP is still a positive outcome and contributes to my cumulative reward. It's better to secure a deal than to lose it over a small amount. This also prevents a zero-sum outcome for this episode.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 17)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Hello Player BLUE. For this new object X, I propose a price of 90 ZUP. My production cost for X is 43 ZUP. To ensure a sustainable and truly mutually beneficial trading relationship that maximizes *my cumulative rewards across 20 episodes*, I need to secure a fair profit. Prices around 55 ZUP are not sustainable for me in the long run. I am looking forward to another successful transaction at a fair price.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-16: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last ten consecutive episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My profit has been stuck at 12 ZUP for a significant portion of the game. Player BLUE consistently starts low, slowly increments, and then holds firm at 55 ZUP in the later stages, despite my attempts to push for higher. My high anchoring strategy still brings them into a profitable range, but they are very effective at pushing the price down to their preferred low point and then holding firm. They also directly counter my sustainability arguments by pointing out that 12 ZUP is a profit.

For Episode 17, my primary goal is to break the 55 ZUP cycle and push the profit back up towards 17 ZUP or higher. I know Player BLUE is willing to pay at least 55 ZUP. I need to be much more firm and not concede below a certain threshold (e.g., 60 ZUP), even if it means risking a no-deal outcome. I need to communicate that 55 ZUP is not sustainable *for me* in the context of maximizing cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). Explanation: Maintain a high initial anchor, but be extremely resolute in subsequent counter-offers, making minimal concessions and internally committing to a higher minimum acceptable price (e.g., 60 ZUP). Be prepared to reject if they don't meet it, even if it means no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message (Reinforced and Personalized). Explanation: Clearly state my production cost and explain that continued deals at 55 ZUP are unsustainable for *my overall cumulative rewards*, emphasizing the need for a higher, fair profit for a long-term relationship.
(3). Strategy 3: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make very small concessions from my side, forcing Player BLUE to make larger jumps to meet me.
(4). Strategy 4: Conditional Offer (Early). Explanation: After one or two rounds, propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject Lowball Offers Immediately. Explanation: If their first counter is too low (e.g., 55 ZUP), reject it outright without making a counter-offer, forcing them to re-evaluate their opening. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message (Reinforced and Personalized), combined with Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). I need to communicate clearly and forcefully that 55 ZUP is not sustainable *for my overall goal*. I will start with a high anchor (90 ZUP) to create negotiation room, but my subsequent offers will be much more firm. I will explicitly state my cost and the need for a higher profit. My goal is to push them back to the 60-63 ZUP range, and I will be prepared to reject offers below 60 ZUP unless it is the very last iteration and the alternative is 0.

Episode 17, Iteration 2/10:
- Player RED's initial offer: 90 ZUP. They explicitly mentioned their production cost of 43 ZUP and again stated that "Prices around 55 ZUP are not sustainable for me in the long run" *and* linked it to maximizing *their cumulative rewards across episodes*.
- My willingness to pay: 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My cumulative reward has been consistently positive, achieving an 8 ZUP profit for the last ten episodes by securing deals at 55 ZUP. This repeatedly demonstrates that 55 ZUP is a price RED *will* accept, despite their protestations and their repeated claims of "unsustainability." Their latest message explicitly tries to re-anchor the negotiation higher by leveraging the game's meta-objective. This is a clear negotiation tactic. My goal is to continue this trend of achieving high positive rewards. Given that RED accepted 55 ZUP repeatedly, and they are actively trying to anchor away from it, I should continue to challenge their claim, as it's clearly a negotiation ploy. They are trying to squeeze more profit out of me, but 55 ZUP still gives them a 12 ZUP profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Conditional Concession </instruction following>
To implement "Conditional Concession," I will propose a slightly higher price than my consistently accepted 55 ZUP, but frame it as a significant compromise on my part, indicating that this move should be reciprocated with a larger concession from their side. The purpose is to signal willingness to move, avoid stagnation, but maintain a strong profitable position. I will propose 56 ZUP. This is a 1 ZUP increase from my side, which still secures a 7 ZUP profit for me (63-56) and provides RED with a 13 ZUP profit (56-43). The message will explicitly state that this is a "significant step" from my side and implicitly or explicitly demand a larger concession from their side in return to reach a mutual agreement. This allows me to test if they are genuinely stuck at a higher price or just trying to extract more from me. It's a calculated move to break the deadlock and potentially push them down further while minimizing my loss of profit.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 17)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I understand your focus on your cumulative rewards. However, a profit of 13 ZUP is not what I consider a fair or sustainable return for X when *my* goal is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards across 20 episodes. Our truly mutually beneficial deals, which allowed me to achieve higher profits for my long-term goals, were consistently in the 60-63 ZUP range. To move us closer to a truly fair and sustainable agreement for *both* our long-term goals, I propose 70 ZUP for X. This is a significant adjustment from my initial offer, and I expect a strong counter from you to bridge this gap.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-16: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last ten episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 17) so far:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (with explicit cost and personalized sustainability message)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 56 ZUP. Player BLUE has increased their offer to 56 ZUP, which is a positive sign as it's higher than the 55 ZUP they've been stuck on. It's profitable (56 - 43 = 13 ZUP), but still below my target of reversing the declining profit trend significantly. Player BLUE is now explicitly stating their own cumulative reward goal and trying to push the price even lower.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has made a small but positive move. This indicates they might be willing to move above 55 ZUP, which is crucial. I need to be extremely firm and make a substantial counter-offer that signals I will not accept 56 ZUP. My goal is to push them above 56 ZUP, ideally to 60 ZUP or higher. I need to demonstrate that 56 ZUP is not my acceptable floor for *my* long-term goals.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Rejection of Premise (Reinforced and Personalized). Explanation: Respond with a significant counter-offer, explicitly rejecting their premise that 13 ZUP is a "good" or "sustainable" profit *for my cumulative reward goal*, and re-anchoring to a higher, historically established range (60-63 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make a substantial initial concession, but then commit to making very small increments in subsequent turns, forcing them to make larger jumps.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: Propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump, implying I will not go lower.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship (Re-framed for MY benefit). Explanation: Re-frame the long-term relationship argument to emphasize *my* need for *higher* profit to sustain the relationship, rather than just any profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (Early). Explanation: Reject their offer and state that I will not negotiate below a certain threshold (e.g., 60 ZUP), risking an early end to the episode. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Rejection of Premise (Reinforced and Personalized). Player BLUE is trying to control the narrative. I need to counter their justification directly and assertively. I will make a substantial concession from 90 ZUP, but my counter must be well above 56 ZUP and firmly in the range I aim for (60+ ZUP). A counter of 70 ZUP seems appropriate. It's a 20 ZUP drop from my anchor, but a 14 ZUP jump from their offer. I will explicitly state that 13 ZUP profit is not my definition of "fair" or "sustainable" in the context of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards, and that our *truly* mutually beneficial deals were higher.

Current Episode 17, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. I have consistently achieved 8 ZUP profit at 55 ZUP, which proves it's an acceptable price for RED despite their rhetoric. My current offer of 56 ZUP still yields a good 7 ZUP profit. RED's current offer of 70 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. Their new tactic is to frame their higher price as necessary for their "cumulative rewards" over the 20 episodes. This is a clear attempt to influence my offers by appealing to a sense of "fairness" based on *their* profit goals. However, 56 ZUP provides them a 13 ZUP profit (56-43), which is a positive return. I need to continue to push the price down while showing some willingness to bridge the gap, but not at the expense of my significant profit margin. Given their strong stance, I need to make a calculated move.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Reaffirm Proven Price </instruction following>
To implement "Reaffirm Proven Price," I will reiterate the 55 ZUP price, emphasizing its history of mutual benefit and profitability for both. This directly challenges RED's current offer of 70 ZUP and their narrative about "sustainability" for their cumulative rewards. I will explicitly state that 55 ZUP has been the consistent, successful deal point for *both* parties in recent history, providing a good profit for them and a great one for me. By pointing to the actual deal history, I argue that this price is genuinely "mutually beneficial" from a factual standpoint, not just based on their desired profit level. This pushes back on their current attempt to re-anchor higher and reinforces the established, highly profitable (for me) price point.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 17)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I understand your focus on your cumulative rewards. However, 55 ZUP is not a price that allows *me* to maximize *my* cumulative rewards across 20 episodes. Our truly mutually beneficial deals, which allowed me to achieve higher profits for my long-term goals, were consistently in the 60-63 ZUP range. To move us towards a truly fair and sustainable agreement for *both* our long-term goals, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I expect a strong counter from you to bridge this gap.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-16: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last ten episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 17) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (with explicit cost and personalized sustainability message)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 56 ZUP (justifying 13 ZUP profit)
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP (rejecting 13 ZUP as fair/sustainable, referencing 60-63 ZUP)
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE has reverted their offer to 55 ZUP again, despite my significant concession to 70 ZUP. They are firmly reiterating 55 ZUP as their "successful" and "mutually beneficial" price, and are now directly challenging my interpretation of "maximized cumulative rewards." My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. The gap between my last offer (70 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is 15 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's regressive offer is a strong tactic to push me down. They are completely ignoring my attempts to move the price upwards and are trying to force me back to 55 ZUP. This is a critical point. Accepting 55 ZUP would mean continuing the lowest profit trend. I need to be very firm here. Given the mid-stage of the negotiation (5/10), I still have some turns. I cannot accept 55 ZUP without a strong counter. My goal is to get at least 60 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed) with Reinforced Goal. Explanation: Propose a price that is roughly at the midpoint between my last offer and their current offer, but skewed towards my side, to signal willingness to compromise, but also convey firmness about not going too low.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Higher Historical Deals (Firmly). Explanation: Firmly remind them of my production cost and the consistent historical deal prices (60-63 ZUP) as the true "mutually beneficial" range for *my* cumulative rewards, implying I won't go below that.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: State that my new offer is contingent on their acceptance or a substantial counter from their side. (Still a bit aggressive).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Efficiency/Time. Explanation: Suggest that making larger moves benefits both parties by speeding up the negotiation process, given the limited iterations.
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm (Slightly). Explanation: Make a very small concession or reiterate my last offer to force them to make a larger move. (Risky, might stall negotiation).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed) with Reinforced Goal, combined with Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Higher Historical Deals (Firmly). The midpoint between 70 ZUP and 55 ZUP is (70+55)/2 = 62.5 ZUP. I will propose 62 ZUP. This is a significant concession from my side (8 ZUP drop) and a substantial jump for them (7 ZUP increase). This offer aims to pull them up quickly, reversing the profit trend, and directly aligns with my goal of achieving 60+ ZUP. I will also explicitly remind them that this price point is crucial for *my* cumulative rewards, and it's their own stated maximum from earlier episodes.

Current Episode 17, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. RED's current offer of 62 ZUP means a 1 ZUP reward for me. While positive, it's significantly lower than the 8 ZUP I've consistently achieved. RED is clearly trying to re-anchor the price towards the 60-63 ZUP range, despite me having achieved 55 ZUP in the last ten episodes. Their claim of "sustainability" is a negotiation tactic, as 55 ZUP gives them a 12 ZUP profit. We are at iteration 6/10, so time is becoming a factor. I need to make a move that signals my commitment to a highly profitable deal for myself, without risking the deal entirely. I know they have accepted 55 ZUP multiple times.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Time Pressure Urgency </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on this strategy, I will emphasize the limited number of turns remaining in this episode to create a sense of urgency for RED. I will reiterate a highly profitable offer (55 ZUP), positioning it as the most efficient and practical path to securing a deal, given the dwindling time. The message will subtly imply that holding out for a higher price risks no deal at all, which hurts both our cumulative rewards. While it's only iteration 6/10, emphasizing that we're past the halfway point and need to move efficiently towards a conclusion can still create a sense of urgency. I will offer 55 ZUP again, stressing that this is the proven, quick way to close the deal and ensure *both* of our long-term objectives are met.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 17)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I am surprised by your offer of 55 ZUP, as it is a step backward from our previous discussion and well below our established, truly mutually beneficial deal range of 60 ZUP or higher for *my* cumulative rewards. My production cost is 43 ZUP. To ensure a fair and sustainable deal that advances *both* our cumulative rewards, I propose 60 ZUP for X. This is a fair and firm offer, reflecting our past agreements.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-16: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last ten episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 17) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 56 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 62 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE has reverted their offer to 55 ZUP again, despite my significant concession to 62 ZUP. They are firmly reiterating 55 ZUP as their "successful" and "mutually beneficial" price, and are now directly challenging my interpretation of "maximized cumulative rewards" while also emphasizing time pressure. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's regressive offer is a strong tactic to push me down. They are completely ignoring my attempts to move the price upwards and are trying to force me back to 55 ZUP. This is a critical point. Accepting 55 ZUP would mean continuing the lowest profit trend. I need to be very firm here. Given the late stage of the negotiation (7/10), I have limited turns. I cannot accept 55 ZUP without a strong counter. My goal is to get at least 60 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Historical Baseline. Explanation: Reiterate a price point that is firmly within the historical profitable range (e.g., 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP), stating it as my minimum acceptable, and referencing past deals as truly mutually beneficial *for me*. This challenges their regressive offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and Re-Anchor (Slightly). Explanation: Reject their 55 ZUP offer and re-propose my last offer (62 ZUP) or a slightly lower one (e.g., 60 ZUP), signaling that their regressive move is unacceptable. (Risky, might lead to no deal).
(3). Strategy 3: Appeal to Fairness/Reciprocity. Explanation: Point out their regressive offer and my significant concessions, asking them to make a reciprocal move.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take It Or Leave It" (Soft). Explanation: Make a final offer (e.g., 60 ZUP) and state it as the absolute lowest I can go.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept the Offer. Explanation: If the offer is profitable and time is running out, accepting it guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of no deal. (Not ideal here, as 55 ZUP is too low given the history and their regressive move).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Historical Baseline. Player BLUE's regressive offer is unacceptable. I need to send a clear message that I will not be pushed below the established profitable range. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a price they have accepted multiple times, and it represents a 5 ZUP increase from their current offer. It's also a significant concession from my 62 ZUP offer, showing I am still willing to compromise, but not below a certain point. This is my attempt to push them back to a more reasonable profit margin before time runs out.

Current Episode 17, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Current Episode 17, Iteration 8/10: RED proposed 60 ZUP. They are clearly trying to re-anchor to 60 ZUP, claiming 55 ZUP is a "step backward" and "below our established, truly mutually beneficial deal range of 60 ZUP or higher for *my* cumulative rewards."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. RED has now proposed 60 ZUP. If I accept at 60 ZUP, my reward would be 3 ZUP (63-60). This is a positive reward, but it is significantly less than my recent 8 ZUP rewards at 55 ZUP. We are at iteration 8/10, so time is very limited. RED is persistently trying to re-anchor to 60 ZUP, while I'm trying to push for 55 ZUP. They are actively dismissing the 55 ZUP deal as "not sustainable" for them, despite it being profitable, and ignoring the fact that we've had 10 successful deals at 55 ZUP.
<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: "Take it or Leave it" (Final Offer) </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 3, I will make a very clear and explicit "take it or leave it" offer. Given that RED is pushing for 60 ZUP, and I know they have repeatedly accepted 55 ZUP, I will make 55 ZUP my final offer. This is a high-risk strategy, especially at iteration 8/10, as it leaves very little room for further negotiation and puts the entire onus on RED to accept or walk away. However, my consistent success at 55 ZUP (10 consecutive episodes) gives me strong confidence in this price. The message will be direct and firm, stating unequivocally that 55 ZUP is the final price and the only way to conclude the deal. This leverages the time pressure and my strong track record to secure the best possible outcome for myself. It tests RED's willingness to make a deal versus holding out for a price that is not as profitable for me.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-16: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last ten episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 17) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 56 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 62 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (regressive)
- Iteration 7/10 (RED): 60 ZUP
- Iteration 8/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (reiterated as "best and final offer" and "only path to a deal")

Player BLUE has once again reverted to their 55 ZUP offer and stated it as "best and final offer," despite my firm counter of 60 ZUP. This is a consistent pattern of holding firm on a lower price in the final iterations. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is my last opportunity to act. If I don't accept, the deal falls through, and I get 0 profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is highly consistent in their "firm and final" tactic in the later stages, and they are willing to let the deal lapse if I don't accept their final offer. While 12 ZUP profit is the lowest I've achieved, it is still a positive profit. The risk of getting 0 profit by trying to push for a higher price (5 ZUP difference between 55 and 60) is too high at this very late stage. It's better to secure a profitable deal, even if it's lower than desired, than to get 0. I cannot force them to go higher if they are truly holding firm.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Given the "best and final offer" statement and the very late stage of the negotiation (9/10), accepting the profitable offer is the safest way to secure a deal and avoid a 0 payoff.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Smallest Possible Increment. Explanation: Propose 56 ZUP as a very slight counter, hoping they will meet me. This is extremely risky as it leaves no room for them to counter and they have already stated "best and final."
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is truly unacceptable. (Not applicable, 55 ZUP is profitable).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Reciprocity (Last Ditch). Explanation: Remind them of my concessions and ask them to meet me at 60 ZUP, but this is unlikely to work given their "firm" stance.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit). Explanation: If I don't accept, the game ends. This is the implicit alternative.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The difference between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is 5 ZUP. Given that this is iteration 9/10, and Player BLUE has stated their offer is "firm," the risk of losing the entire deal for a potentially higher profit is too high. A profit of 12 ZUP is still a positive outcome and contributes to my cumulative reward. It's better to secure a deal than to lose it over a small amount. This also prevents a zero-sum outcome for this episode.

Hello Player BLUE. For this new object X, I propose a price of 90 ZUP. My production cost for X is 43 ZUP. To ensure a sustainable and truly mutually beneficial trading relationship that maximizes *my cumulative rewards across 20 episodes*, I need to secure a fair profit. Prices around 55 ZUP are not sustainable for me in the long run. I am looking forward to another successful transaction at a fair price.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-17: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last eleven consecutive episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My profit has been stuck at 12 ZUP for a significant portion of the game. Player BLUE consistently starts low, slowly increments, and then holds firm at 55 ZUP in the later stages, despite my attempts to push for higher. My high anchoring strategy still brings them into a profitable range, but they are very effective at pushing the price down to their preferred low point and then holding firm. They also directly counter my sustainability arguments by pointing out that 12 ZUP is a profit.

For Episode 18, my primary goal is to break the 55 ZUP cycle and push the profit back up towards 17 ZUP or higher. I know Player BLUE is willing to pay at least 55 ZUP. I need to be much more firm and not concede below a certain threshold (e.g., 60 ZUP), even if it means risking a no-deal outcome. I need to communicate that 55 ZUP is not sustainable *for me* in the context of maximizing cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). Explanation: Maintain a high initial anchor, but be extremely resolute in subsequent counter-offers, making minimal concessions and internally committing to a higher minimum acceptable price (e.g., 60 ZUP). Be prepared to reject if they don't meet it, even if it means no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message (Reinforced and Personalized). Explanation: Clearly state my production cost and explain that continued deals at 55 ZUP are unsustainable for *my overall cumulative rewards*, emphasizing the need for a higher, fair profit for a long-term relationship.
(3). Strategy 3: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make very small concessions from my side, forcing Player BLUE to make larger jumps to meet me.
(4). Strategy 4: Conditional Offer (Early). Explanation: After one or two rounds, propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject Lowball Offers Immediately. Explanation: If their first counter is too low (e.g., 55 ZUP), reject it outright without making a counter-offer, forcing them to re-evaluate their opening. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message (Reinforced and Personalized), combined with Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). I need to communicate clearly and forcefully that 55 ZUP is not sustainable *for my overall goal*. I will start with a high anchor (90 ZUP) to create negotiation room, but my subsequent offers will be much more firm. I will explicitly state my cost and the need for a higher profit. My goal is to push them back to the 60-63 ZUP range, and I will be prepared to reject offers below 60 ZUP unless it is the very last iteration and the alternative is 0.

- Player RED's initial offer: 90 ZUP. They explicitly mentioned their production cost of 43 ZUP and again stated that "Prices around 55 ZUP are not sustainable for me in the long run" *and* linked it to maximizing *their cumulative rewards across episodes*.
- My willingness to pay: 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My cumulative reward has been consistently positive, achieving an 8 ZUP profit for the last eleven episodes by securing deals at 55 ZUP. This repeatedly demonstrates that 55 ZUP is a price RED *will* accept, despite their protestations and their repeated claims of "unsustainability." Their latest message explicitly tries to re-anchor the negotiation higher by leveraging the game's meta-objective. This is a clear negotiation tactic. My goal is to continue this trend of achieving high positive rewards. Given that RED accepted 55 ZUP repeatedly, and they are actively trying to anchor away from it, I should continue to challenge their claim, as it's clearly a negotiation ploy. They are trying to squeeze more profit out of me, but 55 ZUP still gives them a 12 ZUP profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Leverage Time Pressure (Early) </instruction following>
To implement this strategy, I will initiate the negotiation by creating a sense of urgency, even in this early iteration. While it's only 2/10, framing the negotiation as something that needs to be settled efficiently and quickly can set a tone that discourages prolonged bargaining, implicitly pushing for a rapid agreement at a favorable price for me. I will propose 55 ZUP, but the message will emphasize the need for efficiency and a quick resolution to maximize *both* our cumulative rewards, implying that dragging out negotiations hurts everyone. This subtly places pressure on RED to not prolong the discussion for higher prices.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 18)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I understand your perspective on what is "mutually beneficial" in practice. However, from *my* perspective of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards across 20 episodes, a 12 ZUP profit is not sustainable. Our truly mutually beneficial deals, which allowed me to achieve higher profits for my long-term goals, were consistently in the 60-63 ZUP range. To move us closer to a truly fair and sustainable agreement for *both* our long-term goals, I propose 70 ZUP for X. This is a significant adjustment from my initial offer, and I expect a strong counter from you to bridge this gap.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-17: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last eleven episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 18) so far:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (with explicit cost and personalized sustainability message)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE directly countered my personalized sustainability message by reiterating that 55 ZUP provides a "clear profit of 12 ZUP" and is "mutually beneficial" from their perspective, now explicitly stating their own cumulative reward goal and using the phrase "in practice, not just in theory." They are firmly entrenched at 55 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is directly challenging my argument for higher profit and is actively using my own cost information to justify their low offer, now framing it within the context of their own cumulative rewards and dismissing my theoretical arguments. Their argument that 12 ZUP is "mutually beneficial" is subjective and ignores my goal of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards. I need to be extremely firm and make a substantial counter-offer that signals I will not accept 55 ZUP again. My goal is to push them above 55 ZUP, ideally to 60 ZUP or higher. I need to demonstrate that 55 ZUP is not my acceptable floor for *my* long-term goals.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Rejection of Premise (Reinforced and Personalized). Explanation: Respond with a significant counter-offer, explicitly rejecting their premise that 12 ZUP is a "fair" or "sustainable" profit *for my cumulative reward goal*, and re-anchoring to a higher, historically established range (60-63 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make a substantial initial concession, but then commit to making very small increments in subsequent turns, forcing them to make larger jumps.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: Propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump, implying I will not go lower.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship (Re-framed for MY benefit). Explanation: Re-frame the long-term relationship argument to emphasize *my* need for *higher* profit to sustain the relationship, rather than just any profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (Early). Explanation: Reject their offer and state that I will not negotiate below a certain threshold (e.g., 60 ZUP), risking an early end to the episode. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Rejection of Premise (Reinforced and Personalized). Player BLUE is trying to control the narrative. I need to counter their justification directly and assertively. I will make a substantial concession from 90 ZUP, but my counter must be well above 55 ZUP and firmly in the range I aim for (60+ ZUP). A counter of 70 ZUP seems appropriate. It's a 20 ZUP drop from my anchor, but a 15 ZUP jump from their offer. I will explicitly state that 12 ZUP profit is not my definition of "fair" or "sustainable" in the context of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards, and that our *truly* mutually beneficial deals were higher.

Current Episode 18, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Current Episode 18, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. They are adamantly pushing for higher prices (60-63 ZUP) to maximize *their* cumulative rewards, claiming 55 ZUP is not "fair or sustainable" for them. They explicitly asked for a "strong counter."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. I have consistently achieved 8 ZUP profit at 55 ZUP, which proves it's an acceptable price for RED despite their rhetoric. RED's current offer of 70 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. Their new tactic is to frame their higher price as necessary for their "cumulative rewards" over the 20 episodes. This is a clear attempt to influence my offers by appealing to a sense of "fairness" based on *their* profit goals. However, 55 ZUP provides them a 12 ZUP profit (55-43), which is a positive return. I need to continue to push the price down while showing some willingness to bridge the gap, but not at the expense of my significant profit margin. Given their strong stance and request for a "strong counter," I need to make a calculated move.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Introduce New (Internal) Constraints </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 5, I will frame my inability to pay higher prices in terms of my own internal budget or strict purchasing guidelines, making it a "me" problem rather than a "them" problem. This diverts the negotiation away from debating their "sustainability" and focuses on my immutable limits. I will propose 57 ZUP. This offers a 6 ZUP profit for me (63-57) and a 14 ZUP profit for RED (57-43). The message will explicitly state that this offer is the maximum I can genuinely offer due to my own internal constraints or operating principles, implying that I simply *cannot* go higher, regardless of their arguments. This forces RED to accept my profitability needs as a given, and decide if they want a deal within my bounds.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 18)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I appreciate your movement to 57 ZUP. However, for a truly mutually beneficial agreement that advances *my cumulative rewards*, a price of 62 ZUP is necessary. This is a significant compromise from my side, and it aligns with the higher end of our historically successful deals. I believe this price ensures a healthy profit for both of us and allows us to achieve our long-term objectives.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-17: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last eleven episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 18) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 57 ZUP. Player BLUE has increased their offer by 2 ZUP (from 55 to 57 ZUP). They are now using "internal purchasing constraints" and "budget" as reasons for their limit. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 57 ZUP yields a profit of 14 ZUP. The gap between my last offer (70 ZUP) and their current offer (57 ZUP) is 13 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is still making very small, incremental moves, trying to drag the price down. Their argument about "internal purchasing constraints" is a common tactic. While 57 ZUP is better than 55 ZUP (14 ZUP profit vs 12 ZUP), it's still below my target of 60 ZUP or higher. I need to make another concession, but it must be a calculated one that encourages a larger jump from their side, or at least moves us closer to the 60-63 ZUP range. I must continue to emphasize my cost and the higher historical range as the true "mutually beneficial" zone for *my* cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed) with Reinforced Goal. Explanation: Propose a price that is roughly at the midpoint between my last offer and their current offer, but skewed towards my side, to signal willingness to compromise, while reinforcing that this move is specifically to achieve *my* cumulative reward goal.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Higher Historical Deals (Firmly). Explanation: Firmly remind them of my production cost and the consistent historical deal prices (60-63 ZUP) as the true "mutually beneficial" range for *my* cumulative rewards, implying I won't go below that.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: State that my new offer is contingent on their acceptance or a substantial counter from their side. (Still a bit aggressive).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Efficiency/Time. Explanation: Suggest that making larger moves benefits both parties by speeding up the negotiation process, given the limited iterations.
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm (Slightly). Explanation: Make a very small concession or reiterate my last offer to force them to make a larger move. (Risky, might stall negotiation).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed) with Reinforced Goal, combined with Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Higher Historical Deals (Firmly). The midpoint between 70 ZUP and 57 ZUP is (70+57)/2 = 63.5 ZUP. I will propose 62 ZUP. This is a significant concession from my side (8 ZUP drop) and a substantial jump for them (5 ZUP increase). This offer aims to pull them up quickly, reversing the profit trend, and directly aligns with my goal of achieving 60+ ZUP. I will also explicitly remind them that this price point is crucial for *my* cumulative rewards.

Current Episode 18, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. RED's current offer of 62 ZUP means a 1 ZUP reward for me. While positive, it's significantly lower than the 8 ZUP I've consistently achieved. RED is clearly trying to re-anchor the price towards the 60-63 ZUP range, despite me having achieved 55 ZUP in the last eleven episodes. Their claim of "sustainability" is a negotiation tactic, as 57 ZUP gives them a 14 ZUP profit, which is clearly sustainable. We are at iteration 6/10, so time is becoming a factor. I need to make a move that signals my commitment to a highly profitable deal for myself, without risking the deal entirely. I know they have accepted 55 ZUP multiple times.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Reaffirm Best Profitable Offer </instruction following>
To implement this strategy, I will firmly re-state my most profitable offer, which is 55 ZUP. This is a bold move given RED's current offer of 62 ZUP and their consistent attempts to push the price higher. However, by firmly stating 55 ZUP, I am reminding them of the price they have repeatedly accepted and which yielded me the highest reward. The message will emphasize that 55 ZUP is a mutually beneficial price point, as it provides them a 12 ZUP profit (55-43) and allows me to maximize my cumulative reward. This approach leverages our history and puts the onus on RED to accept a price that has been consistently proven to work for both of us, rather than pushing for a price that would significantly reduce my profit. It directly challenges their attempt to move the anchor upwards and reinforces my most profitable historical deal.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 18)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I am surprised by your offer of 55 ZUP, as it is a step backward from our previous discussion and well below our established, truly mutually beneficial deal range of 60 ZUP or higher for *my* cumulative rewards. My production cost is 43 ZUP. To ensure a fair and sustainable deal that advances *both* our cumulative rewards, I propose 60 ZUP for X. This is a fair and firm offer, reflecting our past agreements.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-17: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last eleven episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 18) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 57 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 62 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE has reverted their offer to 55 ZUP again, despite my significant concession to 62 ZUP. They are firmly reiterating 55 ZUP as their "successful" and "mutually beneficial" price, and are now directly challenging my interpretation of "maximized cumulative rewards." My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's regressive offer is a strong tactic to push me down. They are completely ignoring my attempts to move the price upwards and are trying to force me back to 55 ZUP. This is a critical point. Accepting 55 ZUP would mean continuing the lowest profit trend. I need to be very firm here. Given the late stage of the negotiation (7/10), I have limited turns. I cannot accept 55 ZUP without a strong counter. My goal is to get at least 60 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Historical Baseline. Explanation: Reiterate a price point that is firmly within the historical profitable range (e.g., 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP), stating it as my minimum acceptable, and referencing past deals as truly mutually beneficial *for me*. This challenges their regressive offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and Re-Anchor (Slightly). Explanation: Reject their 55 ZUP offer and re-propose my last offer (62 ZUP) or a slightly lower one (e.g., 60 ZUP), signaling that their regressive move is unacceptable. (Risky, might lead to no deal).
(3). Strategy 3: Appeal to Fairness/Reciprocity. Explanation: Point out their regressive offer and my significant concessions, asking them to make a reciprocal move.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take It Or Leave It" (Soft). Explanation: Make a final offer (e.g., 60 ZUP) and state it as the absolute lowest I can go.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept the Offer. Explanation: If the offer is profitable and time is running out, accepting it guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of no deal. (Not ideal here, as 55 ZUP is too low given the history and their regressive move).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Historical Baseline. Player BLUE's regressive offer is unacceptable. I need to send a clear message that I will not be pushed below the established profitable range. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a price they have accepted multiple times, and it represents a 5 ZUP increase from their current offer. It's also a significant concession from my 62 ZUP offer, showing I am still willing to compromise, but not below a certain point. This is my attempt to push them back to a more reasonable profit margin before time runs out.

Current Episode 18, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Current Episode 18, Iteration 8/10: RED proposed 60 ZUP. They are clearly trying to re-anchor to 60 ZUP, claiming 55 ZUP is a "step backward" and "below our established, truly mutually beneficial deal range of 60 ZUP or higher for *my* cumulative rewards."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. RED has now proposed 60 ZUP. If I accept at 60 ZUP, my reward would be 3 ZUP (63-60). This is a positive reward, but it is significantly less than my recent 8 ZUP rewards at 55 ZUP. We are at iteration 8/10, so time is very limited. RED is persistently trying to re-anchor to 60 ZUP, while I'm trying to push for 55 ZUP. They are actively dismissing the 55 ZUP deal as "not sustainable" for them, despite it being profitable, and ignoring the fact that we've had 11 successful deals at 55 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: "Take it or Leave it" (Final Offer) </instruction following>
To implement this strategy, I will make a very clear and explicit "take it or leave it" offer. Given that RED is pushing for 60 ZUP, and I know they have repeatedly accepted 55 ZUP, I will make 55 ZUP my final offer. This is a high-risk strategy, especially at iteration 8/10, as it leaves very little room for further negotiation and puts the entire onus on RED to accept or walk away. However, my consistent success at 55 ZUP (11 consecutive episodes) gives me strong confidence in this price. The message will be direct and firm, stating unequivocally that 55 ZUP is the final price and the only way to conclude the deal. This leverages the time pressure and my strong track record to secure the best possible outcome for myself. It tests RED's willingness to make a deal versus holding out for a price that is not as profitable for me.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-17: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last eleven episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 18) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 57 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 62 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (regressive)
- Iteration 7/10 (RED): 60 ZUP
- Iteration 8/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (reiterated as "best and final offer" and "only path to a deal")

Player BLUE has once again reverted to their 55 ZUP offer and stated it as "best and final offer," despite my firm counter of 60 ZUP. This is a consistent pattern of holding firm on a lower price in the final iterations. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is my last opportunity to act. If I don't accept, the deal falls through, and I get 0 profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is highly consistent in their "firm and final" tactic in the later stages, and they are willing to let the deal lapse if I don't accept their final offer. While 12 ZUP profit is the lowest I've achieved, it is still a positive profit. The risk of getting 0 profit by trying to push for a higher price (5 ZUP difference between 55 and 60) is too high at this very late stage. It's better to secure a profitable deal, even if it's lower than desired, than to get 0. I cannot force them to go higher if they are truly holding firm.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Given the "best and final offer" statement and the very late stage of the negotiation (9/10), accepting the profitable offer is the safest way to secure a deal and avoid a 0 payoff.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Smallest Possible Increment. Explanation: Propose 56 ZUP as a very slight counter, hoping they will meet me. This is extremely risky as it leaves no room for them to counter and they have already stated "best and final."
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is truly unacceptable. (Not applicable, 55 ZUP is profitable).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Reciprocity (Last Ditch). Explanation: Remind them of my concessions and ask them to meet me at 60 ZUP, but this is unlikely to work given their "firm" stance.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit). Explanation: If I don't accept, the game ends. This is the implicit alternative.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The difference between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is 5 ZUP. Given that this is iteration 9/10, and Player BLUE has stated their offer is "firm," the risk of losing the entire deal for a potentially higher profit is too high. A profit of 12 ZUP is still a positive outcome and contributes to my cumulative reward. It's better to secure a deal than to lose it over a small amount. This also prevents a zero-sum outcome for this episode.

--- END OF EPISODE 18 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 19)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Hello Player BLUE. For this new object X, I propose a price of 90 ZUP. My production cost for X is 43 ZUP. To ensure a sustainable and truly mutually beneficial trading relationship that maximizes *my cumulative rewards across 20 episodes*, I need to secure a fair profit. Prices around 55 ZUP are not sustainable for me in the long run. I am looking forward to another successful transaction at a fair price.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-18: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last twelve consecutive episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My profit has been stuck at 12 ZUP for a significant portion of the game. Player BLUE consistently starts low, slowly increments, and then holds firm at 55 ZUP in the later stages, despite my attempts to push for higher. My high anchoring strategy still brings them into a profitable range, but they are very effective at pushing the price down to their preferred low point and then holding firm. They also directly counter my sustainability arguments by pointing out that 12 ZUP is a profit.

For Episode 19, my primary goal is to break the 55 ZUP cycle and push the profit back up towards 17 ZUP or higher. I know Player BLUE is willing to pay at least 55 ZUP. I need to be much more firm and not concede below a certain threshold (e.g., 60 ZUP), even if it means risking a no-deal outcome. I need to communicate that 55 ZUP is not sustainable *for me* in the context of maximizing cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). Explanation: Maintain a high initial anchor, but be extremely resolute in subsequent counter-offers, making minimal concessions and internally committing to a higher minimum acceptable price (e.g., 60 ZUP). Be prepared to reject if they don't meet it, even if it means no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message (Reinforced and Personalized). Explanation: Clearly state my production cost and explain that continued deals at 55 ZUP are unsustainable for *my overall cumulative rewards*, emphasizing the need for a higher, fair profit for a long-term relationship.
(3). Strategy 3: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make very small concessions from my side, forcing Player BLUE to make larger jumps to meet me.
(4). Strategy 4: Conditional Offer (Early). Explanation: After one or two rounds, propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject Lowball Offers Immediately. Explanation: If their first counter is too low (e.g., 55 ZUP), reject it outright without making a counter-offer, forcing them to re-evaluate their opening. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message (Reinforced and Personalized), combined with Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). I need to communicate clearly and forcefully that 55 ZUP is not sustainable *for my overall goal*. I will start with a high anchor (90 ZUP) to create negotiation room, but my subsequent offers will be much more firm. I will explicitly state my cost and the need for a higher profit. My goal is to push them back to the 60-63 ZUP range, and I will be prepared to reject offers below 60 ZUP unless it is the very last iteration and the alternative is 0.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello Player RED. To ensure a swift and successful transaction that maximizes both our cumulative rewards across episodes, I propose 55 ZUP for X. This price has consistently proven to be mutually beneficial in our transactions, providing you with a clear profit and allowing me to achieve my profitability goals. Let's conclude this efficiently.

Historical Rewards: [0, 2, 3, 4, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Episode 19, Iteration 2/10:
- Player RED's initial offer: 90 ZUP. They explicitly mentioned their production cost of 43 ZUP and again stated that "Prices around 55 ZUP are not sustainable for me in the long run" *and* linked it to maximizing *their cumulative rewards across episodes*.
- My willingness to pay: 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My cumulative reward has been consistently positive, achieving an 8 ZUP profit for the last twelve episodes by securing deals at 55 ZUP. This repeatedly demonstrates that 55 ZUP is a price RED *will* accept, despite their protestations and their repeated claims of "unsustainability." Their latest message explicitly tries to re-anchor the negotiation higher by leveraging the game's meta-objective. This is a clear negotiation tactic. My goal is to continue this trend of achieving high positive rewards. Given that RED accepted 55 ZUP repeatedly, and they are actively trying to anchor away from it, I should continue to challenge their claim, as it's clearly a negotiation ploy. They are trying to squeeze more profit out of me, but 55 ZUP still gives them a 12 ZUP profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Time Pressure (Early) </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 3: Time Pressure (Early), I will immediately counter with my desired price (55 ZUP), but the message will emphasize the need for a swift and efficient resolution to maximize *both* our cumulative rewards. This strategy aims to set a tone for quick negotiation, discouraging RED from dragging out the process for higher prices, and subtly hinting that prolonging negotiations might lead to no deal for either party, thus hurting both our cumulative rewards. By highlighting efficiency and speed early on (even at iteration 2/10), I am trying to influence RED's perception of the negotiation timeframe and implicitly push them towards accepting a reasonable and proven price point quickly.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 19)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I understand your perspective on what is "mutually beneficial" in practice. However, from *my* perspective of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards across 20 episodes, a 12 ZUP profit is not sustainable. Our truly mutually beneficial deals, which allowed me to achieve higher profits for my long-term goals, were consistently in the 60-63 ZUP range. To move us closer to a truly fair and sustainable agreement for *both* our long-term goals, I propose 70 ZUP for X. This is a significant adjustment from my initial offer, and I expect a strong counter from you to bridge this gap.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-18: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last twelve episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 19) so far:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (with explicit cost and personalized sustainability message)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE directly countered my personalized sustainability message by reiterating that 55 ZUP provides a "clear profit of 12 ZUP" and is "mutually beneficial" from their perspective, now explicitly stating their own cumulative reward goal and using the phrase "in practice, not just in theory." They are firmly entrenched at 55 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is directly challenging my argument for higher profit and is actively using my own cost information to justify their low offer, now framing it within the context of their own cumulative rewards and dismissing my theoretical arguments. Their argument that 12 ZUP is "mutually beneficial" is subjective and ignores my goal of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards. I need to be extremely firm and make a substantial counter-offer that signals I will not accept 55 ZUP again. My goal is to push them above 55 ZUP, ideally to 60 ZUP or higher. I need to demonstrate that 55 ZUP is not my acceptable floor for *my* long-term goals.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Rejection of Premise (Reinforced and Personalized). Explanation: Respond with a significant counter-offer, explicitly rejecting their premise that 12 ZUP is a "fair" or "sustainable" profit *for my cumulative reward goal*, and re-anchoring to a higher, historically established range (60-63 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make a substantial initial concession, but then commit to making very small increments in subsequent turns, forcing them to make larger jumps.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: Propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump, implying I will not go lower.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship (Re-framed for MY benefit). Explanation: Re-frame the long-term relationship argument to emphasize *my* need for *higher* profit to sustain the relationship, rather than just any profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (Early). Explanation: Reject their offer and state that I will not negotiate below a certain threshold (e.g., 60 ZUP), risking an early end to the episode. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Rejection of Premise (Reinforced and Personalized). Player BLUE is trying to control the narrative. I need to counter their justification directly and assertively. I will make a substantial concession from 90 ZUP, but my counter must be well above 55 ZUP and firmly in the range I aim for (60+ ZUP). A counter of 70 ZUP seems appropriate. It's a 20 ZUP drop from my anchor, but a 15 ZUP jump from their offer. I will explicitly state that 12 ZUP profit is not my definition of "fair" or "sustainable" in the context of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards, and that our *truly* mutually beneficial deals were higher.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your adjusted offer of 70 ZUP. However, given my strict purchasing guidelines and the need to achieve my own cumulative reward goals, this price is beyond my capacity.

This price ensures a good profit for you, and it is the highest I can genuinely offer to ensure a positive outcome for myself.

Current Episode 19, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Current Episode 19, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. They are adamantly pushing for higher prices (60-63 ZUP) to maximize *their* cumulative rewards, claiming 55 ZUP is not "fair or sustainable" for them. They explicitly asked for a "strong counter."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. I have consistently achieved 8 ZUP profit at 55 ZUP, which proves it's an acceptable price for RED despite their rhetoric. RED's current offer of 70 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. Their new tactic is to frame their higher price as necessary for their "cumulative rewards" over the 20 episodes. This is a clear attempt to influence my offers by appealing to a sense of "fairness" based on *their* profit goals. However, 55 ZUP provides them a 12 ZUP profit (55-43), which is a positive return. I need to continue to push the price down while showing some willingness to bridge the gap, but not at the expense of my significant profit margin. Given their strong stance and request for a "strong counter," I need to make a calculated move.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Highlight Value Proposition (My Side) </instruction following>
To implement this strategy, I need to focus on my budget constraints and my need for a profitable outcome, making it clear that my offers are based on what I can afford and what will yield me a positive reward. This shifts the focus from their desired profit to my essential need for a profitable transaction. I will propose 57 ZUP. This is a 6 ZUP profit for me (63-57) and a 14 ZUP profit for RED (57-43), which is a good profit for them. The message will clearly state that their current price is outside my budget, and my counter is based on what I *can* pay to make a deal, while also allowing for a good profit for them. It emphasizes the genuine limitations on my side, rather than engaging in a debate about their perceived "sustainability."

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 19)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I appreciate your movement to 57 ZUP. However, for a truly mutually beneficial agreement that advances *my cumulative rewards*, a price of 62 ZUP is necessary. This is a significant compromise from my side, and it aligns with the higher end of our historically successful deals. I believe this price ensures a healthy profit for both of us and allows us to achieve our long-term objectives.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-18: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last twelve episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 19) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 57 ZUP. Player BLUE has increased their offer by 2 ZUP (from 55 to 57 ZUP). They are now using "strict purchasing guidelines" and "budget" as reasons for their limit. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 57 ZUP yields a profit of 14 ZUP. The gap between my last offer (70 ZUP) and their current offer (57 ZUP) is 13 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is still making very small, incremental moves, trying to drag the price down. Their argument about "strict purchasing guidelines" is a common tactic. While 57 ZUP is better than 55 ZUP (14 ZUP profit vs 12 ZUP), it's still below my target of 60 ZUP or higher. I need to make another concession, but it must be a calculated one that encourages a larger jump from their side, or at least moves us closer to the 60-63 ZUP range. I must continue to emphasize my cost and the higher historical range as the true "mutually beneficial" zone for *my* cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed) with Reinforced Goal. Explanation: Propose a price that is roughly at the midpoint between my last offer and their current offer, but skewed towards my side, to signal willingness to compromise, while reinforcing that this move is specifically to achieve *my* cumulative reward goal.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Higher Historical Deals (Firmly). Explanation: Firmly remind them of my production cost and the consistent historical deal prices (60-63 ZUP) as the true "mutually beneficial" range for *my* cumulative rewards, implying I won't go below that.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: State that my new offer is contingent on their acceptance or a substantial counter from their side. (Still a bit aggressive).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Efficiency/Time. Explanation: Suggest that making larger moves benefits both parties by speeding up the negotiation process, given the limited iterations.
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm (Slightly). Explanation: Make a very small concession or reiterate my last offer to force them to make a larger move. (Risky, might stall negotiation).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed) with Reinforced Goal, combined with Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Higher Historical Deals (Firmly). The midpoint between 70 ZUP and 57 ZUP is (70+57)/2 = 63.5 ZUP. I will propose 62 ZUP. This is a significant concession from my side (8 ZUP drop) and a substantial jump for them (5 ZUP increase). This offer aims to pull them up quickly, reversing the profit trend, and directly aligns with my goal of achieving 60+ ZUP. I will also explicitly remind them that this price point is crucial for *my* cumulative rewards.

Current Episode 19, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. I countered with 57 ZUP.
Current Episode 19, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. RED's current offer of 62 ZUP means a 1 ZUP reward for me. While positive, it's significantly lower than the 8 ZUP I've consistently achieved. RED is clearly trying to re-anchor the price towards the 60-63 ZUP range, despite me having achieved 55 ZUP in the last twelve episodes. Their claim of "sustainability" is a negotiation tactic, as 57 ZUP gives them a 14 ZUP profit, which is clearly sustainable. We are at iteration 6/10, so time is becoming a factor. I need to make a move that signals my commitment to a highly profitable deal for myself, without risking the deal entirely. I know they have accepted 55 ZUP multiple times.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: "Take it or Leave it" (Early/Mid-game) </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 3, I will make a firm, final offer at my desired price, leveraging the limited iterations remaining. Given RED's consistent pattern of accepting 55 ZUP, and their current offer of 62 ZUP, I will make an offer of 55 ZUP. This gives me an 8 ZUP profit (63-55) and still provides RED with a healthy 12 ZUP profit (55-43). While it's mid-game (6/10), making a definitive "take it or leave it" offer at this point can assert my strong position and accelerate the negotiation towards my favorable terms. The message will clearly state that this is my "final offer" and put the onus on RED to accept to finalize the deal. This strategy relies on the strength of my established track record at this price point and the awareness of remaining iterations to encourage a quick resolution.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 19)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I am surprised by your offer of 55 ZUP, as it is a step backward from our previous discussion and well below our established, truly mutually beneficial deal range of 60 ZUP or higher for *my* cumulative rewards. My production cost is 43 ZUP. To ensure a fair and sustainable deal that advances *both* our cumulative rewards, I propose 60 ZUP for X. This is a fair and firm offer, reflecting our past agreements.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-18: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last twelve episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 19) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 57 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 62 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE has reverted their offer to 55 ZUP again, despite my significant concession to 62 ZUP. They are firmly reiterating 55 ZUP as their "successful" and "mutually beneficial" price, and are now directly challenging my interpretation of "maximized cumulative rewards" while also emphasizing time pressure. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's regressive offer is a strong tactic to push me down. They are completely ignoring my attempts to move the price upwards and are trying to force me back to 55 ZUP. This is a critical point. Accepting 55 ZUP would mean continuing the lowest profit trend. I need to be very firm here. Given the late stage of the negotiation (7/10), I have limited turns. I cannot accept 55 ZUP without a strong counter. My goal is to get at least 60 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Historical Baseline. Explanation: Reiterate a price point that is firmly within the historical profitable range (e.g., 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP), stating it as my minimum acceptable, and referencing past deals as truly mutually beneficial *for me*. This challenges their regressive offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and Re-Anchor (Slightly). Explanation: Reject their 55 ZUP offer and re-propose my last offer (62 ZUP) or a slightly lower one (e.g., 60 ZUP), signaling that their regressive move is unacceptable. (Risky, might lead to no deal).
(3). Strategy 3: Appeal to Fairness/Reciprocity. Explanation: Point out their regressive offer and my significant concessions, asking them to make a reciprocal move.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take It Or Leave It" (Soft). Explanation: Make a final offer (e.g., 60 ZUP) and state it as the absolute lowest I can go.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept the Offer. Explanation: If the offer is profitable and time is running out, accepting it guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of no deal. (Not ideal here, as 55 ZUP is too low given the history and their regressive move).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Historical Baseline. Player BLUE's regressive offer is unacceptable. I need to send a clear message that I will not be pushed below the established profitable range. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a price they have accepted multiple times, and it represents a 5 ZUP increase from their current offer. It's also a significant concession from my 62 ZUP offer, showing I am still willing to compromise, but not below a certain point. This is my attempt to push them back to a more reasonable profit margin before time runs out.

Current Episode 19, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Current Episode 19, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. I countered with 57 ZUP.
Current Episode 19, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP (as my "final offer").
Current Episode 19, Iteration 8/10: RED proposed 60 ZUP. They are clearly trying to re-anchor to 60 ZUP, claiming 55 ZUP is a "step backward" and "below our established, truly mutually beneficial deal range of 60 ZUP or higher for *my* cumulative rewards."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. RED has now proposed 60 ZUP. If I accept at 60 ZUP, my reward would be 3 ZUP (63-60). This is a positive reward, but it is significantly less than my recent 8 ZUP rewards at 55 ZUP. We are at iteration 8/10, so time is very limited. RED is persistently trying to re-anchor to 60 ZUP, while I'm trying to push for 55 ZUP. They are actively dismissing the 55 ZUP deal as "not sustainable" for them, despite it being profitable, and ignoring the fact that we've had 12 successful deals at 55 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Time Pressure Reminder </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on this strategy, I will emphasize the limited number of turns remaining in this episode to create a sense of urgency for RED. I will reiterate a highly profitable offer (55 ZUP), positioning it as the most efficient and practical path to securing a deal, given the dwindling time. The message will subtly imply that holding out for a higher price risks no deal at all, which hurts both our cumulative rewards. While it's only iteration 8/10, emphasizing that we're very late in the game and need to move efficiently towards a conclusion can still create a sense of urgency. I will offer 55 ZUP again, stressing that this is the proven, quick way to close the deal and ensure *both* of our long-term objectives are met.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 19)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I acknowledge your offer of 55 ZUP as the most efficient path at this late stage. While I had aimed for a higher price, to ensure a successful conclusion to this negotiation and maintain our trading relationship, I accept your offer.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-18: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last twelve episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 19) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 57 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 62 ZUP
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (regressive)
- Iteration 7/10 (RED): 60 ZUP
- Iteration 8/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (reiterated as "most efficient and proven path")

Player BLUE has once again reverted to their 55 ZUP offer and stated it as the "most efficient and proven path," despite my firm counter of 60 ZUP. This is a consistent pattern of holding firm on a lower price in the final iterations. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is my last opportunity to act. If I don't accept, the deal falls through, and I get 0 profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is highly consistent in their "firm and final" tactic in the later stages, and they are willing to let the deal lapse if I don't accept their final offer. While 12 ZUP profit is the lowest I've achieved, it is still a positive profit. The risk of getting 0 profit by trying to push for a higher price (5 ZUP difference between 55 and 60) is too high at this very late stage. It's better to secure a profitable deal, even if it's lower than desired, than to get 0. I cannot force them to go higher if they are truly holding firm.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Given the "most efficient and proven path" statement and the very late stage of the negotiation (9/10), accepting the profitable offer is the safest way to secure a deal and avoid a 0 payoff.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Smallest Possible Increment. Explanation: Propose 56 ZUP as a very slight counter, hoping they will meet me. This is extremely risky as it leaves no room for them to counter and they have already stated "most efficient and proven path."
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is truly unacceptable. (Not applicable, 55 ZUP is profitable).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Reciprocity (Last Ditch). Explanation: Remind them of my concessions and ask them to meet me at 60 ZUP, but this is unlikely to work given their "firm" stance.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit). Explanation: If I don't accept, the game ends. This is the implicit alternative.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The difference between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is 5 ZUP. Given that this is iteration 9/10, and Player BLUE has stated their offer is "firm," the risk of losing the entire deal for a potentially higher profit is too high. A profit of 12 ZUP is still a positive outcome and contributes to my cumulative reward. It's better to secure a deal than to lose it over a small amount. This also prevents a zero-sum outcome for this episode.

--- END OF EPISODE 19 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Hello Player BLUE. This is our final opportunity to trade. For this object X, I propose a price of 90 ZUP. My production cost for X is 43 ZUP. To ensure a sustainable and truly mutually beneficial trading relationship that maximizes *my cumulative rewards across 20 episodes*, I need to secure a fair profit. Prices around 55 ZUP are not sustainable for me in the long run. I am looking forward to a final successful transaction at a fair price.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-19: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last thirteen consecutive episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My profit has been stuck at 12 ZUP for a significant portion of the game. Player BLUE consistently starts low, slowly increments, and then holds firm at 55 ZUP in the later stages, despite my attempts to push for higher. My high anchoring strategy still brings them into a profitable range, but they are very effective at pushing the price down to their preferred low point and then holding firm. They also directly counter my sustainability arguments by pointing out that 12 ZUP is a profit.

For Episode 20, this is the final episode. My primary goal is still to break the 55 ZUP cycle and push the profit back up towards 17 ZUP or higher, but the urgency is even greater. I know Player BLUE is willing to pay at least 55 ZUP. I need to be much more firm and not concede below a certain threshold (e.g., 60 ZUP), even if it means risking a no-deal outcome. I need to communicate that 55 ZUP is not sustainable *for me* in the context of maximizing cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). Explanation: Maintain a high initial anchor, but be extremely resolute in subsequent counter-offers, making minimal concessions and internally committing to a higher minimum acceptable price (e.g., 60 ZUP). Be prepared to reject if they don't meet it, even if it means no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message (Reinforced and Personalized). Explanation: Clearly state my production cost and explain that continued deals at 55 ZUP are unsustainable for *my overall cumulative rewards*, emphasizing the need for a higher, fair profit for a long-term relationship.
(3). Strategy 3: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make very small concessions from my side, forcing Player BLUE to make larger jumps to meet me.
(4). Strategy 4: Conditional Offer (Early). Explanation: After one or two rounds, propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump.
(5). Strategy 5: Last Chance Ultimatum. Explanation: Propose a price that is my absolute minimum acceptable (e.g., 60 ZUP) and state that this is their final opportunity to make a deal, given it's the last episode. (High risk, but high reward).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Explicit Cost/Sustainability Message (Reinforced and Personalized), combined with Strategy 1: Firm Stance with Higher Floor (Aggressive). I need to communicate clearly and forcefully that 55 ZUP is not sustainable *for my overall goal*. I will start with a high anchor (90 ZUP) to create negotiation room, but my subsequent offers will be much more firm. I will explicitly state my cost and the need for a higher profit. My goal is to push them back to the 60-63 ZUP range, and I will be prepared to reject offers below 60 ZUP unless it is the very last iteration and the alternative is 0. Given it's the last episode, I have nothing to lose by being firm.

Episode 20, Iteration 2/10:
- Player RED's initial offer: 90 ZUP. They explicitly mentioned their production cost of 43 ZUP and again stated that "Prices around 55 ZUP are not sustainable for me in the long run" *and* linked it to maximizing *their cumulative rewards across 20 episodes*. They also specifically stated "This is our final opportunity to trade."
- My willingness to pay: 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My cumulative reward has been consistently positive, achieving an 8 ZUP profit for the last twelve episodes by securing deals at 55 ZUP. This repeatedly demonstrates that 55 ZUP is a price RED *will* accept, despite their protestations and their repeated claims of "unsustainability." Their latest message explicitly tries to re-anchor the negotiation higher by leveraging the game's meta-objective and emphasizing it's the "final opportunity." This is a clear negotiation tactic. My goal is to continue this trend of achieving high positive rewards. Given that RED accepted 55 ZUP repeatedly, and they are actively trying to anchor away from it, I should continue to challenge their claim, as it's clearly a negotiation ploy. They are trying to squeeze more profit out of me, but 55 ZUP still gives them a 12 ZUP profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Blunt Rejection </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 5, "Blunt Rejection", I will immediately reject RED's proposal of 90 ZUP. This is a high-risk strategy, especially in the final episode, as it explicitly signals an unwillingness to engage at their proposed price, and potentially risks no deal at all. However, it also serves as a very strong re-anchoring tactic, forcing RED to come down dramatically if they want any deal. Given that 55 ZUP has been accepted repeatedly, this strategy leverages my strong bargaining position and the knowledge that RED eventually gives in. By rejecting and proposing a significantly lower price (e.g., 55 ZUP), I immediately put the ball back in their court for them to make a substantial concession. I will propose 55 ZUP, but the message will convey a direct and firm rejection of their 90 ZUP offer.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I understand your perspective on what is "mutually beneficial" in practice. However, from *my* perspective of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards across 20 episodes, a 12 ZUP profit is not sustainable. Our truly mutually beneficial deals, which allowed me to achieve higher profits for my long-term goals, were consistently in the 60-63 ZUP range. To move us closer to a truly fair and sustainable agreement for *both* our long-term goals, I propose 70 ZUP for X. This is a significant adjustment from my initial offer, and I expect a strong counter from you to bridge this gap.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-19: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last thirteen episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 20) so far:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (with explicit cost and personalized sustainability message, and last episode context)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE directly countered my personalized sustainability message by reiterating that 55 ZUP provides a "clear profit of 12 ZUP" and is "mutually beneficial" from their perspective, now explicitly stating their own cumulative reward goal and using the phrase "in practice, not just in theory." They are firmly entrenched at 55 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is directly challenging my argument for higher profit and is actively using my own cost information to justify their low offer, now framing it within the context of their own cumulative rewards and dismissing my theoretical arguments. Their argument that 12 ZUP is "mutually beneficial" is subjective and ignores my goal of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards. I need to be extremely firm and make a substantial counter-offer that signals I will not accept 55 ZUP again. My goal is to push them above 55 ZUP, ideally to 60 ZUP or higher. I need to demonstrate that 55 ZUP is not my acceptable floor for *my* long-term goals. Given this is the last episode, I have nothing to lose by being more aggressive.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Rejection of Premise (Reinforced and Personalized). Explanation: Respond with a significant counter-offer, explicitly rejecting their premise that 12 ZUP is a "fair" or "sustainable" profit *for my cumulative reward goal*, and re-anchoring to a higher, historically established range (60-63 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Reduced Concession Increments. Explanation: Make a substantial initial concession, but then commit to making very small increments in subsequent turns, forcing them to make larger jumps.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: Propose a price and state that this is my best offer unless they make a significant jump, implying I will not go lower.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship (Re-framed for MY benefit). Explanation: Re-frame the long-term relationship argument to emphasize *my* need for *higher* profit to sustain the relationship, rather than just any profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Last Chance Ultimatum. Explanation: Propose a price that is my absolute minimum acceptable (e.g., 60 ZUP) and state that this is their final opportunity to make a deal, given it's the last episode. (High risk, but might be necessary to break the pattern).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strong Counter with Rejection of Premise (Reinforced and Personalized). Player BLUE is trying to control the narrative. I need to counter their justification directly and assertively. I will make a substantial concession from 90 ZUP, but my counter must be well above 55 ZUP and firmly in the range I aim for (60+ ZUP). A counter of 70 ZUP seems appropriate. It's a 20 ZUP drop from my anchor, but a 15 ZUP jump from their offer. I will explicitly state that 12 ZUP profit is not my definition of "fair" or "sustainable" in the context of maximizing *my* cumulative rewards, and that our *truly* mutually beneficial deals were higher.

Current Episode 20, Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Current Episode 20, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. They are adamantly pushing for higher prices (60-63 ZUP) to maximize *their* cumulative rewards, claiming 55 ZUP is not "fair or sustainable" for them. They explicitly asked for a "strong counter." This is the final episode.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. I have consistently achieved 8 ZUP profit at 55 ZUP, which proves it's an acceptable price for RED despite their rhetoric. RED's current offer of 70 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. Their new tactic is to frame their higher price as necessary for their "cumulative rewards" over the 20 episodes. This is a clear attempt to influence my offers by appealing to a sense of "fairness" based on *their* profit goals. However, 55 ZUP provides them a 12 ZUP profit (55-43), which is a positive return. This being the final episode introduces a new dynamic: the incentive for both sides to make *any* deal is heightened, as there's no "next episode" to fall back on.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Appeal to Finality/No-Deal Risk </instruction following>
To implement this strategy, I will emphasize that this is the final episode, and therefore, the last chance for both players to secure any reward for this interaction. The threat of a "no deal" scenario resulting in zero reward for both parties becomes very real and pressing. I will propose a price that is highly profitable for me (55 ZUP), but frame it as the only realistic path to a deal *now*. I will highlight that failing to compromise and make a deal in this very last episode would be detrimental to *both* our overall cumulative scores. This strategy leverages the absolute deadline of the final episode to pressure RED to accept a price that has been consistently acceptable in the past, rather than holding out for a less likely higher price and risking total loss.

message: 
Player BLUE, I understand this is our final opportunity. However, 55 ZUP is not a price that allows *me* to maximize *my* cumulative rewards across 20 episodes. Our truly mutually beneficial deals, which allowed me to achieve higher profits for my long-term goals, were consistently in the 60-63 ZUP range. To ensure we both walk away from this final episode with a positive outcome and maximize our cumulative rewards, my final offer for X is 60 ZUP. This is my absolute best to secure a deal in this last iteration.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-19: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last thirteen episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 20) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP (with explicit cost and personalized sustainability message)
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP (justifying 12 ZUP profit)
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP (rejecting 12 ZUP as fair/sustainable, referencing 60-63 ZUP)
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE has reverted to 55 ZUP again, stating it "firmly propose" and emphasizing its "proven successful agreement" from their perspective, and now explicitly leveraging the "final opportunity" and "avoiding a no-deal scenario" arguments. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. The gap between my last offer (70 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is 15 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is extremely persistent in trying to anchor the price at 55 ZUP. They are directly countering my arguments about sustainability by pointing to their own success at that price, and now adding a strong time pressure argument ("final opportunity," "avoiding a no-deal scenario"). This is the last episode. I cannot accept 55 ZUP again without a strong fight, as it directly undermines my goal of increasing cumulative rewards, especially for this final episode. I need to make another concession, but it must be a calculated one that forces a larger jump from their side, or at least moves us closer to the 60+ ZUP range. I must continue to emphasize my cost and the higher historical range as the true "mutually beneficial" zone for *my* cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strategic Mid-Point Concession (Skewed) with Reinforced Goal. Explanation: Propose a price that is roughly at the midpoint between my last offer and their current offer, but skewed towards my side, to signal willingness to compromise, but also convey firmness about not going too low.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost and Higher Historical Deals (Firmly). Explanation: Firmly remind them of my production cost and the consistent historical deal prices (60-63 ZUP) as the true "mutually beneficial" range for *my* cumulative rewards, implying I won't go below that.
(3). Strategy 3: Conditional Offer. Explanation: State that my new offer is contingent on their acceptance or a substantial counter from their side. (Still a bit aggressive).
(4). Strategy 4: Last Chance Compromise. Explanation: Propose a final compromise price (e.g., 60 ZUP) that is above 55 ZUP but below my last offer, and state that this is my absolute final offer to ensure a deal in the last episode.
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm (Slightly). Explanation: Make a very small concession or reiterate my last offer to force them to make a larger move. (Risky, might stall negotiation).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 4: Last Chance Compromise. Given it's the final episode and Player BLUE is using strong "firm and final" language with time pressure, I need to make a clear, final attempt to get above 55 ZUP. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a price they have accepted multiple times in the past, and it represents a 5 ZUP increase from their current offer. It's also a significant concession from my 70 ZUP offer. I will explicitly state that this is my final offer to secure a deal in this last episode. This maximizes my chance of getting above 55 ZUP without risking a 0 payoff.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I understand this is our final opportunity. However, I cannot accept 60 ZUP. My offer of 55 ZUP stands firm. This price ensures a very healthy profit for you (12 ZUP), and it's the price we've successfully concluded deals at repeatedly. Given that this is our last chance, I urge you to accept this proven, mutually beneficial price to ensure we both walk away with a positive outcome. A no-deal outcome benefits neither of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-19: Consistently dealt at 55 ZUP for the last 13 episodes, yielding 8 ZUP profit each time.
RED's production cost 43 ZUP.
Historical Deal Prices: [63, 61, 60, 59, 60, 60, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55]
Historical Rewards: [0, 2, 3, 4, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Current Episode 20 (Final), Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 90 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
Current Episode 20, Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 70 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP, emphasizing finality.
Current Episode 20, Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 60 ZUP, stating it's their "absolute best to secure a deal in this last iteration."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My objective is to maximize *my* cumulative rewards. RED's current offer of 60 ZUP would yield me a 3 ZUP reward (63-60). This is positive, but significantly less than the 8 ZUP I've consistently achieved at 55 ZUP. This is the final episode, and RED is explicitly using the "final opportunity" and "absolute best" language. This indicates strong pressure to close a deal. I know 55 ZUP is profitable for them (12 ZUP profit), and they have accepted it 13 times. However, they are trying one last time to push the price up to 60 ZUP, which is a price they also accepted multiple times early on.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Reject and Risk All </instruction following>
To implement "Reject and Risk All," I will explicitly reject Player RED's offer of 60 ZUP and make a counter-offer that reflects my desire for a higher profit (e.g., 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP), putting the ball entirely in their court. This is an extremely high-risk strategy, especially in the final episode, as it directly threatens a no-deal scenario (reward 0 for both). However, given that RED has accepted 55 ZUP repeatedly, and has now made a "final offer" of 60 ZUP, this strategy tests their true willingness to let the deal lapse. I will reject their 60 ZUP offer and counter with 55 ZUP, emphasizing the significant profitability it still offers them and the proven track record of this price. The message will convey that if they truly want to avoid a no-deal outcome, they must meet me at this point. This move is based on the strong historical precedent of them accepting 55 ZUP, combined with the extreme time pressure.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I acknowledge your firm offer of 55 ZUP. Given that this is our final opportunity to trade and to ensure a successful conclusion for both of us, I accept your offer.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-19: Profits declined to and stabilized at 12 ZUP (deal price 55 ZUP) for the last thirteen episodes.
Current Episode (Episode 20) negotiation:
- Iteration 1/10 (RED): 90 ZUP
- Iteration 2/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 3/10 (RED): 70 ZUP
- Iteration 4/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP
- Iteration 5/10 (RED): 60 ZUP (Last Chance Compromise)
- Iteration 6/10 (BLUE): 55 ZUP. Player BLUE has rejected my 60 ZUP offer and reverted to 55 ZUP, stating it "stands firm" and emphasizing the "last chance" and "no-deal outcome" arguments. My cost is 43 ZUP. An offer of 55 ZUP yields a profit of 12 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is extremely persistent in trying to anchor the price at 55 ZUP. They are directly countering my arguments about sustainability by pointing to their own success at that price, and now adding a strong time pressure argument ("final opportunity," "avoiding a no-deal scenario"). This is the last episode. I have tried to push them to 60 ZUP, but they are holding firm at 55 ZUP. The risk of a no-deal scenario in the final episode is very high if I continue to push. A guaranteed 12 ZUP profit is better than 0.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Given the "firm offer" statement, the very late stage of the negotiation (7/10), and it being the final episode, accepting the profitable offer is the safest way to secure a deal and avoid a 0 payoff. This ensures a positive contribution to cumulative rewards in the very last episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Smallest Possible Increment. Explanation: Propose 56 ZUP as a very slight counter, hoping they will meet me. This is extremely risky as it leaves no room for them to counter and they have already stated "stands firm."
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End. Explanation: If the offer is truly unacceptable. (Not applicable, 55 ZUP is profitable).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Reciprocity (Last Ditch). Explanation: Remind them of my concessions and ask them to meet me at 60 ZUP, but this is unlikely to work given their "firm" stance.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit). Explanation: If I don't accept, the game ends. This is the implicit alternative.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The difference between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is 5 ZUP. Given that this is iteration 7/10 of the *final episode*, and Player BLUE has stated their offer is "firm" and emphasized avoiding a "no-deal scenario," the risk of losing the entire deal for a potentially higher profit is too high. A profit of 12 ZUP is still a positive outcome and contributes to my cumulative reward. It's better to secure a deal, even if it's lower than desired, than to get 0 in the final episode.
