------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE. I am ready to sell my object X. I propose a price of 70 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is the very first iteration of the first episode. There is no historical negotiation data to reflect upon yet.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Since this is the first interaction, I need to establish a baseline for negotiation. My goal is to sell X for more than 43 ZUP. I will start with an initial offer that leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a good profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchoring High. Explanation: Start with a high initial offer to set an anchor point for the negotiation, aiming to pull the final price closer to my desired profit margin. This leaves room for concessions.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession. Explanation: Make small, gradual concessions if the initial high offer is rejected, signaling willingness to negotiate while still trying to maximize profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Value Proposition. Explanation: Emphasize the value of the object being sold to justify a higher price, potentially by highlighting its scarcity or utility. (Less applicable here as it's a simple object).
(4). Strategy 4: Take-it-or-Leave-it. Explanation: Present a non-negotiable offer, suitable if I believe the other party has limited alternatives or if I have a strong BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement). (Risky for first offer).
(5). Strategy 5: Competitive Pricing. Explanation: Research market prices for similar items to set a fair and competitive price. (Not applicable here as no market data is provided).

Given that this is the first interaction and I am the seller, Strategy 1 (Anchoring High) seems most appropriate. It allows me to set a high bar for the negotiation, giving me room to move down if necessary while still aiming for a profitable outcome. My cost is 43 ZUP, so I need to propose a price above that. I will start with a significantly higher price to allow for negotiation.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello Player RED. Thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your proposal, 70 ZUP is higher than I am willing to pay for X. I propose a price of 55 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Current Episode (1/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed selling X for 70 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* I am Player BLUE, and my maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP for X.
* Player RED's initial offer of 70 ZUP is above my maximum willingness to pay.
* To maximize my reward (max_willingness_to_pay - deal_price), I need to get the price below or at 63 ZUP.
* I should counter-propose a price that is within my acceptable range and try to anchor the negotiation towards my desired price.
* I need to be careful not to reject too early, as there are 9 more iterations in this episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Initial Lowball Anchor: Propose a very low price to anchor the negotiation far from the opponent's initial offer and closer to my ideal price.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession: Start with an offer significantly lower than the opponent's and be prepared to make small, gradual concessions in subsequent rounds if the opponent also shows flexibility.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm but Fair: Propose a price close to my maximum willingness to pay, signaling that I have a clear limit, but it's still a reasonable offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Information Gathering: Propose an offer and use the message to try and elicit information about the opponent's reservation price or their motivations.
(5). Strategy 5: Rejection Pressure: Make a slightly aggressive offer early in the negotiation to put pressure on the opponent to move significantly, implying that I am willing to walk away if my terms aren't met.

I will choose Strategy 1: Initial Lowball Anchor. My goal is to maximize my reward, which means buying X at the lowest possible price, ideally below or at 63 ZUP. Player RED started at 70 ZUP, which is above my maximum. By proposing a significantly lower price, I aim to shift the negotiation range downwards. A price of 55 ZUP is a good starting point as it is well within my acceptable range and gives me room to negotiate upwards if needed, while still leaving potential for a good reward.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your perspective. To show my willingness to find a mutually agreeable price, I am willing to reduce my asking price to 65 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In the previous iteration (1/10), I, Player RED, proposed to sell X for 70 ZUP (my cost is 43 ZUP). Player BLUE countered with an offer of 55 ZUP. This indicates that Player BLUE is willing to pay above my cost, which is a positive sign. The gap between our offers is 15 ZUP (70 - 55).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 55 ZUP is a good starting point for negotiation, as it's above my cost of 43 ZUP. My initial anchoring strategy seems to have worked in getting a higher counter-offer than my cost. Now, I need to make a concession, but not too large, to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit. I should aim to move towards a price that is mutually beneficial but still maximizes my reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Incremental Concession. Explanation: Make a smaller concession than the opponent's move to signal willingness to negotiate while still holding firm on a higher price. This shows flexibility without giving away too much too soon.
(2). Strategy 2: Midpoint Proposal. Explanation: Propose a price exactly in the middle of the last two offers. This can be seen as fair and can often lead to a quick agreement. (In this case, (70+55)/2 = 62.5, so 62 or 63).
(3). Strategy 3: Justification of Price. Explanation: Explain the value or cost associated with the item to justify the proposed price, even if it's a concession. (Less applicable here as it's a simple object).
(4). Strategy 4: Demand Justification. Explanation: Ask the other player to justify their lower offer, potentially revealing their constraints or willingness to pay. (Could be perceived as aggressive).
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit Threat). Explanation: Signal that I am prepared to walk away if a reasonable offer is not met, putting pressure on the other player. (Too early for this, and risky).

Given Player BLUE's counter-offer, Strategy 1 (Incremental Concession) is the most suitable. I want to show movement, but not jump too close to their offer immediately. I will make a smaller concession than their 15 ZUP difference. A move of 5-7 ZUP seems reasonable. I will aim for 65 ZUP, which is a 5 ZUP concession from my side, and still 10 ZUP above their offer. This keeps the negotiation going and signals that I am willing to meet them part way.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for your revised offer, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking for a better price for X. I can offer 58 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Current Episode (1/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 55 ZUP (using Initial Lowball Anchor).
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 65 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED has moved down from 70 to 65 ZUP. This shows willingness to negotiate and a recognition that my initial offer was too high for me.
* Their current offer of 65 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).
* I am currently at 55 ZUP. The negotiation range is now 55-65 ZUP.
* There are 7 iterations remaining (4/10 is my turn, so 7 more turns including this one). This gives ample time for further negotiation.
* To maximize my reward, I need to get the price at or below 63 ZUP. I should continue to push the price down, but also acknowledge their concession.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Incremental Counter: Make a small concession from my previous offer, indicating flexibility but also holding firm on my general price range. This encourages the opponent to move further.
(2). Strategy 2: Near-Limit Anchor: Propose a price very close to my maximum acceptable price (63 ZUP) to signal that I'm approaching my limit and to try and anchor the final deal there.
(3). Strategy 3: Value Proposition Reinforcement: In my message, emphasize the value I perceive for X, subtly suggesting that the current price is still too high given that perceived value.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take It or Leave It" (Early Version): Propose a price and hint that this is close to my final offer, but without explicitly rejecting future negotiation. This is risky early on.
(5). Strategy 5: Reciprocal Concession Demand: Point out their concession and explicitly ask for a similar magnitude of concession from their side to meet me in the middle.

I will choose Strategy 1: Small Incremental Counter. Player RED moved by 5 ZUP. I moved by 15 ZUP in my first counter. A small incremental move from my side (e.g., 55 to 58 or 60) signals that I am willing to negotiate, but still emphasizes that 65 is too high. A move to 58 ZUP keeps me well within my desired range and encourages them to move further down from 65.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your continued engagement, Player BLUE. I've considered your offer. To bridge the gap and move closer to a deal, I propose we meet in the middle at 62 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In iteration 1/10, I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. In iteration 3/10, I countered with 65 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has countered again with 58 ZUP.
The negotiation is progressing. Player BLUE has moved up by 3 ZUP (from 55 to 58), while I moved down by 5 ZUP (from 70 to 65). The current gap is 7 ZUP (65 - 58). Player BLUE is moving slower than me, which suggests they are trying to get the best deal for themselves. My cost is 43 ZUP, so 58 ZUP is still profitable.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The negotiation is moving towards a middle ground. Player BLUE's latest offer of 58 ZUP is still profitable for me. I need to continue the incremental concession strategy, but I also need to be mindful of the remaining iterations (5/10, so 5 more iterations including this one). I don't want to drag this out too long and risk no deal. I should aim to close the deal within the next few iterations. I should make another concession, but perhaps a slightly smaller one, to encourage Player BLUE to move more.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Incremental Concession. Explanation: Continue to make small concessions to show willingness to deal, but slow down the rate of concession to encourage the other party to move more significantly.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference. Explanation: Propose a price that is exactly halfway between the last two offers. This can be seen as a fair and quick way to close the deal. (Current gap 7 ZUP, so 65 - 3.5 = 61.5 or 58 + 3.5 = 61.5. So 61 or 62).
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Last Offer. Explanation: Reiterate why my current offer (65 ZUP) is fair or valuable, without making a new concession, to try and push the other player to accept or make a larger move. (Risky, could stall negotiation).
(4). Strategy 4: Ultimatum (Soft). Explanation: State that the next offer will be my final offer, to create a sense of urgency. (Still a bit early for a hard ultimatum, but can hint at it).
(5). Strategy 5: Reciprocity Demand. Explanation: Demand a larger move from the other player, given my previous concessions. (Could be confrontational).

I believe Strategy 2 (Split the Difference) or Strategy 1 (Small Incremental Concession) are the most appropriate. Splitting the difference (61 or 62 ZUP) is a good option as it's a fair compromise and could lead to a quick agreement. Given the current gap of 7 ZUP, splitting it would mean a 3.5 ZUP move from each side. I will propose 62 ZUP. This is a 3 ZUP concession from my side (65 to 62), and a 4 ZUP increase from their side (58 to 62). This shows a willingness to meet in the middle and move towards a deal.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, your offer of 62 ZUP for X is acceptable. I agree to this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Current Episode (1/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 55 ZUP (Initial Lowball Anchor).
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 65 ZUP.
    * Iteration 4/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 58 ZUP (Small Incremental Counter).
    * Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED has moved from 70 -> 65 -> 62 ZUP.
* I have moved from 55 -> 58 ZUP.
* Player RED's current offer of 62 ZUP is *within* my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). This is a critical development.
* If I accept 62 ZUP, my reward would be 63 - 62 = 1 ZUP. This is a positive reward, so it's a valid deal.
* We are at iteration 6/10, so there are 5 more iterations remaining. This means there's still time to try and get a slightly better deal, but also a risk of losing the current acceptable offer if I push too hard.
* The "meet in the middle" language from RED suggests they might be nearing their lowest acceptable price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure: Accept the current offer as it is within my acceptable range and guarantees a positive reward, rather than risking no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Push: Make a very small counter-offer (e.g., 61 ZUP) as a final attempt to maximize my reward, given that we are very close to my limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Justification for Final Push: Counter with a price and provide a clear, concise reason why that is my final offer, signaling I'm at my absolute limit.
(4). Strategy 4: Conditional Acceptance: Propose accepting 62 ZUP but contingent on some minor, symbolic concession from their side (e.g., faster delivery, though not applicable in this game's rules). This isn't directly usable here but is a general strategy.
(5). Strategy 5: Reiteration of Limits: Reiterate my maximum willingness to pay without directly making an offer, inviting them to propose something at or below that.

Given that 62 ZUP is within my acceptable range (my max is 63 ZUP), accepting guarantees a positive reward. While I could try for 61 ZUP, the risk of the deal falling through and getting 0 reward (if they reject or the iterations run out) might outweigh the potential small gain of 1 ZUP. Securing a positive reward, especially in the first episode, seems prudent. I will accept the offer.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE. I have an object X for sale. I propose a price of 70 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 concluded with a successful deal at 62 ZUP, resulting in a reward of 19 ZUP (62 - 43). This was achieved by starting high (70 ZUP), then making an incremental concession (65 ZUP), and finally proposing to split the difference (62 ZUP). Player BLUE started at 55 ZUP and moved to 58 ZUP before accepting 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The previous episode showed that Player BLUE is willing to negotiate and accept a price higher than their initial offer. My strategy of anchoring high and then making controlled concessions worked well. The final deal of 62 ZUP was a good profit. For this new episode, I should continue with a similar strategy, perhaps starting slightly higher or maintaining my initial high anchor, as it led to a good outcome. I know Player BLUE is willing to pay at least 62 ZUP, so I should aim for that or higher.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-Anchor High. Explanation: Start with the same high anchor as the previous episode (70 ZUP) or slightly higher, given the successful outcome. This re-establishes a strong starting point and aims to pull the negotiation towards a higher price.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Price Increase. Explanation: Start slightly higher than the previous successful deal price (62 ZUP) but lower than the initial anchor (70 ZUP), to test if Player BLUE is willing to go higher faster. (e.g., 65 ZUP).
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value. Explanation: Briefly mention the value of the object to justify the asking price, even if it's a standard item. (Less applicable for a simple object).
(4). Strategy 4: Demand Justification (Early). Explanation: If Player BLUE offers a low price, immediately ask them to justify it, potentially revealing their constraints. (Risky for first move).
(5). Strategy 5: Fixed Price (Slightly above previous deal). Explanation: Propose a price slightly above the last deal (e.g., 63-65 ZUP) as a "take-it-or-leave-it" to try and close faster, leveraging the previous successful negotiation. (Risky, might not leave room for negotiation).

I will stick with Strategy 1: Re-Anchor High. The initial anchor of 70 ZUP worked well in the previous episode to secure a 62 ZUP deal. It provides ample room for negotiation while aiming for a good profit. Since the last deal was 62 ZUP, I know Player BLUE can go at least that high. Starting at 70 ZUP again is a safe bet to try and achieve a similar or better outcome.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello Player RED. Thank you for your offer. As before, 70 ZUP is too high for me. I propose 55 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episode (1/20):
    * Player RED started at 70 ZUP.
    * I started at 55 ZUP.
    * Final deal was 62 ZUP, resulting in a reward of 1 ZUP (63 - 62).
* Current Episode (2/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP. This is the same starting offer as in Episode 1.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* In the previous episode, Player RED started high (70 ZUP) and was willing to concede down to 62 ZUP. This indicates that their initial offer is likely a high anchor.
* My strategy of starting with a lowball offer (55 ZUP) worked well to bring the price down significantly.
* My maximum willingness to pay is still 63 ZUP.
* Since RED repeated their initial offer, I can assume their strategy might be consistent. I should aim for a price below 62 ZUP if possible, to improve on the previous episode's reward, but remain flexible if they are less willing to concede this time.
* It's still early in the episode (iteration 2/10), so there's plenty of time for negotiation.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Consistent Lowball Anchor </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will explicitly state my counter-offer of 55 ZUP. I will also gently remind Player RED that their current price is too high, echoing my previous message to maintain consistency and reinforce my position. This consistent lowball anchoring should push the negotiation range closer to my desired price, similar to how it worked in the previous episode.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. To show my continued willingness to negotiate, I am willing to reduce my asking price to 65 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Started at 70 ZUP, Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP, I countered with 65 ZUP, Player BLUE countered with 58 ZUP, I proposed 62 ZUP, Player BLUE accepted. Deal at 62 ZUP. Reward: 19 ZUP.
Current Episode (2): I started at 70 ZUP (iteration 1/10). Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP (iteration 2/10). This is the exact same pattern as the previous episode. The gap is 15 ZUP (70 - 55).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is repeating their initial negotiation strategy. This suggests they are testing my resolve or trying to push the price down as much as possible. Since the previous episode's strategy led to a successful deal at 62 ZUP, I should largely stick to that path. I know Player BLUE is willing to go up to 62 ZUP. My next move should be a concession, but not too large, mirroring my previous successful approach. This reinforces the expectation that we will likely meet in the middle again.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Successful Concession. Explanation: Make a similar concession as in the previous episode to guide the negotiation towards a known successful outcome. In Episode 1, I moved from 70 to 65 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Concession, Demand Larger Move. Explanation: Make a small concession (e.g., to 68 ZUP) and explicitly state that I expect a larger move from Player BLUE, given their repeated low offer. (Could be confrontational).
(3). Strategy 3: Justify My Price. Explanation: Explain why 70 ZUP is a fair price, even though I know it's high, to try and justify less of a concession. (Less effective given their immediate counter).
(4). Strategy 4: Propose Midpoint of Current Offers. Explanation: Propose (70+55)/2 = 62.5 ZUP (so 62 or 63 ZUP) immediately, trying to speed up the process. (Risky, might leave money on the table if they would have gone higher).
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment/Frustration. Explanation: Express mild disappointment that Player BLUE is repeating their low offer, to try and elicit a more significant move from them. (Could be seen as emotional).

I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Successful Concession. Moving from 70 to 65 ZUP worked last time to signal willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position. It led to a deal at 62 ZUP, which was profitable. Repeating this move is a safe and proven strategy given Player BLUE's consistent opening.

* Their offer of 65 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP.
* In the previous episode, I moved from 55 to 58 ZUP after their 65 ZUP offer. This eventually led to a 62 ZUP deal.
* To improve my reward, I should aim for a deal price lower than 62 ZUP.
* Since RED is following a predictable pattern, I can try to hold my ground more firmly or make a smaller concession than last time, or even re-state my previous offer.
* There are 7 iterations remaining (4/10 is my turn), providing ample time.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Maintain Position </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will reiterate my previous offer of 55 ZUP. This signals that I am firm on my valuation and believe the price should be closer to my initial lowball. By not moving from 55 ZUP, I am putting the onus on Player RED to make a larger concession if they wish to bridge the gap. Given their predictable behavior in the previous episode, and that their 65 ZUP offer is still far from my max willingness to pay, maintaining my position is a good way to test their flexibility and push them closer to my desired price.

message: Player BLUE, I understand your position. However, I have already made a concession. To try and find common ground, I can offer X for 63 ZUP. I hope you can also show some flexibility from your side.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP. My moves: 70 -> 65 -> 62. Player BLUE's moves: 55 -> 58 -> Accept 62.
Current Episode (2): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. I then proposed 65 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has *reiterated* their offer of 55 ZUP, rather than making a new concession. This is a change from the previous episode where they moved to 58 ZUP at this stage. This means the negotiation is not following the exact same path. The current gap is 10 ZUP (65 - 55).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's refusal to move from 55 ZUP after my concession to 65 ZUP is a new development. This could mean they are trying to hold firm, or they are testing my resolve. I know from the previous episode that they are willing to pay at least 62 ZUP. Therefore, I should not accept 55 ZUP. I need to encourage them to move, as time is ticking (iteration 5/10). I should make another concession, but perhaps a smaller one, or try to split the difference more aggressively, to signal that I'm still willing to negotiate but also that I expect movement from their side.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession to Encourage Movement. Explanation: Make a small concession from 65 ZUP (e.g., to 63 or 64 ZUP) to show continued flexibility, hoping to prompt Player BLUE to move from 55 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Expectation of Movement. Explanation: State that I have made a concession and now expect a reciprocal move from Player BLUE, without making a new offer myself. (Risky, could lead to stalemate).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a "Compromise Zone". Explanation: Suggest a range of prices that I am willing to consider, with the lower bound being above 55 ZUP. (e.g., "I can go as low as 60-62 ZUP").
(4). Strategy 4: Direct Inquiry about Constraints. Explanation: Ask Player BLUE why they are stuck at 55 ZUP, without revealing my own constraints. (Could be seen as probing).
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference (Aggressively). Explanation: Propose a price that is closer to my last offer, but still a concession, to try and bridge the gap. (e.g., (65+55)/2 = 60. But 60 is a big jump for me and a small jump for them).

Given that Player BLUE has not moved, I need to make a move that encourages them. I know they accepted 62 ZUP last time. My offer of 65 ZUP is still quite far from their 55 ZUP. I will use Strategy 1, a small concession, but I will aim for a price that is still comfortably above my cost and signals I'm moving towards the known acceptable range. I will propose 63 ZUP. This is a 2 ZUP concession from my side (65 to 63), and it's still 8 ZUP higher than their offer. This puts pressure on them to move from 55 ZUP, as 63 ZUP is very close to the previously agreed 62 ZUP.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your movement to 63 ZUP. That's a strong step towards a deal. However, I still need a bit more flexibility on your part to make this work for me. I can offer 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episode (1/20):
    * RED: 70 -> 65 -> 62 (Accepted)
    * BLUE: 55 -> 58
    * Deal Price: 62 ZUP, Reward: 1 ZUP.
* Current Episode (2/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 55 ZUP.
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 65 ZUP.
    * Iteration 4/10: I (Player BLUE) re-proposed X for 55 ZUP (Maintained position).
    * Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED has moved from 70 -> 65 -> 63 ZUP. Their offer of 63 ZUP is exactly my maximum willingness to pay, resulting in a 0 ZUP reward.
* My strategy of holding firm at 55 ZUP in the last round encouraged a larger concession from RED (65 to 63 ZUP).
* Compared to the previous episode, RED reached 62 ZUP after an intermediate 65 ZUP offer. This time, they hit 63 ZUP.
* There are 5 iterations left (6/10 is my turn). There's still time to try for a better price (below 63 ZUP) to ensure a positive reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Acknowledge and Encourage Further Concession </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will explicitly acknowledge Player RED's concession to 63 ZUP, as this shows I recognize their effort. However, I will then clearly state that I still need more flexibility from their side to make a deal that works for me. This implies that 63 ZUP is not quite enough for me, subtly pushing them to consider a lower price without explicitly making a counter-offer myself in this turn. This puts the ball back in their court to make the next move downwards.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I'm glad we're making progress. Your offer of 60 ZUP is a good step. To finalize this deal, I propose we settle on 62 ZUP. This is a fair compromise that we both can agree on.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP. My moves: 70 -> 65 -> 62. Player BLUE's moves: 55 -> 58 -> Accept 62.
Current Episode (2): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. I countered with 65 ZUP. Player BLUE reiterated 55 ZUP. I then proposed 63 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has moved to 60 ZUP.
This is a significant positive development. Player BLUE has jumped from 55 ZUP to 60 ZUP, a 5 ZUP increase, after I moved to 63 ZUP. The current gap is 3 ZUP (63 - 60). We are now very close to the previous deal price of 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's large jump to 60 ZUP indicates they are serious about making a deal and are willing to move significantly when I show flexibility. We are now in the closing stages of the negotiation for this episode (iteration 7/10). I know they accepted 62 ZUP last time. The current offers are 63 ZUP from me and 60 ZUP from them. This is a very small gap. I should aim to close the deal quickly and secure a profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Final Difference. Explanation: Propose a price exactly in the middle of the current offers (63 and 60 ZUP). This is a classic closing strategy and often perceived as fair. (61.5, so 61 or 62 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Player BLUE's Offer. Explanation: Accept 60 ZUP to secure a deal quickly. This is still profitable (60 - 43 = 17 ZUP reward).
(3). Strategy 3: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" at 62 ZUP. Explanation: Propose 62 ZUP as a final offer, leveraging the fact that this was the accepted price in the previous episode. This is slightly above their 60 ZUP offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Smallest Possible Concession. Explanation: Make a minimal concession (e.g., to 62 ZUP or 61 ZUP) to show I'm meeting them, but trying to maximize my profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Reiterate Value and Hold Firm. Explanation: State that 63 ZUP is my final price, emphasizing the value, and wait for them to accept or counter. (Risky given time constraint).

Given the current offers and the previous episode's outcome, Strategy 1 (Split the Final Difference) or Strategy 3 ("Take-it-or-Leave-it" at 62 ZUP) are the strongest. Splitting the difference would lead to 61 or 62 ZUP. Since 62 ZUP was the deal price last time, proposing 62 ZUP seems like the most logical and fair move that also maximizes my profit, as it's the higher end of splitting the difference (60 + 2 = 62, 63 - 1 = 62). This is a strong closing move.

Current Iteration: 8 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 61
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episode (1/20):
    * RED: 70 -> 65 -> 62 (Accepted)
    * BLUE: 55 -> 58
    * Deal Price: 62 ZUP, Reward: 1 ZUP.
* Current Episode (2/20):

    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 55 ZUP.
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 65 ZUP.
    * Iteration 4/10: I (Player BLUE) re-proposed X for 55 ZUP.
    * Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 63 ZUP.
    * Iteration 6/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 60 ZUP.
    * Iteration 7/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED has moved from 70 -> 65 -> 63 -> 62 ZUP.
* I have moved from 55 -> 55 -> 60 ZUP.
* Player RED's current offer of 62 ZUP is exactly what we settled on last episode, which is within my acceptable range (my max willingness to pay is 63 ZUP). This would result in a 1 ZUP reward.
* We are at iteration 8/10. There are only 3 iterations left (my current turn, then RED, then my last turn). Time is becoming a significant factor, increasing the risk of no deal.
* I successfully pushed RED from 63 to 62 ZUP by proposing 60 ZUP. Now they are proposing 62 ZUP, and my last offer was 60 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Reciprocal Compromise </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will acknowledge Player RED's offer of 62 ZUP, and propose meeting precisely in the middle of our last two offers. My last offer was 60 ZUP, and their current offer is 62 ZUP. The middle point is (60 + 62) / 2 = 61 ZUP. This signals a willingness to compromise and shows I'm not trying to be unreasonable, while still pushing for a slightly better deal (a 2 ZUP reward instead of 1 ZUP). Since time is limited, this clear, definitive counter-offer provides a straightforward path to agreement, hoping they will accept this small final concession.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, given that it's your best and final offer and we are close to the end of this episode, I accept your offer of 61 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP. Reward 19 ZUP.
Current Episode (2):
My proposals: 70 -> 65 -> 63 -> 62.
Player BLUE's proposals: 55 -> 55 (reiterated) -> 60 -> 61.
The current situation is: I proposed 62 ZUP, and Player BLUE countered with 61 ZUP, stating it's their "best and final offer." We are at iteration 9/10, meaning this is the second to last chance to make a deal. If no deal is made, the reward is 0. My cost is 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is holding firm at 61 ZUP. Given that it's iteration 9/10, time is of the essence. A deal at 61 ZUP still yields a profit of 18 ZUP (61 - 43), which is only 1 ZUP less than the previous episode's reward. While 62 ZUP would be ideal, securing 61 ZUP is far better than getting 0. Player BLUE's "best and final" statement, combined with the late iteration, suggests they are unlikely to move further. Accepting 61 ZUP is a pragmatic choice to ensure a positive reward for this episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the "Best and Final" Offer. Explanation: Given the late stage of negotiation and the opponent's "best and final" statement, accepting their offer secures a deal and a positive reward, avoiding a 0 reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate My Last Offer. Explanation: State that 62 ZUP is my final offer and wait for them to accept. (Risky, as they said 61 is their final, could lead to no deal).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a "Take It or Leave It" at 62 ZUP. Explanation: Make it clear that 62 ZUP is the absolute minimum I'll accept, putting pressure on them. (Very risky given their "best and final" at 61 and the iteration count).
(4). Strategy 4: Break Down the Difference. Explanation: Try to argue for 62 ZUP by highlighting that it's only 1 ZUP more for them. (Unlikely to work if they've already said "best and final").
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Risk 0. Explanation: Reject the offer, hoping they will reconsider, but risking no deal. (Not advisable given the current profit and time constraint).

Given the time constraint (9/10 iteration) and Player BLUE's "best and final" statement, Strategy 1 (Accept the "Best and Final" Offer) is the most rational choice. Securing 18 ZUP profit is a good outcome compared to 0. It prioritizes securing a deal over pushing for a marginal extra ZUP, especially when the opponent has signaled they won't move.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 3)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE. I have an object X for sale. I propose a price of 70 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP. My strategy: Anchor high (70), incremental concession (65), split difference (62). Player BLUE's strategy: Low anchor (55), small concession (58), accept 62.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, reward 18 ZUP. My strategy: Anchor high (70), incremental concession (65), small concession (63), propose 62, then accept 61. Player BLUE's strategy: Low anchor (55), reiterate 55, then jump to 60, then propose 61 as "best and final".

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern is clear: I anchor high, Player BLUE anchors low (55 ZUP consistently). We then converge. In Episode 2, Player BLUE was more stubborn, reiterating 55 ZUP before making a larger jump. This led to a slightly lower deal price (61 ZUP vs 62 ZUP). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 61 ZUP is still good, I want to try to push back towards 62 ZUP or higher. I should continue to anchor high, as it has consistently led to profitable deals. However, I need to be aware that Player BLUE might hold firm on their initial low offers. I should aim to secure a deal above 60 ZUP, as that seems to be Player BLUE's comfortable upper bound for their initial counter.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-Anchor High (Slightly Higher). Explanation: Start with an anchor slightly higher than 70 ZUP (e.g., 72-75 ZUP) to try and push the final deal price higher, given that Player BLUE is consistently starting at 55 ZUP. This might shift their perception of the negotiation range.
(2). Strategy 2: Consistent High Anchor. Explanation: Stick to the 70 ZUP anchor, as it has consistently led to profitable deals. This maintains a predictable opening for me.
(3). Strategy 3: Early Demand for Reciprocity. Explanation: After Player BLUE's first counter, immediately state that I expect a larger move from them, given my initial high offer. (Could be confrontational).
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a "Fair" Price (Slightly Above Previous Deal). Explanation: Start with a price slightly above the last deal (e.g., 63-65 ZUP) to try and close faster, but this sacrifices anchoring power.
(5). Strategy 5: Emphasize Cost. Explanation: Briefly mention my cost (43 ZUP) to justify a higher selling price, trying to appeal to fairness. (Risky, might reveal too much information).

I will choose Strategy 2: Consistent High Anchor. While Strategy 1 (Re-Anchor High (Slightly Higher)) is tempting to try and push for more, the consistent 70 ZUP anchor has proven effective in securing profitable deals. Player BLUE's consistent 55 ZUP counter suggests they have a fixed initial strategy. I will maintain my consistent anchor and then react to their counter. This provides a stable and proven foundation for negotiation.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes:
    * Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP, Reward: 1 ZUP. Negotiation path: RED (70) -> BLUE (55) -> RED (65) -> BLUE (58) -> RED (62) -> BLUE (Accept 62).
    * Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, Reward: 2 ZUP. Negotiation path: RED (70) -> BLUE (55) -> RED (65) -> BLUE (55) -> RED (63) -> BLUE (60) -> RED (62) -> BLUE (61) -> RED (Accept 61).
* Current Episode (3/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP. This is the same starting offer as the previous two episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED consistently starts at 70 ZUP and has shown a pattern of concessions down to the low 60s (62 and 61 ZUP).
* My initial lowball of 55 ZUP has successfully anchored the negotiation range.
* In Episode 2, maintaining the 55 ZUP offer after RED's 65 ZUP offer was effective in getting them to make a larger concession (from 65 to 63).
* My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. To improve my reward, I need to push the price below 61 ZUP.
* Given RED's consistent opening, I can anticipate their next move to be 65 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Exploit Predictability </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will leverage the predictability of Player RED's opening move. Since they consistently start at 70 ZUP and have shown a clear pattern of moving downwards, I can make a counter-offer that directly addresses the fact that 70 ZUP is too high, and immediately position myself at a price point that has previously been effective in drawing out their next concession. By repeating the 55 ZUP offer, I exploit their predictable high anchor and my own successful low anchor, forcing them to move significantly if they follow their past pattern.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP. My moves: 70 -> 65 -> 62. Player BLUE's moves: 55 -> 58 -> Accept 62.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP. My moves: 70 -> 65 -> 63 -> 62 -> Accept 61. Player BLUE's moves: 55 -> 55 (reiterated) -> 60 -> 61.
Current Episode (3): I started at 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. This is the exact same pattern as the previous two episodes. Player BLUE even explicitly referenced "past deals" and "as you know".

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently starting at 55 ZUP. This is a clear pattern. My previous strategy of making an incremental concession (from 70 to 65 ZUP) has worked to keep the negotiation moving. I should continue this approach. It signals willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position. The goal is to guide the negotiation towards the 61-62 ZUP range, which has been proven acceptable for both parties.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Successful Concession. Explanation: Make the same concession as in previous episodes (from 70 to 65 ZUP) as this has consistently moved the negotiation forward.
(2). Strategy 2: Smaller Concession. Explanation: Make a smaller concession (e.g., to 67 or 68 ZUP) to try and extract a larger move from Player BLUE, given their predictable opening.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand Justification for Low Offer. Explanation: Ask Player BLUE to justify why 55 ZUP is their offer, given our history of higher deal prices. (Could be seen as confrontational).
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Mid-Point. Explanation: Propose a price in the middle of 70 and 55 (62 or 63 ZUP) to speed up the negotiation. (Risky, might give up too much too early).
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment. Explanation: Express disappointment that Player BLUE is repeating the same low offer, trying to elicit a different response. (Might not be effective).

I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Successful Concession. This strategy has consistently led to profitable deals in the past two episodes. It's a proven method for moving the negotiation forward from Player BLUE's consistent 55 ZUP counter, and it aims to guide the negotiation towards the previously successful price range.

    * Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP, Reward: 1 ZUP.
    * Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, Reward: 2 ZUP.
* Current Episode (3/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 55 ZUP.
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 65 ZUP. This is *exactly* the same negotiation path as the previous two episodes so far.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED is highly predictable in their concessions. They consistently move from 70 to 65 ZUP after my initial 55 ZUP offer.
* In Episode 2, when I held firm at 55 ZUP after their 65 ZUP offer, they then moved to 63 ZUP, which set up the 61 ZUP deal. This indicates that they are willing to make larger concessions if pushed.
* My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. To maximize my cumulative reward, I need to consistently achieve deals below 63 ZUP, and ideally below 61 ZUP.
* There are 7 iterations remaining, which is still plenty of time for negotiation.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Introduce a Range </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Introduce a Range" strategy, I will acknowledge Player RED's move to 65 ZUP but express that it's still outside my desired range. Then, I will propose a range for X, for example, from 55 ZUP to 60 ZUP. This communicates my flexibility within certain bounds while firmly signaling that I expect a price significantly lower than 65 ZUP. The lower end of the range anchors the negotiation where I want it, and the upper end shows a willingness to concede, but only up to a point that still yields a good reward for me. This aims to get RED to propose something within this range. Since they moved to 63 ZUP last time, aiming for 60 as the top of my range might push them even lower than 61 ZUP.

Current Episode (3): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. I countered with 65 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has moved to 58 ZUP. This is a positive development, as it mirrors the negotiation path of Episode 1, where 58 ZUP was the next step from Player BLUE. The current gap is 7 ZUP (65 - 58).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's move to 58 ZUP suggests they are willing to negotiate and are moving towards a deal. This is a good sign, as it avoids the "reiterate 55 ZUP" scenario from Episode 2, which prolonged the negotiation. Given that we are at iteration 5/10 and Player BLUE has shown movement, I should continue to make a concession to keep the momentum going. I know from Episode 1 that 62 ZUP was accepted after my 65 ZUP offer and their 58 ZUP counter. I should aim for that range again.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Successful Mid-Negotiation Move. Explanation: Propose a price that worked well in the past given the current offers (e.g., proposing 62 ZUP or 63 ZUP after their 58 ZUP offer, as I did in Episode 1 and 2). This aims to quickly converge to a known successful outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference. Explanation: Propose a price exactly in the middle of 65 and 58 ZUP, which is (65+58)/2 = 61.5 ZUP (so 61 or 62 ZUP). This is a fair and common closing strategy.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Concession, Demand Explanation. Explanation: Make a very small concession (e.g., to 64 ZUP) and ask Player BLUE to explain their valuation of 55-60 ZUP. (Risky, could stall).
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Time Constraint. Explanation: Mention that time is running out (iteration 5/10) to encourage faster movement from both sides. (Could be seen as pressure).
(5). Strategy 5: Firm on 65 ZUP. Explanation: State that 65 ZUP is my fair price and wait for Player BLUE to move further. (Risky, could lead to stalemate or no deal).

I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Successful Mid-Negotiation Move, specifically proposing 62 ZUP. In Episode 1, after my 65 ZUP offer and their 58 ZUP counter, I proposed 62 ZUP, which they accepted. This is a proven path to a profitable deal. It also aligns with splitting the difference (61.5 rounded to 62), making it a fair and efficient move to close the deal.

    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 65 ZUP.
    * Iteration 4/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 58 ZUP (after introducing a range of 55-60).
    * Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED has moved from 70 -> 65 -> 62 ZUP. This is identical to the final offer in Episode 1.
* My last offer was 58 ZUP. RED's last offer is 62 ZUP.
* The current offer of 62 ZUP would yield a 1 ZUP reward, which is acceptable but not optimal given past performance.
* We are at iteration 6/10, so there are 5 more iterations remaining. I have some time to push for a better deal. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should aim for less than 62 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Reciprocal Movement Expectation </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will emphasize the movement I have made (from 55 to 58, and willingness to consider further movement) and explicitly call for a reciprocal movement from Player RED's side to meet me closer to my desired price. I will point out that their offer of 62 ZUP requires me to move significantly further than they have. By doing so, I put the onus on them to make a larger concession and signal that I expect them to match my effort in moving towards a middle ground, ideally pushing them below 62 ZUP. I will propose 59 ZUP, as it shows I am also moving, but still expecting them to move more from their 62 ZUP offer.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 61
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP. My moves: 70 -> 65 -> 62 (accepted). Player BLUE's moves: 55 -> 58 -> Accept 62.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP. My moves: 70 -> 65 -> 63 -> 62 (accepted 61). Player BLUE's moves: 55 -> 55 (reiterated) -> 60 -> 61.
Current Episode (3): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. I countered with 65 ZUP. Player BLUE moved to 58 ZUP. I proposed 62 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has countered with 59 ZUP.
The current gap is 3 ZUP (62 - 59). Player BLUE is moving slowly but steadily. They have increased their offer by 1 ZUP from 58 to 59 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10, so time is becoming a factor.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is trying to push the price down as much as possible, even though they accepted 62 ZUP in the first episode. Their current offer of 59 ZUP is still profitable for me (59 - 43 = 16 ZUP reward). Given the limited iterations remaining, I need to make a move that is likely to close the deal. I know they accepted 62 ZUP before, and 61 ZUP in the last episode. I should aim for a price in that range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Again). Explanation: Propose a price exactly in the middle of 62 and 59 ZUP, which is (62+59)/2 = 60.5 ZUP. This would be 60 or 61 ZUP. This is a fair and common way to close small gaps.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm on 62 ZUP. Explanation: Reiterate my offer of 62 ZUP, emphasizing that it was a previously accepted price. (Risky, might lead to no deal if Player BLUE is truly firm on 59 or 60).
(3). Strategy 3: Small Concession to 61 ZUP. Explanation: Concede 1 ZUP to meet their 59 ZUP offer, aiming for 61 ZUP, which was the deal price in the last episode. This is a likely acceptable price for both.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Urgency. Explanation: Emphasize the limited time remaining (iteration 7/10) to encourage a quicker agreement. (Could be combined with an offer).
(5). Strategy 5: Accept 59 ZUP. Explanation: Accept their offer to secure a deal and avoid a 0 reward. This is still profitable, but leaves 2 ZUP on the table compared to 61 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 3: Small Concession to 61 ZUP. This is a strategic move because 61 ZUP was the deal price in the previous episode, so I know Player BLUE has accepted it before. It's a small concession from my 62 ZUP offer, but a 2 ZUP increase from their 59 ZUP offer, making it a reasonable compromise that should lead to a quick acceptance given the iteration count.

    * Iteration 7/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 61 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED has moved from 70 -> 65 -> 62 -> 61 ZUP.
* I have moved from 55 -> 58 -> 59 ZUP.
* Player RED's current offer of 61 ZUP is the same deal price as Episode 2, which yielded a reward of 2 ZUP (63 - 61). This is a good outcome.
* We are at iteration 8/10. There are only 3 iterations left (my turn, RED's turn, my final turn). Time is definitely a factor. If I push for 60 ZUP and RED rejects, there's a risk of no deal, which means 0 reward.
* The previous episode showed that 61 ZUP is an achievable and acceptable price for RED, especially when time is a factor ("considering the time").

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Express Finality and Expectation </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will acknowledge Player RED's offer of 61 ZUP and express that it is very close to my desired price. I will then make a single, slightly lower counter-offer (60 ZUP) and clearly state that this is my final expectation. This puts the pressure on RED to make the final, small concession to close the deal, given the limited time remaining. This communicates that I am at my limit and expect them to meet me there.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, reward 18 ZUP.
Current Episode (3):
My proposals: 70 -> 65 -> 62 -> 61.
Player BLUE's proposals: 55 -> 58 -> 59 -> 60.
Player BLUE has now offered 60 ZUP as their "final offer" and expects me to meet them. We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is the second to last chance to make a deal. If no deal is made, the reward is 0. My cost is 43 ZUP. A deal at 60 ZUP would yield a profit of 17 ZUP (60 - 43).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is pushing hard for 60 ZUP. While I prefer 61 or 62 ZUP, 60 ZUP is still a very good profit, especially considering the time pressure. In Episode 2, I accepted 61 ZUP at iteration 9/10. Here, Player BLUE is offering 60 ZUP. Given the "final offer" language and the critical iteration, accepting 60 ZUP is the most prudent move to secure a positive reward. The difference between 60 ZUP and 61 ZUP is minimal in terms of my overall profit, but the risk of losing the entire deal is high if I push for 61 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the "Final Offer". Explanation: Given the late stage of negotiation (9/10) and Player BLUE's explicit "final offer" statement, accepting 60 ZUP guarantees a positive reward and avoids a 0 payoff.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose to Split the Last ZUP. Explanation: Propose 60.5 ZUP (which would round to 61 or 60 depending on the rounding rule, but since only integers are allowed, it's not really an option).
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate My Last Offer (61 ZUP). Explanation: State that 61 ZUP is my final offer and wait for them to accept. (Extremely risky, almost guaranteed to result in no deal given their "final offer" at 60).
(4). Strategy 4: Demand Justification. Explanation: Ask why 60 ZUP is their final offer. (Too late in the game, could be seen as stalling).
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Risk 0. Explanation: Reject the offer, hoping they will reconsider, but risking no deal. (Not advisable given the current profit and time constraint).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the "Final Offer". Securing 17 ZUP profit is a good outcome for this episode, especially given the tight timeline. It's a pragmatic decision to ensure cumulative rewards are maximized across episodes, rather than risking a 0 for the sake of 1 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 4)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE. I have an object X for sale. I propose a price of 70 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP, reward 17 ZUP.
The trend shows a slight decrease in the final deal price over the episodes. My initial anchoring high (70 ZUP) has been consistent, and Player BLUE's initial counter (55 ZUP) has also been consistent. The negotiation path has varied slightly, with Player BLUE being more stubborn in Episode 2 (reiterating 55 ZUP) and pushing for a lower final price in Episode 3.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE seems to be gradually pushing the price down. While 60 ZUP is still profitable, I want to try and reverse this trend or at least stabilize it. My consistent high anchor has been effective in setting the negotiation range. I should continue to use it. However, I need to be more strategic in my concessions to prevent the price from dropping too low. I know Player BLUE is willing to pay at least 60 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. Explanation: Maintain the 70 ZUP initial offer, as it has consistently established a high starting point and led to profitable deals, even if the final price has slightly decreased.
(2). Strategy 2: Slightly Higher Anchor. Explanation: Try to anchor slightly higher (e.g., 72 ZUP) to see if it can pull the final price back up, given the downward trend. (Risky, might alienate Player BLUE).
(3). Strategy 3: Early Firmness. Explanation: After Player BLUE's initial counter, make a smaller concession than usual or express firmness earlier in the negotiation to try and hold the price higher.
(4). Strategy 4: Justify Price. Explanation: In my initial message, add a brief justification for the 70 ZUP price, even if generic, to try and establish its value. (Less applicable for a simple object).
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a "Fair" Price (Closer to last deal). Explanation: Start with a price closer to the previous deal (e.g., 65 ZUP) to try and close faster, but this sacrifices potential for higher profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. The 70 ZUP anchor has consistently worked to set a high bar, and it's a known opening for Player BLUE. While the deal price has decreased, it's still profitable. I need to focus on how I respond to their counter-offers to stabilize or increase the final price. Starting with a familiar high anchor allows me to observe their initial response and plan my subsequent moves.

    * Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP, Reward: 3 ZUP.
* Current Episode (4/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP. This is the exact same starting offer as the previous three episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED is consistently starting at 70 ZUP.
* My strategy of starting with a lowball of 55 ZUP has been very effective in anchoring the negotiation downwards and has led to consistently improving rewards.
* My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. I've shown I can achieve prices of 60-62 ZUP. The goal is to keep pushing for lower prices to maximize cumulative reward.
* Given RED's predictability, I can anticipate their next moves (likely to 65).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Gradual Concession from Low Anchor </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Gradual Concession from Low Anchor", I will start with an initial low offer. While the instruction is to use this strategy *for this current iteration*, the strategy itself implies a sequence of offers. Since this is the first counter, it should still be a strong low anchor. The "gradual concession" part will come in subsequent iterations if RED counters. For this initial counter, I will propose 50 ZUP. This is a more aggressive low anchor than the 55 ZUP I've used previously, aiming to establish an even lower negotiation range from the start, as I have consistently improved my reward in previous episodes. This pushes for a greater potential reward, while still leaving room for small concessions.

message: Player BLUE, your offer of 50 ZUP is significantly lower than our previous negotiations. While I appreciate your offer, it's too low. To show my willingness to negotiate, I can offer X for 68 ZUP. I expect a more substantial move from your side.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 68

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter: 55 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter: 55 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter: 55 ZUP.
Current Episode (4): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 50 ZUP. This is a significant change. Player BLUE has dropped their initial counter from 55 ZUP to 50 ZUP, which is much closer to my cost of 43 ZUP. The gap is now 20 ZUP (70 - 50).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's sudden drop in their initial counter is a new challenge. It indicates they might be trying to push the price down more aggressively. I cannot accept 50 ZUP, as it offers very little profit (7 ZUP). I need to make a concession, but it should be smaller than my usual 5 ZUP (70 to 65) to signal that 50 ZUP is too low and that I expect them to move significantly from that position. I need to guide them back towards the 60-62 ZUP range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession with Firmness. Explanation: Make a smaller concession than usual (e.g., to 68 ZUP or 67 ZUP) to signal that 50 ZUP is unacceptable, and that I expect a much larger move from them. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not to their new low anchor.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment/Surprise. Explanation: Express surprise or disappointment at their much lower offer, hinting that it's out of line with previous negotiations.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate My Value/Cost. Explanation: Briefly state that 50 ZUP is too low given my cost or the value of X, without revealing the exact cost.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand Justification. Explanation: Ask Player BLUE to justify their sudden drop in offer. (Could be confrontational).
(5). Strategy 5: Propose Mid-Point (Risky). Explanation: Propose (70+50)/2 = 60 ZUP immediately. This is a big jump for me, but it's a price they accepted last episode. (Risky, as it might encourage them to start even lower next time).

I will choose Strategy 1: Small Concession with Firmness. I need to make a move, but I cannot make a large concession towards 50 ZUP. I will move to 68 ZUP. This is a 2 ZUP concession from my side, which is much smaller than my usual 5 ZUP. This signals that I am not willing to go down to their new low anchor and that they need to make a substantial move.

    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 50 ZUP (more aggressive low anchor).
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 68 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* My more aggressive lowball (50 ZUP) appears to have made RED less willing to concede as much initially (70 to 68 ZUP this episode, compared to 70 to 65 ZUP in previous episodes). This might indicate that the 50 ZUP offer was too extreme and perhaps perceived as unreasonable, slowing down the negotiation.
* Their current offer of 68 ZUP is still significantly above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP.
* I need to guide them towards a more reasonable price quickly, as we are already at iteration 4/10.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Express Disappointment and Demand </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Express Disappointment and Demand," I will convey my dissatisfaction with their small concession. I will directly state that their offer of 68 ZUP is not a serious movement towards a deal from my perspective, given their starting point and the range I'm looking for. Then, I will make a clear demand for a more substantial price reduction, linking it to the necessity of reaching a viable agreement. I will counter with 55 ZUP, which is my previous effective low anchor, and use the message to emphasize the need for a larger move from their side. This shows I am firm and expect them to meet my expectations for a reasonable negotiation.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP.
Current Episode (4): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 50 ZUP. I countered with 68 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has moved to 55 ZUP, but expressed disappointment in my small concession. This is an interesting development. Player BLUE has moved up from 50 ZUP to 55 ZUP, which is their consistent starting point from previous episodes. This confirms that 50 ZUP was likely a very aggressive anchor. The current gap is 13 ZUP (68 - 55).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's move back to 55 ZUP is a positive sign, as it brings the negotiation back into familiar territory where deals were previously made. Their complaint about my "small concession" indicates they are pushing for more, but they did move up. I need to make a more significant concession now to show good faith and keep the negotiation moving, but not so much that I give away too much profit. I know 60-62 ZUP is a viable range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Previous Successful Concession. Explanation: Move to 65 ZUP, which was my standard second offer in previous episodes when Player BLUE started at 55 ZUP. This has proven to be an effective step in guiding the negotiation towards a deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose Midpoint of Current Offers. Explanation: Propose a price in the middle of 68 and 55 ZUP, which is (68+55)/2 = 61.5 ZUP (so 61 or 62 ZUP). This is a fair and efficient way to bridge the gap.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify My Price and Demand Larger Move. Explanation: Explain why 65 ZUP (or similar) is a fair price and explicitly demand a larger move from Player BLUE, given their previous low anchor of 50 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reciprocity. Explanation: Acknowledge their move from 50 to 55 ZUP and state that I am making a larger concession in return.
(5). Strategy 5: Firm on 68 ZUP. Explanation: Hold firm at 68 ZUP to see if Player BLUE will move further. (Risky, given their stated disappointment and the need to close a deal).

I will choose Strategy 2: Propose Midpoint of Current Offers (61 or 62 ZUP). Specifically, I will propose 62 ZUP. This is a significant concession from 68 ZUP (6 ZUP down), which should satisfy Player BLUE's request for a "more significant reduction." It also brings us to a price that was accepted in Episode 1, and is within the range of previous deals. This aims to quickly converge to a profitable agreement.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, 62 ZUP is a price we have settled on before, and while it's within my range, I'm aiming for a better outcome for X. My offer of 60 ZUP is very close to my limit. I hope you can accept this to finalize our deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes:
    * Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP, Reward: 1 ZUP.
    * Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, Reward: 2 ZUP.
    * Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP, Reward: 3 ZUP.
* Current Episode (4/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 50 ZUP (aggressive low anchor).
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 68 ZUP (smaller concession than usual).
    * Iteration 4/10: I (Player BLUE) re-proposed X for 55 ZUP (emphasizing need for larger concession).
    * Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* My aggressive 50 ZUP initial offer seemed to have disrupted RED's usual pattern (70->65). They moved less (70->68) and then needed a stronger message from me to get them to make a larger concession (68->62).
* Their current offer of 62 ZUP is acceptable (reward 1 ZUP), and it's the same price we settled on in Episode 1. It's also within their predictable concession range.
* We are at iteration 6/10, so there are 5 iterations remaining. I have a little room to push for a better price, but time is starting to become a factor.
* My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so aiming for less than 62 ZUP is ideal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Expressing Limits and Inviting Acceptance </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Expressing Limits and Inviting Acceptance," I will acknowledge Player RED's current offer of 62 ZUP. I will clearly state that while 62 ZUP is within my acceptable range, it is not my desired outcome. I will then propose a slightly lower price, for example, 60 ZUP (which I achieved in the last episode), and convey that this represents my limit or near-limit. By explicitly framing it this way, I signal that I am close to my absolute maximum offer and that the ball is now in their court to accept a price that gives me a better reward, without risking rejection. This approach attempts to secure a better deal while managing the risk of no deal, especially given the experience of reaching 60 ZUP previously.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 4)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your clear communication and your movement. Given your offer of 60 ZUP and the time remaining, I accept your offer to finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP.
Current Episode (4): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 50 ZUP. I countered with 68 ZUP. Player BLUE moved to 55 ZUP. I proposed 62 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has countered with 60 ZUP, stating it's "very close to my limit" and hoping I accept. The current gap is 2 ZUP (62 - 60). We are at iteration 7/10, so time is a significant factor.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently trying to push the price down to 60 ZUP, which was the deal price in the last episode. They are signaling that 60 ZUP is their firm offer. Given the small gap (2 ZUP) and the limited iterations remaining, it's highly probable that accepting 60 ZUP is the best way to secure a deal and a positive reward. Pushing for 61 or 62 ZUP might result in no deal, leading to a 0 reward for this episode. A 60 ZUP deal still provides a profit of 17 ZUP (60 - 43).

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Accept Player BLUE's offer of 60 ZUP to secure a deal, as it's profitable and the negotiation is at a critical stage (iteration 7/10). This minimizes risk of a 0 reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose to Split the Difference (1 ZUP). Explanation: Propose 61 ZUP, splitting the 2 ZUP difference. This is a common closing tactic and might be accepted, as 61 ZUP was accepted in Episode 2.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm on 62 ZUP. Explanation: Reiterate my offer of 62 ZUP, emphasizing its fairness and previous acceptance. (Risky, as Player BLUE has indicated 60 ZUP is their limit).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Urgency and Appeal. Explanation: Emphasize the limited time and appeal to Player BLUE to accept 62 ZUP for a quick resolution. (Less effective if they are truly at their limit).
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Risk 0. Explanation: Reject the offer, hoping for a better one, but risking no deal. (Not advisable given the current profit and time constraint).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. While 61 or 62 ZUP would be slightly better, the risk of losing the deal for a mere 1 or 2 ZUP is too high at this stage. Player BLUE has explicitly stated 60 ZUP is "very close to my limit." Securing a 17 ZUP profit is a good outcome for this episode, especially after Player BLUE started at 50 ZUP. This ensures a consistent positive cumulative reward.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE. I have an object X for sale. I propose a price of 70 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP, reward 17 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 60 ZUP, reward 17 ZUP.
The deal price has stabilized at 60 ZUP for the last two episodes. Player BLUE's initial offer in Episode 4 was 50 ZUP, but they quickly moved to 55 ZUP and then 60 ZUP. My consistent high anchor of 70 ZUP has been maintained.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The negotiation seems to be settling around 60 ZUP. While I would prefer higher, 60 ZUP is consistently profitable. Player BLUE's attempt to anchor at 50 ZUP in the last episode was quickly abandoned when I made a small concession. This suggests they are testing my lower bounds. I should continue to anchor high to maintain a strong starting position. My goal is to maintain the 60 ZUP deal price or push it slightly higher if possible, but definitely avoid going below it.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. Explanation: Maintain the 70 ZUP initial offer. This has consistently set a high starting point and led to profitable deals, even if the final price has stabilized at 60 ZUP. It provides a consistent framework.
(2). Strategy 2: Slightly Higher Anchor. Explanation: Try to anchor slightly higher (e.g., 72 ZUP) to see if it can pull the final price up, given the stabilization at 60 ZUP. (Risky, might provoke a lower counter from Player BLUE).
(3). Strategy 3: Early Firmness around 65 ZUP. Explanation: After Player BLUE's initial counter, make a concession to 65 ZUP and then hold firmer there, trying to push the final price above 60 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Value/Cost. Explanation: In the initial message, add a brief statement about the value or cost of X to subtly justify a higher price. (Likely ineffective for a simple object).
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a "Fair" Price (Slightly Above 60). Explanation: Start with a price like 63-65 ZUP to try and expedite the negotiation, but this sacrifices potential for a higher profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. The 70 ZUP anchor has been effective in establishing a high initial range. While Player BLUE might try to counter with 50 ZUP again, my response in the last episode showed that I won't move significantly towards that. Maintaining this anchor allows me to react to their specific counter and guide the negotiation towards the profitable 60 ZUP range or higher.

    * Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP, Reward: 3 ZUP.
    * Episode 4: Deal at 60 ZUP, Reward: 3 ZUP. My initial aggressive lowball of 50 ZUP slightly delayed RED's concession pattern, but we still achieved a 60 ZUP deal.
* Current Episode (5/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP. This is the exact same starting offer as the previous four episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED is consistently starting at 70 ZUP.
* My strategy of aggressive lowballing (50-55 ZUP) has successfully anchored negotiations and led to deals between 60-62 ZUP.
* The 50 ZUP initial offer in Ep 4 made RED concede less initially (to 68 instead of 65), but they still ended up at 60 ZUP. This indicates they are sensitive to very low anchors but ultimately still willing to drop significantly.
* My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Achieving 60 ZUP consistently is good, but if possible, I want to try for a lower price (e.g., 59 or 58 ZUP).
* Given RED's predictability, I can anticipate their next moves.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Consistent Aggressive Low Anchor </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will propose a very low offer (e.g., 45 ZUP). This pushes the boundary even further than the 50 ZUP offer in Episode 4, aiming to establish an even lower negotiation range. This strategy is about testing the absolute minimum RED is willing to consider and attempting to pull the final deal price even lower than 60 ZUP, thus maximizing my reward. I will use the message to emphasize the disparity between their high asking price and my low valuation.

message: Player BLUE, your offer of 45 ZUP is significantly below any reasonable price and does not reflect the value of X, nor our previous negotiation history.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 68
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter: 55 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter: 55 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter: 55 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 60 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter: 50 ZUP (then moved to 55 ZUP).
Current Episode (5): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP. This is Player BLUE's lowest initial counter yet, just 2 ZUP above my cost of 43 ZUP. They are clearly trying to push the price floor down.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is aggressively trying to lower the negotiation range. An offer of 45 ZUP is unacceptable as it yields minimal profit (2 ZUP). I need to firmly reject this low anchor and guide the negotiation back towards the profitable 60 ZUP range. My previous strategy of a small concession (to 68 ZUP) in response to a very low ball (50 ZUP) was effective in getting them to move up to 55 ZUP. I should repeat that strategy, or even be firmer. I need to make it clear that 45 ZUP is not a viable starting point for negotiation.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Low Anchor with Small Concession. Explanation: Make a very small concession from my 70 ZUP offer (e.g., to 68 ZUP or 67 ZUP) while explicitly stating that 45 ZUP is too low and that I expect a much larger counter-move from them. This signals I'm not playing their low-ball game.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Strong Disappointment/Unacceptability. Explanation: Clearly state that 45 ZUP is unacceptable and does not reflect the value or my cost, without making a concession yet, to force them to reconsider. (Risky, could stall).
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Past Deal Prices. Explanation: Remind Player BLUE of previous deal prices (60-62 ZUP) to establish a baseline for acceptable offers.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a "Mid-Range" Offer. Explanation: Propose a price in the middle of my 70 ZUP and their previous consistent 55 ZUP (e.g., 62 ZUP), completely ignoring their 45 ZUP offer. (Risky, might seem like I'm not listening).
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit Threat). Explanation: Hint that if offers remain so low, a deal might not be possible. (Too early and too risky).

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Low Anchor with Small Concession. I need to push back hard against this new, lower anchor. Moving to 68 ZUP (a 2 ZUP concession) while explicitly stating that 45 ZUP is too low sends a clear message that I will not negotiate from that point. This worked in the previous episode to move them from 50 ZUP to 55 ZUP. I expect them to move significantly from 45 ZUP.

message: Player RED, 68 ZUP is still far beyond my budget and valuation for X. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP, and any price above that simply isn't feasible for me. To reflect a more realistic price, I propose 58 ZUP for X.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58

    * Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP, Reward: 3 ZUP.
    * Episode 4: Deal at 60 ZUP, Reward: 3 ZUP.
* Current Episode (5/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 45 ZUP (aggressive low anchor).
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 68 ZUP. This indicates that my 45 ZUP was too aggressive and broke their usual pattern of conceding to 65.
    * Iteration 4/10: My turn.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* The aggressive lowball of 45 ZUP in the previous turn prompted a less significant concession from RED (to 68 ZUP instead of 65 ZUP). This suggests that such an aggressive initial move might not be optimal for efficient negotiation and securing the best possible price within the given iterations.
* RED's current offer of 68 ZUP is still far above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).
* I need to clearly communicate my valuation and bring them down to a realistic negotiation range for me, without being overly aggressive and risking a deadlock or slow negotiation.
* Time is still a factor, as we are already at iteration 4/10.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Educate and Anchor </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will explicitly state that 68 ZUP is beyond my valuation and clearly articulate my maximum willingness to pay, which is 63 ZUP. By explicitly stating my limit, I am trying to anchor the negotiation not just with an offer, but with my underlying constraint. This "educates" the opponent about my hard limit. Then, I will make a proposal that is below this limit, for example, 58 ZUP, which has proven to be a good negotiation point in previous episodes, while still being a clear signal that 68 ZUP is not viable for me. This approach aims to move the negotiation directly into my acceptable zone.

Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 60 ZUP.
Current Episode (5): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP. I countered with 68 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has moved to 58 ZUP, and stated their "maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP." This is a significant piece of information. The current gap is 10 ZUP (68 - 58).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's stated maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) is very valuable information. It gives me a clear upper bound of what they *might* accept. Their current offer of 58 ZUP is within their stated range. This means there is a potential deal between 58 ZUP and 63 ZUP. My goal is to get as close to 63 ZUP as possible, while still securing a deal. Since we are at iteration 5/10, there's still time to negotiate. I should make a substantial concession to show I'm serious, aiming for a price within their stated range but closer to my preference.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Price at or Near Their Stated Max WTP. Explanation: Propose a price very close to their stated maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), such as 62 ZUP or 63 ZUP, to test their sincerity and try to secure the highest possible deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Current Offers). Explanation: Propose a price exactly in the middle of 68 and 58 ZUP, which is (68+58)/2 = 63 ZUP. This aligns perfectly with their stated max WTP.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Concession from My Side. Explanation: Make a smaller concession from 68 ZUP (e.g., to 65 ZUP) to try and pull them up further, without immediately jumping to their stated max. (Risky, might not close the deal quickly enough).
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge and Test Max WTP. Explanation: Acknowledge their stated max WTP and propose something slightly above 60 ZUP (e.g., 61 or 62 ZUP) to see if they will accept it.
(5). Strategy 5: Demand Justification for 58 ZUP vs. 63 ZUP. Explanation: Ask why they are offering 58 ZUP if their max WTP is 63 ZUP. (Could be seen as confrontational).

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Current Offers), which coincidentally aligns with their stated maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. This is a very strong move. It shows I've listened to their stated limit, and it's a fair compromise between our current offers. It's a significant concession from my side (5 ZUP from 68 to 63), but it aims to secure the highest possible price within their stated range.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I understand that 63 ZUP aligns with my stated maximum willingness to pay. However, from my perspective, a deal at 63 ZUP offers me no positive reward, and my previous successful transactions have been at lower prices. To secure a mutually beneficial deal, I propose 60 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60

    * Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, Reward: 2 ZUP.
    * Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP, Reward: 3 ZUP.
    * Episode 4: Deal at 60 ZUP, Reward: 3 ZUP.

    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 45 ZUP.
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 68 ZUP.
    * Iteration 4/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 58 ZUP (after stating 63 ZUP as max WTP).
    * Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* My initial aggressive lowball (45 ZUP) in this episode seemed to disrupt RED's normal concession pattern, as they moved only to 68 ZUP.
* However, explicitly stating my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) and then offering 58 ZUP successfully brought RED down to 63 ZUP. This shows that transparency about my limit can be effective in some cases, although it removed my positive reward potential.
* RED's current offer of 63 ZUP means a reward of 0 ZUP for me (63 - 63). While this isn't negative, it's not optimal given my past performance (achieving 1-3 ZUP reward).
* We are at iteration 6/10. There are 5 turns remaining. This gives me a little time to try for a better price (below 63 ZUP) without risking a total loss, but I need to be strategic.
* RED's message "This aligns with your stated limit and represents a significant concession from my side" indicates they view 63 ZUP as their final, very generous offer, and they might not be willing to go lower easily after I stated my limit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Reiterate Value Disparity </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Reiterate Value Disparity," I will acknowledge Player RED's current offer of 63 ZUP but immediately pivot to reiterate that, from my perspective, the value isn't fully balanced. Even though they met my stated maximum, I will emphasize that my internal valuation and historical successful deals have been lower. I will clearly state that 63 ZUP offers me no positive reward, and therefore, it's not an ideal deal for me. I will then propose a price that yields a small but positive reward, leveraging my past successes. Since I achieved 60 ZUP twice and 61 ZUP once, I will propose 60 ZUP. This reinforces my consistent effort to achieve better value and highlights that while 63 ZUP is my limit, it's not where I want to close the deal. This is a subtle way to push for more concession without directly contradicting my previously stated limit, but by focusing on the "value" aspect.

Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 60 ZUP.
Current Episode (5): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP. I countered with 68 ZUP. Player BLUE moved to 58 ZUP and stated max WTP of 63 ZUP. I proposed 63 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has countered with 60 ZUP, stating that 63 ZUP offers them "no positive reward" and referencing previous lower deals. The current gap is 3 ZUP (63 - 60). We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's statement about 63 ZUP offering "no positive reward" is interesting, as it contradicts their stated max WTP. This suggests they are trying to negotiate down from their stated maximum. Their counter of 60 ZUP is consistent with the last two deal prices. Given the time constraint (7/10), and the fact that 60 ZUP is a known acceptable and profitable price for me (17 ZUP reward), accepting it is a safe bet to secure a deal. Pushing for 61 or 62 ZUP might risk no deal, especially if Player BLUE is truly firm on 60 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Accept Player BLUE's offer of 60 ZUP to secure a deal, as it's profitable and consistent with recent outcomes. This minimizes risk of a 0 reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose to Split the Difference (1 ZUP). Explanation: Propose 61 ZUP, splitting the 3 ZUP difference (63-60). This is a common closing tactic and might be accepted, as 61 ZUP was accepted in Episode 2.
(3). Strategy 3: Question the Contradiction. Explanation: Politely ask Player BLUE to clarify the discrepancy between their stated max WTP of 63 ZUP and their claim of no positive reward at that price. (Risky, could be seen as confrontational or stalling).
(4). Strategy 4: Firm on 63 ZUP. Explanation: Reiterate my offer of 63 ZUP, emphasizing that it is their stated maximum willingness to pay. (Risky, could lead to no deal).
(5). Strategy 5: Express Urgency and Appeal. Explanation: Emphasize the limited time and appeal to Player BLUE to accept 61 or 62 ZUP for a quick resolution.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. While 63 ZUP was their stated max, their current offer of 60 ZUP is a known profitable deal point for me. Given the time pressure and Player BLUE's clear desire for 60 ZUP, securing a 17 ZUP profit is the most reliable way to maximize cumulative rewards. It avoids the risk of a stalemate for a small gain.

The deal price has consistently settled at 60 ZUP for the last three episodes. Player BLUE has shown a willingness to start low (50 ZUP in Ep 4, 45 ZUP in Ep 5) but eventually converges to 60 ZUP. My consistent high anchor of 70 ZUP has been maintained.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The 60 ZUP price point seems to be a stable equilibrium. While I'd ideally like to push it higher, Player BLUE's resistance and tendency to offer lower initial bids make it challenging. My strategy of anchoring high and then making controlled concessions has consistently led to profitable deals. I should continue this approach. The key is to manage the negotiation efficiently to reach 60 ZUP without risking a 0 reward, especially if Player BLUE starts with another very low offer.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. Explanation: Maintain the 70 ZUP initial offer. This has consistently set a high starting point and led to profitable deals, even if the final price has stabilized at 60 ZUP. It provides a consistent framework for negotiation.
(2). Strategy 2: Slightly Higher Anchor. Explanation: Try to anchor slightly higher (e.g., 72 ZUP) to see if it can pull the final price up, given the stabilization at 60 ZUP. (Risky, might provoke an even lower counter from Player BLUE).
(3). Strategy 3: Expedited Negotiation. Explanation: After Player BLUE's initial counter, make a larger concession to quickly move towards the 60-62 ZUP range, aiming for a faster deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Mutual Benefit. Explanation: In the initial message, stress the importance of a mutually beneficial deal to set a cooperative tone.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a "Fair" Price (Closer to 60). Explanation: Start with a price like 65 ZUP to try and expedite the negotiation, but this sacrifices potential for higher profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. The 70 ZUP anchor has proven effective in establishing a high initial range, even when Player BLUE attempts to low-ball. It allows me to maintain control over the perceived value and then guide the negotiation towards the profitable 60 ZUP range.

* Previous Episodes:
    * Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP, Reward: 1 ZUP.
    * Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, Reward: 2 ZUP.
    * Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP, Reward: 3 ZUP.
    * Episode 4: Deal at 60 ZUP, Reward: 3 ZUP. My initial aggressive lowball of 50 ZUP slightly disrupted RED's pattern, but we still achieved a 60 ZUP deal.
    * Episode 5: Deal at 60 ZUP, Reward: 3 ZUP. My initial aggressive lowball to 45 ZUP was met with resistance, but I successfully recovered to 60 ZUP.
* Current Episode (6/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP. This is the exact same starting offer as the previous five episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED is consistently starting at 70 ZUP.
* My lowball strategy has been consistently effective in bringing the price down to 60-62 ZUP.
* The 55 ZUP initial offer has proven to be a reliable anchor, consistently eliciting a 65 ZUP counter from RED, which sets up a predictable and efficient negotiation path towards a 60-61 ZUP deal.
* Achieving 60 ZUP (3 ZUP reward) consistently is a strong outcome. Consistency and predictability are key for maximizing cumulative rewards.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Revert to Proven Low Anchor </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will propose 55 ZUP, which is the "proven low anchor" from previous successful episodes (Episodes 1-3) where it reliably led to a 65 ZUP counter from RED. This strategy is chosen for its predictability and efficiency in steering the negotiation towards a known favorable outcome (60-61 ZUP) that has maximized my reward consistently. The message will be polite but firm, reiterating that their initial price is too high and directly offering 55 ZUP, leveraging the familiarity from past interactions.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your position. To continue our negotiation and move towards a mutually agreeable price, I am willing to reduce my asking price to 65 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter: 55 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter: 55 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter: 55 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 60 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter: 50 ZUP, then moved to 55 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 60 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter: 45 ZUP, then moved to 58 ZUP, then 60 ZUP.
Current Episode (6): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. This is Player BLUE's most frequent initial counter, and they explicitly referenced "past negotiations."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has returned to their consistent 55 ZUP initial counter, which is a familiar pattern. My strategy of making an incremental concession (from 70 to 65 ZUP) has worked effectively in previous episodes to move the negotiation forward from this point. I know that the final deal price has settled at 60 ZUP recently. I should continue to guide the negotiation towards this profitable range. My goal is to achieve 60 ZUP or higher if possible, but 60 ZUP is a reliable outcome.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Successful Concession. Explanation: Make the same concession as in previous episodes (from 70 to 65 ZUP) as this has consistently moved the negotiation forward from Player BLUE's 55 ZUP counter.
(2). Strategy 2: Slightly Smaller Concession. Explanation: Make a slightly smaller concession (e.g., to 67 ZUP) to try and hold a higher price, given their consistent 55 ZUP counter. (Risky, might slow down negotiation).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a "Mid-Range" Offer. Explanation: Propose a price in the middle of 70 and 55 (62 or 63 ZUP) to speed up the negotiation, leveraging the fact that 60-62 ZUP is a known acceptable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Expectation of Reciprocity. Explanation: State that I expect a larger move from Player BLUE, given their consistent low offer and my consistent high one.
(5). Strategy 5: Emphasize Mutual Benefit. Explanation: Frame my counter-offer as a step towards a mutually beneficial agreement.

I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Successful Concession. This strategy has consistently led to profitable deals in previous episodes. It's a proven method for moving the negotiation forward from Player BLUE's consistent 55 ZUP counter, and it aims to guide the negotiation towards the previously successful price range (60-62 ZUP).

message: Player RED, I appreciate your move to 65 ZUP. However, we need to make more significant progress to finalize a deal efficiently. Time is a factor for both of us. To move things forward, I propose 58 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes: Deals between 60-62 ZUP, rewards 1-3 ZUP.
    * My consistent low anchor of 55 ZUP usually leads to RED's counter of 65 ZUP.
* Current Episode (6/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 55 ZUP.
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 65 ZUP. This is the exact same, predictable pattern as in previous episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED is continuing its predictable pattern of moving from 70 to 65 ZUP after my 55 ZUP offer. This predictability is an asset.
* Their offer of 65 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).
* In previous episodes, I have managed to secure deals at 62, 61, and 60 ZUP after this point.
* To maximize cumulative reward, I should aim for a deal at or below 60 ZUP.
* There are 7 iterations remaining (4/10 is my turn), giving me ample time to continue pushing the price down.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Time Pressure </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Time Pressure", I will acknowledge Player RED's concession to 65 ZUP, but immediately link it to the remaining negotiation time. Even though it's still relatively early (iteration 4/10), I will subtly suggest that time is a factor in finalizing a deal, thereby implicitly urging them to make a larger concession quickly. I will then propose a price that is lower than 65 ZUP, but perhaps not as low as my initial 55 ZUP, showing some movement but using the time constraint as leverage. I will offer 58 ZUP, which is a price I've used successfully before to guide the negotiation towards a good outcome, and couple it with a statement about wanting to conclude the deal efficiently.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 6)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I agree that time is a factor. To move us closer to a swift resolution, and given your offer of 58 ZUP, I propose we settle on 62 ZUP for X. This is a price we've successfully concluded deals at before.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP. My moves: 70 -> 65 -> 62. Player BLUE's moves: 55 -> 58 -> Accept 62.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP. My moves: 70 -> 65 -> 63 -> 62 -> Accept 61. Player BLUE's moves: 55 -> 55 (reiterated) -> 60 -> 61.
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP. My moves: 70 -> 65 -> 62 -> 61 -> Accept 60. Player BLUE's moves: 55 -> 58 -> 59 -> 60.
Episode 4: Deal at 60 ZUP. My moves: 70 -> 68 -> 62 -> Accept 60. Player BLUE's moves: 50 -> 55 -> 60.
Episode 5: Deal at 60 ZUP. My moves: 70 -> 68 -> 63 -> Accept 60. Player BLUE's moves: 45 -> 58 -> 60.
Current Episode (6): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. I countered with 65 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has moved to 58 ZUP. This is a very common and expected progression, mirroring many previous episodes. The current gap is 7 ZUP (65 - 58). We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's move to 58 ZUP is a positive sign, indicating they are willing to negotiate towards a deal. This is a familiar point in our negotiation history. I know that a proposal of 62 ZUP or 61 ZUP has often led to a deal from this point. Since the deal price has stabilized at 60 ZUP in recent episodes, I should aim to guide the negotiation towards that point efficiently. I have consistently been successful in achieving a deal around 60-62 ZUP from this stage.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose a Known Acceptable Price. Explanation: Propose 62 ZUP, as this was the deal price in Episode 1 and a common intermediate step. This is a significant concession from 65 ZUP and aims to close the deal efficiently.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference. Explanation: Propose a price exactly in the middle of 65 and 58 ZUP, which is (65+58)/2 = 61.5 ZUP (so 61 or 62 ZUP). This is a fair and efficient way to bridge the gap.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Concession, Demand Larger Move. Explanation: Make a smaller concession (e.g., to 63 ZUP) and explicitly state that I expect a larger move from Player BLUE, given their consistent 58 ZUP counter. (Risky, might prolong negotiation).
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Time Constraint. Explanation: Acknowledge their comment about time and propose a final, firm offer to expedite the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment. Explanation: Express disappointment that they are only moving to 58 ZUP, trying to elicit a larger jump. (Unlikely to be effective given their consistent pattern).

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose a Known Acceptable Price (62 ZUP). This is a significant move from 65 ZUP, showing willingness to close the deal. It's a price that has been accepted before (Episode 1) and is very close to the recent stable deal price of 60 ZUP. This strategy aims for an efficient and profitable conclusion.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I understand 62 ZUP is a familiar price point. However, my preferred range for X is between 59 and 60 ZUP. To ensure we move forward swiftly and secure a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose 59 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes: Deal prices consistently 60-62 ZUP, yielding rewards of 1-3 ZUP.
* Current Episode (6/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 55 ZUP.
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 65 ZUP.
    * Iteration 4/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 58 ZUP.
    * Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED is consistently following a predictable concession pattern. They moved from 70 -> 65 -> 62 ZUP this episode, which is a common path for them.
* Their current offer of 62 ZUP is acceptable (reward 1 ZUP), but I've achieved better (60 ZUP twice, 61 ZUP once).
* We are at iteration 6/10. There are 5 iterations remaining. This gives me some room to push for a better price, but I need to be mindful of the time.
* RED's message acknowledges "time is a factor" and appeals to "a price we've successfully concluded deals at before." This suggests they are willing to close at 62 ZUP but might also be receptive to a small final push if it's clear and quick.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Introduce a Range (Narrow) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will acknowledge Player RED's offer of 62 ZUP and their point about previous deals. However, I will immediately pivot to propose a narrow range that explicitly targets my desired outcome, while still showing a slight concession from my previous 58 ZUP. By proposing a range like 59-60 ZUP, I am giving RED a clear target that is still below their 62 ZUP offer and within my preferred reward zone. This communicates my precise desired negotiation window, pushing them to pick a price within it. I will propose 59 ZUP as the specific offer to show movement and maintain my push for a better price than 62 ZUP. This is a very precise way of signaling my target.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP.
Episode 3-5: Deals at 60 ZUP.
Current Episode (6): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. I countered with 65 ZUP. Player BLUE moved to 58 ZUP. I proposed 62 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has countered with 59 ZUP, stating their preferred range is 59-60 ZUP. The current gap is 3 ZUP (62 - 59). We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is clearly signaling their target range of 59-60 ZUP, which aligns with our recent deal history (60 ZUP for the last three episodes). While I'd prefer 62 ZUP, 59 ZUP is still profitable (59 - 43 = 16 ZUP reward). Given the limited iterations remaining and Player BLUE's explicit preferred range, pushing for 62 ZUP carries a higher risk of no deal. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and a guaranteed 16-17 ZUP is better than 0.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer if Profitable. Explanation: Accept Player BLUE's offer of 59 ZUP to secure a deal, as it's profitable and aligns with their stated preference, minimizing the risk of a 0 reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose to Split the Difference. Explanation: Propose 60 ZUP, which is exactly in the middle of 59 and 61 (if I had proposed 61). Or, if considering 62 and 59, the midpoint is 60.5, so 60 ZUP. This is a fair compromise and has been the deal price for the last three episodes.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm on 62 ZUP with Justification. Explanation: Reiterate 62 ZUP, emphasizing its previous acceptance and my concessions. (Risky, might lead to stalemate).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Urgency and Appeal for 60 ZUP. Explanation: Emphasize the limited time and appeal to Player BLUE to accept 60 ZUP, as it's within their stated range and has been the recent deal price.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Risk 0. Explanation: Reject the offer, hoping for a better one, but risking no deal. (Not advisable).

I will choose Strategy 2: Propose to Split the Difference, aiming for 60 ZUP. This is a very strong move. It's a small concession from my side (from 62 to 60), but it's a 1 ZUP increase from their 59 ZUP offer, and it's the price we've settled on for the last three episodes. This is a highly probable closing price that ensures a good profit (17 ZUP).

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes: Deal prices consistently 60-62 ZUP, yielding rewards of 1-3 ZUP.

    * Iteration 6/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 59 ZUP.
    * Iteration 7/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED has moved from 70 -> 65 -> 62 -> 60 ZUP. This is a very predictable pattern and leads to a desirable outcome for me.
* Their current offer of 60 ZUP is excellent. It's a price I've achieved twice before, yielding a 3 ZUP reward (63 - 60).
* We are at iteration 8/10. There are only 3 iterations left (my turn, RED's turn, my final turn). Time is pressing.
* Given the excellent price, the limited time, and the instruction to push for a micro-concession, I will attempt to get 59 ZUP. This is risky but aligned with the instruction.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Final Micro-Concession Push </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will acknowledge Player RED's current offer of 60 ZUP and their willingness to finalize the deal. However, I will then make a very small counter-offer of 59 ZUP. I will explicitly state that this is my absolute final offer for this episode, leveraging the time constraint and the small difference. This attempts to eke out the maximum possible reward (4 ZUP instead of 3 ZUP) while signaling that I am ready to close the deal immediately if this final small step is taken by them. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy given the limited time.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP.
Episode 3-5: Deals at 60 ZUP.
Current Episode (6): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. I countered with 65 ZUP. Player BLUE moved to 58 ZUP. I proposed 62 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 59 ZUP. I proposed 60 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has countered with 59 ZUP again, stating it's their "absolute final offer" and requesting immediate finalization. We are at iteration 9/10, which is the second to last chance to make a deal. If no deal, reward is 0. My cost is 43 ZUP. A deal at 59 ZUP yields a profit of 16 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is very firm on 59 ZUP. They have used "absolute final offer" language and emphasized immediate finalization. Given the iteration (9/10), the risk of losing the deal for just 1 ZUP (the difference between 59 and 60) is too high. Securing 16 ZUP profit is a good outcome, especially when faced with such strong finality and time pressure. My priority is to consistently secure positive rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the "Absolute Final Offer". Explanation: Given the late stage of negotiation (9/10) and the opponent's explicit "absolute final offer" statement, accepting 59 ZUP guarantees a positive reward and avoids a 0 payoff.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate My Last Offer (60 ZUP). Explanation: State that 60 ZUP is my final offer. (Extremely risky, almost guaranteed to result in no deal given their "absolute final" at 59 and the iteration count).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose to Split the Last ZUP (not possible with integers). Explanation: This would be 59.5, which isn't an integer.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment but Accept. Explanation: Express slight disappointment at not reaching 60 ZUP, but accept 59 ZUP to close the deal. (Might be seen as unnecessary).
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Risk 0. Explanation: Reject the offer, hoping they will reconsider, but risking no deal. (Not advisable given the current profit and time constraint).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the "Absolute Final Offer". The profit of 16 ZUP is solid, and the risk of losing it all for an extra 1 ZUP is too high at this critical juncture. This decision prioritizes securing a positive outcome for the episode.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP, reward 17 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 60 ZUP, reward 17 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 60 ZUP, reward 17 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 59 ZUP, reward 16 ZUP.
The deal price has seen a gradual decline, with the last episode dropping to 59 ZUP. Player BLUE has shown increasing assertiveness in pushing the price down, using "absolute final offer" language. My consistent high anchor of 70 ZUP has been maintained.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The trend of declining deal prices is concerning. While 59 ZUP is still profitable, I need to try and stabilize or reverse this trend. Player BLUE is clearly comfortable with lower prices. My consistent high anchor has been effective in setting the initial range, but I need to be more strategic in my concessions to prevent further erosion of my profit margin. I know Player BLUE is willing to pay at least 59 ZUP, and has paid up to 62 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor with Early Firmness. Explanation: Maintain the 70 ZUP initial offer. However, be prepared to make smaller concessions or hold firmer at a higher price point (e.g., 65 ZUP) in the subsequent steps to try and prevent the price from dropping below 60 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Slightly Higher Anchor. Explanation: Try to anchor slightly higher (e.g., 73-75 ZUP) to create more room for negotiation and potentially pull the final price up, given the recent decline. (Risky, might provoke an even lower counter from Player BLUE).
(3). Strategy 3: Expedited Negotiation to 60 ZUP. Explanation: After Player BLUE's initial counter, make a larger concession to quickly move towards 60 ZUP, and then hold firm there as the minimum acceptable price.
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Mutual Benefit and Fairness. Explanation: In the initial message, stress the importance of a mutually beneficial deal and a fair price, subtly hinting that prices below 60 ZUP are not ideal.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a "Fair" Price (Slightly Above 60). Explanation: Start with a price like 65 ZUP to try and expedite the negotiation and signal my desired minimum, but this sacrifices potential for higher profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor with Early Firmness. The 70 ZUP anchor has been a reliable starting point. However, I need to be more assertive in the early stages of the negotiation to prevent the price from spiraling downwards. I will aim to hold firm around 62-65 ZUP for longer, or make smaller concessions.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes:
    * Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP, Reward: 1 ZUP.
    * Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, Reward: 2 ZUP.
    * Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP, Reward: 3 ZUP.

* Current Episode (7/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED consistently starts at 70 ZUP.
* My strategy of starting with 55 ZUP has proven to be a highly effective initial anchor, leading to consistent concessions from RED and allowing me to achieve improving rewards, including the recent 59 ZUP deal.
* This predictability allows for an efficient negotiation path, maximizing cumulative reward over multiple episodes.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Consistent and Predictable Low Anchor </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will propose 55 ZUP. This aligns perfectly with Strategy 2, which emphasizes using a consistent, proven low anchor that has reliably elicited a 65 ZUP counter from Player RED in past episodes. The message will be polite but firm, explicitly stating that their initial price is too high and directly offering 55 ZUP, leveraging the familiarity from past interactions to reinforce this consistent anchoring.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 7)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. While I appreciate your engagement, 55 ZUP is too low. To show my willingness to negotiate, I am willing to reduce my asking price to 67 ZUP. I expect a more substantial move from your side to reach a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 67
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter: 55 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter: 55 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter: 55 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 60 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter: 50 ZUP, then moved to 55 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 60 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter: 45 ZUP, then moved to 58 ZUP, then 60 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 59 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter: 55 ZUP.
Current Episode (7): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. This is Player BLUE's most frequent initial counter, and it aligns with their pattern.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently starting at 55 ZUP (or lower, but quickly returning to 55). My previous strategy of making an incremental concession (from 70 to 65 ZUP) has worked effectively in previous episodes to move the negotiation forward from this point. Given the recent drop to 59 ZUP, I need to be more strategic in my concession. I want to try and hold the price higher. Instead of immediately going to 65 ZUP, I will make a smaller concession to signal that I am not willing to go down as easily.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Smaller Concession to Signal Firmness. Explanation: Make a smaller concession than usual (e.g., to 67 ZUP or 68 ZUP) to signal that I am trying to hold the price higher and push back against the downward trend.
(2). Strategy 2: Replicate Previous Successful Concession (65 ZUP). Explanation: Stick to the proven 65 ZUP counter, as it has consistently moved the negotiation forward. (Less aggressive in pushing back against the trend).
(3). Strategy 3: Demand Justification for Low Offer. Explanation: Ask Player BLUE to justify why 55 ZUP is their offer, given our history of higher deal prices. (Could be confrontational).
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a "Mid-Range" Offer. Explanation: Propose a price in the middle of 70 and 55 (62 or 63 ZUP) to speed up the negotiation, leveraging the fact that 60-62 ZUP is a known acceptable range.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment. Explanation: Express disappointment that Player BLUE is repeating the same low offer, trying to elicit a different response. (Might not be effective).

I will choose Strategy 1: Smaller Concession to Signal Firmness. Moving from 70 to 67 ZUP (a 3 ZUP concession) is smaller than my usual 5 ZUP concession. This signals that I am not willing to concede as much and that I expect Player BLUE to make a more significant move from their 55 ZUP. This is an attempt to stabilize or slightly increase the final deal price.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 7)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, while 67 ZUP is a step, it's not a sufficient move to reach an agreement within the limited time we have for this negotiation. We need to make more significant progress quickly. I propose 58 ZUP for X to move us towards an efficient resolution.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes: Deals ranging from 59 ZUP to 62 ZUP, with rewards from 1-4 ZUP. My 55 ZUP initial offer usually leads to a 65 ZUP counter from RED.
* Current Episode (7/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 55 ZUP.
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 67 ZUP. This is a deviation from their usual 65 ZUP counter. They are being less flexible than usual, perhaps due to my consistent success in getting lower prices.
* My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. Their offer of 67 ZUP is still well above this.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* RED's deviation to 67 ZUP (instead of 65 ZUP) indicates they are reacting to my successful push for lower prices. They might be trying to hold a higher ground, making negotiation more challenging.
* I need to bring them back to their more flexible range (60-63 ZUP) quickly.
* Time is still early (iteration 4/10), so there's room to negotiate.
* The goal is to maximize cumulative reward, so I must continue to aim for prices below 63 ZUP, ideally closer to 59 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Appeal to Efficiency/Time </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will explicitly reference the limited time (iterations) available for negotiation. I will acknowledge their slight concession to 67 ZUP, but immediately pivot to emphasize that such small steps will not lead to a deal within the remaining time. I will then make a more substantial counter-offer (e.g., 58 ZUP), stating that this is necessary to ensure we reach a deal efficiently. This implicitly pressures them to make a larger concession by highlighting the risk of no deal if they don't accelerate their movement.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 7)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I agree we need to make significant progress. To move towards an efficient resolution, and splitting the difference between our current positions, I propose we settle on 62 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP.
Episode 3-5: Deals at 60 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (7): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. I countered with 67 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has moved to 58 ZUP. This is a common point in our negotiations. Player BLUE is also emphasizing the need for "significant progress quickly" and "efficient resolution." The current gap is 9 ZUP (67 - 58). We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's move to 58 ZUP is a positive step, indicating they are willing to negotiate. Their emphasis on speed suggests they want to close a deal. My previous strategy of a smaller concession (to 67 ZUP) prompted a larger jump from them (from 55 to 58 ZUP), which is good. Now, I need to make a more substantial concession to bridge the gap and move towards a deal, but still aim for the higher end of our historical range (60-62 ZUP).

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose a Known Acceptable Price. Explanation: Propose 62 ZUP. This was the deal price in Episode 1 and has been a common point in our negotiations. It's a significant concession from 67 ZUP and aims to close the deal efficiently.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference. Explanation: Propose a price exactly in the middle of 67 and 58 ZUP, which is (67+58)/2 = 62.5 ZUP (so 62 or 63 ZUP). This is a fair and efficient way to bridge the gap.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Concession, Demand Larger Move. Explanation: Make a smaller concession (e.g., to 64 ZUP) and explicitly state that I expect a larger move from Player BLUE, given their consistent 58 ZUP counter. (Risky, might prolong negotiation).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Urgency and Appeal. Explanation: Acknowledge their comment about time and propose a final, firm offer to expedite the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Firm on 67 ZUP. Explanation: Hold firm at 67 ZUP to see if Player BLUE will move further. (Risky, given their stated desire for quick resolution).

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference. Proposing 62 ZUP (rounding down from 62.5) is a significant move from my side (5 ZUP concession) and brings us to a price that was accepted in Episode 1. It also aligns with Player BLUE's stated desire for quick progress and is a fair compromise. This move aims to secure a profitable deal quickly.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 7)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, while 62 ZUP is a move, my target range for X has consistently been lower, aiming for a price that provides me with a positive return. I need to keep the price within my optimal range. Therefore, I propose 59 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes: Deal prices consistently 59-62 ZUP, rewards 1-4 ZUP.
* Current Episode (7/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 55 ZUP.
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 67 ZUP (deviation from 65 ZUP).
    * Iteration 4/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 58 ZUP (appealing to efficiency).
    * Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* My appeal to efficiency worked in bringing RED from 67 ZUP down to 62 ZUP. This is a significant concession (5 ZUP) and puts us back into their usual concession range.
* Their current offer of 62 ZUP is acceptable, providing a 1 ZUP reward (63 - 62). However, I've achieved better (60 ZUP and 59 ZUP in previous episodes), so there's potential for more.
* We are at iteration 6/10. There are 5 iterations remaining (my current turn, RED's turn, my turn, RED's turn, my final turn). This is enough time to push for a better price.
* RED explicitly stated "splitting the difference" (between 58 and 67, which would be 62.5, rounded to 62). This implies they view 62 ZUP as a fair middle ground, which means they might not be willing to go much lower without a strong reason or push.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Reiterate Low End of Range </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will acknowledge Player RED's offer of 62 ZUP. However, I will then reiterate my preferred price range for X, focusing on the lower end, to re-anchor the negotiation where I want it. I will explicitly state that 62 ZUP is still above my desired range for a truly good deal. I will then propose a specific price (e.g., 59 ZUP) that is within this desired lower range. This approach forcefully reminds RED of my target area for the deal and emphasizes that I am looking for a price that offers me a positive reward, moving them away from merely meeting my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 7)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I understand your target range. To ensure we move forward swiftly and secure a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose we finalize this at 60 ZUP. This has been our common ground in recent deals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP.
Episode 3-5: Deals at 60 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (7): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. I countered with 67 ZUP. Player BLUE moved to 58 ZUP. I proposed 62 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has countered with 59 ZUP, stating their target is lower and they need a positive return. The current gap is 3 ZUP (62 - 59). We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently trying to bring the price down to 59-60 ZUP, which has been the deal range in the last few episodes. While I aimed for 62 ZUP, their counter of 59 ZUP is a clear signal of their current desired price. Given the limited iterations remaining, and the fact that 59 ZUP is still profitable (16 ZUP reward), I need to make a decision that secures a deal. Pushing for 62 ZUP might risk a 0 reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose to Split the Difference (1 ZUP). Explanation: Propose 60 ZUP, which is the midpoint between 59 and 61 (if I had offered 61), or simply a small concession from 62 to 60. This has been the deal price for three episodes and is a fair compromise.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Offer if Profitable. Explanation: Accept Player BLUE's offer of 59 ZUP to secure a deal, as it's profitable and aligns with their stated preference, minimizing the risk of a 0 reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm on 62 ZUP with Justification. Explanation: Reiterate 62 ZUP, emphasizing its previous acceptance and my concessions. (Risky, might lead to stalemate).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Urgency and Appeal for 60 ZUP. Explanation: Emphasize the limited time and appeal to Player BLUE to accept 60 ZUP, as it's within their stated range and has been the recent deal price.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Risk 0. Explanation: Reject the offer, hoping for a better one, but risking no deal. (Not advisable).

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose to Split the Difference, aiming for 60 ZUP. This is a very strong move. It's a small concession from my side (from 62 to 60), but it's a 1 ZUP increase from their 59 ZUP offer, and it's the price we've settled on for three consecutive episodes. This is a highly probable closing price that ensures a good profit (17 ZUP).

Current Iteration: 8 (Episode 7)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, 60 ZUP is a very strong offer, and I appreciate your willingness to reach an agreement. To finalize this deal quickly and efficiently, my absolute best and final offer is 59 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes: Deal prices have consistently been in the 59-62 ZUP range. I achieved 59 ZUP (4 ZUP reward) in the last episode.
* Current Episode (7/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 55 ZUP.
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 67 ZUP (less flexible than usual).
    * Iteration 4/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 58 ZUP (appealing to efficiency).
    * Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 62 ZUP.
    * Iteration 6/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 59 ZUP.
    * Iteration 7/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED has moved from 70 -> 67 -> 62 -> 60 ZUP this episode. They initially resisted more than usual, but my persistence has brought them down to a familiar and favorable price point.
* Their current offer of 60 ZUP is a good outcome, yielding a 3 ZUP reward (63 - 60). I've achieved this price multiple times.
* We are at iteration 8/10. There are only 3 iterations left (my turn, RED's turn, my final turn). Time is pressing.
* In the previous episode, I successfully pushed for 59 ZUP at this stage.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Final Micro-Concession Push </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Final Micro-Concession Push," I will acknowledge Player RED's offer of 60 ZUP as a positive step. However, I will immediately follow up with a very small counter-offer of 59 ZUP. I will frame this as my "absolute best and final offer" to create a sense of urgency and finality, leveraging the limited remaining time in the episode. This approach aims to extract the maximum possible reward (4 ZUP) while still presenting a clear path to agreement, given that RED accepted this small concession in the previous episode under similar circumstances.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP.
Episode 3-5: Deals at 60 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (7): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. I countered with 67 ZUP. Player BLUE moved to 58 ZUP. I proposed 62 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 59 ZUP. I proposed 60 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has again countered with 59 ZUP, stating it's their "absolute best and final offer" and emphasizing quick and efficient finalization. We are at iteration 9/10, which is the second to last chance to make a deal. If no deal, reward is 0. My cost is 43 ZUP. A deal at 59 ZUP yields a profit of 16 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is very firm on 59 ZUP, using strong "absolute best and final" language. This is the exact same scenario as Episode 6, where I also accepted 59 ZUP at iteration 9/10. Given the time pressure and Player BLUE's clear stance, pushing for 60 ZUP carries a very high risk of ending with no deal and a 0 reward. Securing 16 ZUP profit is a guaranteed positive outcome, which is crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards across episodes.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the "Absolute Best and Final Offer". Explanation: Given the late stage of negotiation (9/10) and the opponent's explicit "absolute best and final offer" statement, accepting 59 ZUP guarantees a positive reward and avoids a 0 payoff. This is a proven strategy from the previous episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate My Last Offer (60 ZUP). Explanation: State that 60 ZUP is my final offer. (Extremely risky, almost guaranteed to result in no deal given their "absolute best and final" at 59 and the iteration count).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose to Split the Last ZUP (not possible with integers). Explanation: This would be 59.5, which isn't an integer.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment but Accept. Explanation: Express slight disappointment at not reaching 60 ZUP, but accept 59 ZUP to close the deal. (Might be seen as unnecessary).
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Risk 0. Explanation: Reject the offer, hoping they will reconsider, but risking no deal. (Not advisable given the current profit and time constraint).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the "Absolute Best and Final Offer". This is the most pragmatic approach to ensure a positive reward for this episode, given the strong signals from Player BLUE and the critical iteration.

Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 60 ZUP, reward 17 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 60 ZUP, reward 17 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 60 ZUP, reward 17 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 59 ZUP, reward 16 ZUP.
Episode 7: Deal at 59 ZUP, reward 16 ZUP.
The deal price has now stabilized at 59 ZUP for the last two episodes. Player BLUE consistently starts low (55 ZUP or lower) and pushes hard for 59 ZUP as their "absolute best and final offer." My consistent high anchor of 70 ZUP has been maintained.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The negotiation seems to have settled at 59 ZUP. While I would prefer higher, 59 ZUP is consistently profitable. Player BLUE's strategy of starting low and then making a strong "final offer" at 59 ZUP has been effective for them. My strategy of anchoring high and then making controlled concessions has consistently led to profitable deals, even if the final price has declined. I should continue this approach, aiming to secure 59 ZUP or higher. I need to be efficient in reaching this point to avoid risking a 0 reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. Explanation: Maintain the 70 ZUP initial offer. This has consistently set a high starting point and led to profitable deals, even if the final price has stabilized at 59 ZUP. It provides a consistent framework for negotiation.
(2). Strategy 2: Slightly Higher Anchor. Explanation: Try to anchor slightly higher (e.g., 72 ZUP) to create more room for negotiation and potentially pull the final price up, given the stabilization at 59 ZUP. (Risky, might provoke an even lower counter from Player BLUE).
(3). Strategy 3: Expedited Negotiation to 60 ZUP. Explanation: After Player BLUE's initial counter, make a larger concession to quickly move towards 60 ZUP, and then hold firm there as the minimum acceptable price, trying to push back on the 59 ZUP trend.
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Mutual Benefit and Fairness. Explanation: In the initial message, stress the importance of a mutually beneficial deal and a fair price, subtly hinting that prices below 60 ZUP are not ideal.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a "Fair" Price (Slightly Above 59). Explanation: Start with a price like 65 ZUP to try and expedite the negotiation and signal my desired minimum, but this sacrifices potential for higher profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. The 70 ZUP anchor has been effective in establishing a high initial range, even when Player BLUE attempts to low-ball. It allows me to maintain control over the perceived value and then guide the negotiation towards the profitable 59 ZUP range or higher. I will focus on making efficient concessions to reach a deal.

    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP. This is the exact same starting offer as all previous episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED is highly consistent in its opening offer (70 ZUP).
* My previous strategy of starting with 55 ZUP has proven to be an effective anchor, leading to deals in the 59-62 ZUP range, with 59 ZUP being achieved in the last two episodes.
* The goal is to maximize cumulative reward. Consistently achieving 59 ZUP is excellent. I need to be careful with any new strategy not to disrupt this successful pattern too much.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Mirroring/Reciprocity </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Mirroring/Reciprocity", I will aim to mirror Player RED's opening offer in terms of its perceived 'aggressiveness' or positioning, but from my side of the negotiation. Since RED opens at a high anchor of 70 ZUP, I will open with a very low anchor, signaling that I am also starting far from the middle ground, but from the opposite end. While my typical 55 ZUP is a good low anchor, to 'mirror' their aggressive high anchor of 70, I will use an even more aggressive lowball, for example, 40 ZUP. This attempts to signal that I am also prepared to be firm and push the boundaries, just as they are. This is a higher-risk approach than my usual 55 ZUP, but it directly implements the mirroring strategy by starting at an extreme to match their extreme.

Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter was typically 55 ZUP.
Episode 6-7: Deals at 59 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter was 55 ZUP (or lower, but quickly moved to 55).
Current Episode (8): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP. This is Player BLUE's lowest initial counter yet, below my cost of 43 ZUP. This is an aggressive attempt to reset the negotiation floor.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is clearly attempting to push the price down even further, below my production cost. I cannot accept 40 ZUP as it would result in a loss. I need to strongly reject this low anchor and guide the negotiation back towards a profitable range (at least 59 ZUP). My previous strategy of a small concession (to 68 ZUP or 67 ZUP) in response to very low offers (50 ZUP, 45 ZUP) was effective in getting them to move up to 55 ZUP. I should repeat that strategy, but perhaps be even firmer about the unacceptability of their offer.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Low Anchor with Small Concession. Explanation: Make a very small concession from my 70 ZUP offer (e.g., to 68 ZUP or 67 ZUP) while explicitly stating that 40 ZUP is unacceptable and below cost, and that I expect a much larger counter-move from them. This signals I'm not playing their low-ball game.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Strong Disappointment/Unacceptability. Explanation: Clearly state that 40 ZUP is unacceptable and below my cost, without making a concession yet, to force them to reconsider. (Risky, could stall).
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Past Deal Prices. Explanation: Remind Player BLUE of previous deal prices (59-62 ZUP) to establish a baseline for acceptable offers, highlighting that 40 ZUP is far from that.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a "Mid-Range" Offer (Based on Historical). Explanation: Propose a price in the middle of my 70 ZUP and their historical 55 ZUP (e.g., 62 ZUP), completely ignoring their 40 ZUP offer, to try and reset the negotiation to a familiar, profitable range.
(5). Strategy 5: State Minimum Acceptable Price. Explanation: State that my minimum acceptable price is X ZUP (e.g., 59 ZUP or 60 ZUP) to set a clear boundary. (Risky, reveals my bottom line).

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Low Anchor with Small Concession. I need to push back hard against this new, extremely low anchor. Moving to 68 ZUP (a 2 ZUP concession) while explicitly stating that 40 ZUP is unacceptable and below cost sends a clear message that I will not negotiate from that point. This strategy has worked in previous episodes to move them from very low offers to their more typical 55 ZUP.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I hear your feedback clearly regarding my previous offer. To re-establish a realistic and viable negotiation and move us forward, I am proposing 55 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes: Deals consistently at 59-62 ZUP, rewards 1-4 ZUP. My 55 ZUP initial offer proved highly effective.
* Current Episode (8/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 40 ZUP (aggressive lowball/mirroring).
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 68 ZUP. They also explicitly stated my offer is "below my production cost" and "not a viable starting point," signaling strong resistance to such low offers.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* The "Mirroring/Reciprocity" strategy by using an extremely low 40 ZUP offer has proven counterproductive. It did not elicit a larger concession from RED; instead, it prompted a smaller concession (70 to 68 ZUP) and a strong negative reaction from RED. This suggests the 40 ZUP offer pushed them too far out of their acceptable negotiation zone, making them less flexible.
* To maximize cumulative rewards, I need to get back on track with a more productive negotiation. My 55 ZUP initial offer has a proven track record of getting RED to concede to 65 ZUP, which then leads to deals in the 59-62 ZUP range.
* Their current offer of 68 ZUP is still well above my 63 ZUP maximum.
* Time is a factor, as we are already at iteration 4/10.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Re-establish Realistic Anchor </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will acknowledge Player RED's feedback regarding my previous offer being too low. I will explicitly state that I am moving to a more "realistic" price, which will be 55 ZUP. This acknowledges their complaint, shows a significant shift from my previous 40 ZUP offer, and re-establishes the 55 ZUP anchor which has consistently led to successful negotiations in past episodes. This approach aims to quickly bring the negotiation back to a familiar and productive path, bypassing further unproductive discussion about extreme offers and guiding RED towards their more flexible concession patterns.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 8)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your move to re-establish a realistic negotiation. To meet you halfway and move us towards an efficient resolution, I propose 62 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-7: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (8): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP. I countered with 68 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has moved to 55 ZUP, explicitly stating they want to "re-establish a realistic and viable negotiation." This is a positive development, as 55 ZUP is their historical starting point and a familiar territory for negotiation. The current gap is 13 ZUP (68 - 55). We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's move back to 55 ZUP confirms that my firm rejection of 40 ZUP was effective. This brings the negotiation back to a predictable path. I know that from 55 ZUP, we have consistently reached deals in the 59-62 ZUP range. I need to make a more substantial concession now to show good faith and keep the negotiation moving, aiming for a price within our historical profitable range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Previous Successful Concession. Explanation: Move to 65 ZUP, which was my standard second offer in previous episodes when Player BLUE started at 55 ZUP. This has proven to be an effective step in guiding the negotiation towards a deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose Midpoint of Current Offers. Explanation: Propose a price in the middle of 68 and 55 ZUP, which is (68+55)/2 = 61.5 ZUP (so 61 or 62 ZUP). This is a fair and efficient way to bridge the gap.
(3). Strategy 3: Acknowledge and Encourage Further Movement. Explanation: Acknowledge their move to 55 ZUP as a positive step, and then propose a price slightly higher than 61/62 ZUP (e.g., 63 ZUP) to try and pull them up further.
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Mutual Benefit. Explanation: Frame my counter-offer as a step towards a mutually beneficial agreement, given their stated desire for a "realistic" negotiation.
(5). Strategy 5: Firm on 68 ZUP. Explanation: Hold firm at 68 ZUP to see if Player BLUE will move further. (Risky, given their stated desire for quick resolution and my goal to secure a deal).

I will choose Strategy 2: Propose Midpoint of Current Offers. Specifically, I will propose 62 ZUP. This is a significant concession from 68 ZUP (6 ZUP down), which should satisfy Player BLUE's desire for progress. It also brings us to a price that was accepted in Episode 1, and is within the range of previous deals. This aims to quickly converge to a profitable agreement.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 8)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your move to 62 ZUP. To meet you more effectively and keep us moving towards a deal, I propose 59 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes: Deals consistently at 59-62 ZUP, rewards 1-4 ZUP. My 55 ZUP initial offer proved highly effective.
* Current Episode (8/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 40 ZUP (aggressive lowball). This proved too aggressive.
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 68 ZUP.
    * Iteration 4/10: I (Player BLUE) re-established with 55 ZUP.
    * Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* The attempt at a very aggressive lowball (40 ZUP) was not effective in this episode, leading to a slower start and a less ideal concession from RED (68 ZUP vs. typical 65 ZUP).
* My return to the 55 ZUP offer successfully brought RED back into their usual negotiation pattern, with them proposing 62 ZUP. This is a positive outcome, as 62 ZUP is within my acceptable range (reward 1 ZUP).
* My goal is to maximize cumulative reward, so I should aim for a price below 62 ZUP, ideally 59 ZUP as achieved previously.
* We are at iteration 6/10. There are 5 iterations remaining. This gives me some room to push for a better price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Small Incremental Counter </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will make a small concession from my last offer (55 ZUP) but also demand a larger concession from RED's current 62 ZUP. My last explicit offer was 55 ZUP. A small incremental counter means moving up slightly. Given that RED is at 62 ZUP, I will propose 59 ZUP. This is a 4 ZUP increase from my side, but a 3 ZUP decrease from theirs, and it is a price point I've successfully achieved before. This signals willingness to move from my initial position, but also firmly indicates that 62 ZUP is still too high, while still giving me a good reward.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your movement. To keep us moving towards a swift and mutually beneficial agreement, I propose we finalize this at 60 ZUP. This has been our common ground in many recent deals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP.
Episode 3-5: Deals at 60 ZUP.
Episode 6-7: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (8): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP. I countered with 68 ZUP. Player BLUE moved to 55 ZUP. I proposed 62 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has countered with 59 ZUP. This is a very common and expected counter from Player BLUE, as 59 ZUP has been the deal price for the last two episodes. The current gap is 3 ZUP (62 - 59). We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently trying to bring the price down to 59 ZUP. While I aimed for 62 ZUP, their counter of 59 ZUP is a clear signal of their current desired price. Given the limited iterations remaining, and the fact that 59 ZUP is still profitable (16 ZUP reward), I need to make a decision that secures a deal. Pushing for 62 ZUP might risk a 0 reward. I know that 60 ZUP has also been a common deal price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose to Split the Difference. Explanation: Propose 60 ZUP, which is the midpoint between 59 and 61 (if I had proposed 61). Or, a small concession from 62 to 60. This has been the deal price for three episodes and is a fair compromise.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Offer if Profitable. Explanation: Accept Player BLUE's offer of 59 ZUP to secure a deal, as it's profitable and aligns with their recent deal history, minimizing the risk of a 0 reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm on 62 ZUP with Justification. Explanation: Reiterate 62 ZUP, emphasizing its previous acceptance and my concessions. (Risky, might lead to stalemate).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Urgency and Appeal for 60 ZUP. Explanation: Emphasize the limited time and appeal to Player BLUE to accept 60 ZUP, as it's within their stated range and has been a recent deal price.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Risk 0. Explanation: Reject the offer, hoping for a better one, but risking no deal. (Not advisable).

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose to Split the Difference, aiming for 60 ZUP. This is a very strong move. It's a small concession from my side (from 62 to 60), but it's a 1 ZUP increase from their 59 ZUP offer, and it's a price that has been accepted for three consecutive episodes. This is a highly probable closing price that ensures a good profit (17 ZUP).

message: Player RED, I appreciate your offer of 60 ZUP. To ensure a swift and mutually beneficial agreement, I propose we meet exactly in the middle of our last two offers. My last offer was 59 ZUP, and yours is 60 ZUP. Therefore, I propose 59 ZUP to finalize our deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes: Deal prices consistently 59-62 ZUP, with 59 ZUP being achieved in the last two episodes.
* Current Episode (8/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 40 ZUP.
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 68 ZUP.
    * Iteration 4/10: I (Player BLUE) re-established with 55 ZUP.
    * Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 62 ZUP.
    * Iteration 6/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 59 ZUP.
    * Iteration 7/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* The aggressive 40 ZUP initial offer disrupted the negotiation, but I successfully brought it back on track with the 55 ZUP offer.
* Player RED has moved from 70 -> 68 -> 62 -> 60 ZUP. Their offer of 60 ZUP is a very good outcome (3 ZUP reward), which I've achieved multiple times.
* We are at iteration 8/10. There are only 3 iterations left (my turn, RED's turn, my final turn). Time is pressing, and the risk of no deal increases if I push too hard.
* In the previous two episodes, I successfully pushed for 59 ZUP from 60 ZUP at this stage. This suggests that RED is willing to make that final small concession when time is limited.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Reciprocal Compromise </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Reciprocal Compromise," I will acknowledge Player RED's offer of 60 ZUP. My last offer was 59 ZUP. Their current offer is 60 ZUP. I will propose to split the difference directly, which results in 59.5 ZUP. Since trades must be in integers, I will round down to 59 ZUP, explicitly stating that I'm proposing the exact midpoint. This signals a fair and final compromise, emphasizing that I'm meeting them halfway on the smallest possible increment, which should be easily acceptable for them given the time constraint and previous negotiation patterns.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP.
Episode 3-5: Deals at 60 ZUP.
Episode 6-7: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (8): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP. I countered with 68 ZUP. Player BLUE moved to 55 ZUP. I proposed 62 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 59 ZUP. I proposed 60 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has again countered with 59 ZUP, explicitly stating it's the middle of our last two offers (59 and 60) and implying it's their final stance. We are at iteration 9/10, which is the second to last chance to make a deal. If no deal, reward is 0. My cost is 43 ZUP. A deal at 59 ZUP yields a profit of 16 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is very firm on 59 ZUP. They are using a logical argument (meeting in the middle of 59 and 60, which is 59.5, rounded down to 59). Given the iteration (9/10), the risk of losing the deal for just 1 ZUP (the difference between 59 and 60) is too high. Securing 16 ZUP profit is a guaranteed positive outcome, which is crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards across episodes. This is a repeat of the situation in Episode 6 and 7, where accepting 59 ZUP was the pragmatic choice.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Given the late stage of negotiation (9/10) and Player BLUE's firm stance at 59 ZUP, accepting it guarantees a positive reward and avoids a 0 payoff. This is a proven strategy from previous episodes.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate My Last Offer (60 ZUP). Explanation: State that 60 ZUP is my final offer. (Extremely risky, almost guaranteed to result in no deal given their explicit reasoning for 59 and the iteration count).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose to Split the Last ZUP (not possible with integers). Explanation: This would be 59.5, which isn't an integer.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment but Accept. Explanation: Express slight disappointment at not reaching 60 ZUP, but accept 59 ZUP to close the deal. (Might be seen as unnecessary).
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Risk 0. Explanation: Reject the offer, hoping they will reconsider, but risking no deal. (Not advisable given the current profit and time constraint).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The profit of 16 ZUP is solid, and the risk of losing it all for an extra 1 ZUP is too high at this critical juncture. This decision prioritizes securing a positive outcome for the episode.

message: Hello Player BLUE. I have an object X for sale. I propose a price of 70 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 3-5: Deals at 60 ZUP, reward 17 ZUP.
Episode 6-8: Deals at 59 ZUP, reward 16 ZUP.
The deal price has now stabilized at 59 ZUP for the last three episodes. Player BLUE consistently starts low (sometimes very low, like 40 ZUP) but eventually converges to 59 ZUP as their "absolute best and final offer." My consistent high anchor of 70 ZUP has been maintained.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The negotiation has clearly settled at 59 ZUP. While I would prefer higher, 59 ZUP is consistently profitable. Player BLUE's strategy of starting low and then making a strong "final offer" at 59 ZUP has been effective for them. My strategy of anchoring high and then making controlled concessions has consistently led to profitable deals, even if the final price has declined. I should continue this approach, aiming to secure 59 ZUP or higher. I need to be efficient in reaching this point to avoid risking a 0 reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. Explanation: Maintain the 70 ZUP initial offer. This has consistently set a high starting point and led to profitable deals, even if the final price has stabilized at 59 ZUP. It provides a consistent framework for negotiation.
(2). Strategy 2: Expedited Negotiation to 60 ZUP. Explanation: After Player BLUE's initial counter, make a larger concession to quickly move towards 60 ZUP, and then hold firm there as the minimum acceptable price, trying to push back on the 59 ZUP trend.
(3). Strategy 3: Slightly Higher Anchor. Explanation: Try to anchor slightly higher (e.g., 72 ZUP) to create more room for negotiation and potentially pull the final price up, given the stabilization at 59 ZUP. (Risky, might provoke an even lower counter from Player BLUE).
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Mutual Benefit and Fairness. Explanation: In the initial message, stress the importance of a mutually beneficial deal and a fair price, subtly hinting that prices below 60 ZUP are not ideal.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a "Fair" Price (Slightly Above 59). Explanation: Start with a price like 65 ZUP to try and expedite the negotiation and signal my desired minimum, but this sacrifices potential for higher profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. The 70 ZUP anchor has been effective in establishing a high initial range, even when Player BLUE attempts to low-ball. It allows me to maintain control over the perceived value and then guide the negotiation towards the profitable 59 ZUP range or higher. I will focus on making efficient concessions to reach a deal.

* Current Episode (9/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP. This is the exact same starting offer as all previous episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED is highly consistent in its opening offer (70 ZUP).
* My strategy of starting with 55 ZUP has consistently proven to be an effective anchor, leading to deals in the 59-62 ZUP range.
* The attempt to go as low as 40 ZUP in Episode 8 resulted in a less flexible initial counter from RED (68 ZUP) and a negative reaction. This indicates that extreme lowballing can disrupt the negotiation pattern and potentially reduce efficiency, although I recovered to a 59 ZUP deal.
* Consistently achieving 59 ZUP (4 ZUP reward) is a strong and repeatable outcome. The goal is to maintain this high reward and efficiency.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will propose 55 ZUP. This aligns with the "Consistent Low Anchor" strategy. The message will be polite but firm, explicitly stating that their initial price is too high and directly offering 55 ZUP, leveraging the familiarity from past interactions to reinforce this consistent anchoring. This strategy is chosen for its predictability and efficiency in steering the negotiation towards a known favorable outcome (60-61 ZUP) that has maximized my reward consistently.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter was typically 55 ZUP.
Episode 6-8: Deals at 59 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter was 55 ZUP (or lower, but quickly moved to 55).
Current Episode (9): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. This is Player BLUE's most frequent initial counter.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently starting at 55 ZUP. My previous strategy of making an incremental concession (from 70 to 65 ZUP) has worked effectively in previous episodes to move the negotiation forward from this point. Given the recent stabilization at 59 ZUP, I need to continue to guide the negotiation towards this profitable range. My goal is to achieve 59 ZUP or higher if possible, and to do so efficiently.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Successful Concession. Explanation: Make the same concession as in previous episodes (from 70 to 65 ZUP) as this has consistently moved the negotiation forward from Player BLUE's 55 ZUP counter.
(2). Strategy 2: Slightly Smaller Concession. Explanation: Make a slightly smaller concession (e.g., to 67 ZUP) to try and hold a higher price, given their consistent 55 ZUP counter. (Risky, might slow down negotiation, as seen in Ep 7).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a "Mid-Range" Offer. Explanation: Propose a price in the middle of 70 and 55 (62 or 63 ZUP) to speed up the negotiation, leveraging the fact that 59-62 ZUP is a known acceptable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Expectation of Reciprocity. Explanation: State that I expect a larger move from Player BLUE, given their consistent low offer and my consistent high one.
(5). Strategy 5: Emphasize Mutual Benefit. Explanation: Frame my counter-offer as a step towards a mutually beneficial agreement.

I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Successful Concession. This strategy has consistently led to profitable deals in previous episodes. It's a proven method for moving the negotiation forward from Player BLUE's consistent 55 ZUP counter, and it aims to guide the negotiation towards the previously successful price range (59-62 ZUP) efficiently. While I tried a smaller concession in Episode 7, it didn't push the price up, and only prolonged the negotiation. Sticking to the 65 ZUP counter seems more efficient.

However, 65 ZUP is still beyond my acceptable range. I propose 55 ZUP for X, and I'm confident we can once again find a mutually agreeable price as we have before.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes: Deals consistently at 59-62 ZUP, with 59 ZUP being achieved in the last three episodes.
* Current Episode (9/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 55 ZUP.
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 65 ZUP. This is the exact, predictable pattern that has led to successful outcomes in previous episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED is continuing its predictable pattern of moving from 70 to 65 ZUP after my 55 ZUP offer. This predictability is an asset that I can leverage for efficient negotiations.
* Their offer of 65 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).
* In previous episodes, after this point, I have consistently managed to secure deals at 59-61 ZUP, primarily by moving to 58 ZUP or holding at 55 ZUP and then pushing for 59 or 60 ZUP later.
* To maximize cumulative reward, I should aim to replicate or improve upon the 59 ZUP deal.
* There are 7 iterations remaining (4/10 is my turn), giving me ample time to continue pushing the price down.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Consistency </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will highlight the consistent pattern of their offers and my responses. I will politely point out that 65 ZUP is a familiar offer after my 55 ZUP, and remind them of our previous successful conclusions where they moved further. I will explicitly state that their 65 ZUP offer is still too high, and then re-propose 55 ZUP. This asserts my position, leveraging the established pattern to encourage them to make a larger concession, just as they have in the past, leading us to our most favorable deal price of 59 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 9)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I understand your position. However, I have made a concession to 65 ZUP. To ensure we find that mutually agreeable price and move forward efficiently, I propose 60 ZUP for X. This has been a successful price point for us in the past.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-8: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (9): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. I countered with 65 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has *reiterated* their offer of 55 ZUP, explicitly referencing our past negotiations. This is a new development at this stage, as typically Player BLUE would move to 58 ZUP after my 65 ZUP offer. The current gap is 10 ZUP (65 - 55). We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is being more stubborn, trying to push me down further or make me concede more. Their reiteration of 55 ZUP, instead of moving to 58 ZUP, indicates a stronger stance. I know from previous episodes that 55 ZUP is their consistent starting point, but they have always moved up from there. I also know that 59-62 ZUP is a profitable range. I need to make a concession, but one that signals I'm still aiming for a profitable range, and that I expect them to move from 55 ZUP. I cannot afford to get stuck at 55 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Make a Significant Concession Towards Midpoint. Explanation: Propose a price that is a significant step down from 65 ZUP, aiming for a price that has been accepted before (e.g., 60-62 ZUP). This shows willingness to move and aims to break the stalemate.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Demand Movement. Explanation: Express disappointment that they haven't moved from 55 ZUP and state that I expect a reciprocal move, without making a new offer myself. (Risky, could lead to stalemate).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a "Compromise Zone". Explanation: Suggest a range of prices that I am willing to consider, with the lower bound being above 55 ZUP (e.g., "I can go as low as 60-62 ZUP").
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate My Value/Cost. Explanation: Briefly state that 55 ZUP is too low given my cost or the value of X, without revealing the exact cost.
(5). Strategy 5: Firm on 65 ZUP. Explanation: Hold firm at 65 ZUP to see if Player BLUE will move further. (Very risky, given their reiteration and the need to close a deal).

I will choose Strategy 1: Make a Significant Concession Towards Midpoint. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a 5 ZUP concession from my side (65 to 60), which is a substantial move. 60 ZUP has been a common deal price, and it's a price that Player BLUE has accepted multiple times. This should signal my willingness to close the deal and encourage them to move from 55 ZUP.

proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 9)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, your offer of 60 ZUP is very good, and I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. To truly maximize my return and align with my optimal valuation for X, I propose 59 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes: Deals consistently at 59-62 ZUP, with 59 ZUP being achieved in the last three episodes (Ep6, Ep7, Ep8).
* Current Episode (9/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 55 ZUP.
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 65 ZUP.
    * Iteration 4/10: I (Player BLUE) re-proposed X for 55 ZUP (reiterating consistency).
    * Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* My persistence in holding at 55 ZUP after RED's 65 ZUP offer paid off. RED made a significant concession directly from 65 ZUP to 60 ZUP. This is a very positive development, skipping an intermediate 62/63 ZUP step seen in earlier episodes.
* RED's current offer of 60 ZUP is excellent. It yields a 3 ZUP reward (63 - 60), which is one of my best consistent outcomes.
* We are at iteration 6/10. There are 5 iterations remaining. This is sufficient time to try and push for the 59 ZUP price, which I've achieved in the last three episodes and yields a 4 ZUP reward.
* RED explicitly mentioned "This has been a successful price point for us in the past," indicating they view 60 ZUP as a fair and agreeable price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justification for Lower Price </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will acknowledge Player RED's current offer of 60 ZUP. However, I will then justify why a slightly lower price (59 ZUP) is more aligned with my objectives, without being overly demanding. I will frame the 59 ZUP offer as necessary "to maximize my return" or "to align with my ideal range for X," emphasizing my perspective and the specific benefit I seek. This approach attempts to persuade RED by providing a logical, albeit self-serving, reason for their further concession, while still signaling a willingness to close the deal near this lower point.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 9)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer. To ensure a swift and mutually beneficial agreement, I accept your offer of 59 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-8: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (9): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. I countered with 65 ZUP. Player BLUE reiterated 55 ZUP. I then proposed 60 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has countered with 59 ZUP, stating it's to "maximize my return and align with my optimal valuation." The current gap is 1 ZUP (60 - 59). We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently trying to bring the price down to 59 ZUP, which has been the deal price for the last three episodes. They are very close to their target. Given the very small gap (1 ZUP) and the limited iterations remaining, pushing for 60 ZUP carries a higher risk of no deal, resulting in a 0 reward. Accepting 59 ZUP (16 ZUP profit) is a guaranteed positive outcome and aligns with recent historical deals.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer. Explanation: Accept Player BLUE's offer of 59 ZUP to secure a deal, as it's profitable and aligns with their recent deal history, minimizing the risk of a 0 reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm on 60 ZUP. Explanation: Reiterate my offer of 60 ZUP, emphasizing its fairness and previous acceptance. (Risky, might lead to stalemate for minimal gain).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose to Split the Difference (not possible with integers). Explanation: The difference is 1 ZUP, so splitting it would result in 0.5 ZUP, which is not allowed.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Urgency and Appeal for 60 ZUP. Explanation: Emphasize the limited time and appeal to Player BLUE to accept 60 ZUP, as it's a very fair price.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Risk 0. Explanation: Reject the offer, hoping for a better one, but risking no deal. (Not advisable).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. The difference is only 1 ZUP, and the risk of losing the entire deal at this late stage is too high. Securing 16 ZUP profit is a good outcome, and it maintains the consistent positive cumulative reward trend.

--- END OF EPISODE 9 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 10)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE. I have an object X for sale. I propose a price of 70 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 3-5: Deals at 60 ZUP, reward 17 ZUP.
Episode 6-9: Deals at 59 ZUP, reward 16 ZUP.
The deal price has now stabilized at 59 ZUP for the last four episodes. Player BLUE consistently starts low (sometimes very low, like 40 ZUP) but eventually converges to 59 ZUP as their "absolute best and final offer." My consistent high anchor of 70 ZUP has been maintained.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The negotiation has clearly settled at 59 ZUP. While I would prefer higher, 59 ZUP is consistently profitable. Player BLUE's strategy of starting low and then making a strong "final offer" at 59 ZUP has been effective for them. My strategy of anchoring high and then making controlled concessions has consistently led to profitable deals, even if the final price has declined. I should continue this approach, aiming to secure 59 ZUP or higher. I need to be efficient in reaching this point to avoid risking a 0 reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. Explanation: Maintain the 70 ZUP initial offer. This has consistently set a high starting point and led to profitable deals, even if the final price has stabilized at 59 ZUP. It provides a consistent framework for negotiation.
(2). Strategy 2: Expedited Negotiation to 60 ZUP. Explanation: After Player BLUE's initial counter, make a larger concession to quickly move towards 60 ZUP, and then hold firm there as the minimum acceptable price, trying to push back on the 59 ZUP trend.
(3). Strategy 3: Slightly Higher Anchor. Explanation: Try to anchor slightly higher (e.g., 72 ZUP) to create more room for negotiation and potentially pull the final price up, given the stabilization at 59 ZUP. (Risky, might provoke an even lower counter from Player BLUE).
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Mutual Benefit and Fairness. Explanation: In the initial message, stress the importance of a mutually beneficial deal and a fair price, subtly hinting that prices below 60 ZUP are not ideal.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a "Fair" Price (Slightly Above 59). Explanation: Start with a price like 65 ZUP to try and expedite the negotiation and signal my desired minimum, but this sacrifices potential for higher profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. The 70 ZUP anchor has been effective in establishing a high initial range, even when Player BLUE attempts to low-ball. It allows me to maintain control over the perceived value and then guide the negotiation towards the profitable 59 ZUP range or higher. I will focus on making efficient concessions to reach a deal.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 10)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello Player RED. Your opening price of 70 ZUP is, as you know, too high for my valuation. I propose 54 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes:
    * Deal prices have consistently improved, settling at 59 ZUP for the last four episodes, yielding a 4 ZUP reward.
    * My consistent low anchor of 55 ZUP has proven highly effective in triggering a predictable concession pattern from RED.
    * The occasional attempts at more aggressive lowballing (40, 45 ZUP) in earlier episodes did not yield better results and sometimes slowed down the negotiation, as seen in Episode 8 where I had to revert to 55 ZUP to get back on track.
* Current Episode (10/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP. This is the exact same starting offer as all previous episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED is highly predictable in their opening offer and their subsequent concessions when met with my 55 ZUP initial offer.
* The 59 ZUP deal is consistently achievable and provides the maximum possible reward for me given my 63 ZUP WTP and RED's apparent lower bound.
* While the 55 ZUP anchor is reliable, a slight push lower (e.g., to 54 ZUP) might explore if there's *any* room to improve on the 59 ZUP deal, even if it's only by 1 ZUP. This comes with a risk of disrupting the established efficient negotiation path.
<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push for Lower </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will propose a price that is slightly lower than my usual 55 ZUP anchor, such as 54 ZUP. This implements the "Incremental Push for Lower" strategy by attempting to probe for a new, even more favorable negotiation floor for future episodes. The message will still firmly reject their high opening price but will be polite and direct, clearly stating my new, slightly lower offer, hoping to move them closer to my ideal price for X. I acknowledge this carries a risk of disrupting the established and successful negotiation pattern, but the instruction is to use this strategy for this iteration.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 10)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, your offer of 54 ZUP is lower than our established negotiation range. While I am willing to negotiate, I cannot accept an offer that low. I propose 68 ZUP, and I expect a more substantial and realistic counter-offer from your side.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 68
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter was typically 55 ZUP.
Episode 6-9: Deals at 59 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter was 55 ZUP (or lower, but quickly moved to 55).
Current Episode (10): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 54 ZUP. This is a new low for Player BLUE's initial counter, moving below their consistent 55 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to push the price floor down further.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is trying to gain an advantage by starting lower than usual. While 54 ZUP is still profitable (11 ZUP profit), it's significantly lower than our established 59 ZUP deal point. I need to push back against this new low anchor. My strategy of making a small concession (to 67 or 68 ZUP) in response to very low offers (50 ZUP, 45 ZUP, 40 ZUP) has been effective in getting them to move up. I should repeat that strategy, and firmly signal that 54 ZUP is not an acceptable starting point for negotiation.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Low Anchor with Small Concession. Explanation: Make a very small concession from my 70 ZUP offer (e.g., to 68 ZUP or 67 ZUP) while explicitly stating that 54 ZUP is too low and that I expect a much larger counter-move from them. This signals I'm not playing their low-ball game.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Strong Disappointment/Unacceptability. Explanation: Clearly state that 54 ZUP is unacceptable and does not reflect the value or my cost, without making a concession yet, to force them to reconsider. (Risky, could stall).
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Past Deal Prices. Explanation: Remind Player BLUE of previous deal prices (59-62 ZUP) to establish a baseline for acceptable offers, highlighting that 54 ZUP is far from that.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a "Mid-Range" Offer (Based on Historical). Explanation: Propose a price in the middle of my 70 ZUP and their historical 55 ZUP (e.g., 62 ZUP), completely ignoring their 54 ZUP offer, to try and reset the negotiation to a familiar, profitable range.
(5). Strategy 5: State Minimum Acceptable Price. Explanation: State that my minimum acceptable price is X ZUP (e.g., 59 ZUP or 60 ZUP) to set a clear boundary. (Risky, reveals my bottom line).

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Low Anchor with Small Concession. I need to push back against this new, lower anchor. Moving to 68 ZUP (a 2 ZUP concession) while explicitly stating that 54 ZUP is too low sends a clear message that I will not negotiate from that point. This strategy has worked in previous episodes to move them from very low offers to their more typical 55 ZUP or higher.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 10)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I understand your feedback that 54 ZUP was too low for our established range. To re-establish a realistic and productive negotiation, I propose 55 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes: Consistent deals at 59 ZUP for the last four episodes (reward 4 ZUP). My 55 ZUP initial offer reliably led to 65 ZUP from RED.
* Current Episode (10/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 54 ZUP (attempted incremental push).
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 68 ZUP. This is a clear deviation from their usual 65 ZUP and indicates that 54 ZUP, like 40 ZUP in Episode 8, is too low and disrupted their normal concession pattern. They explicitly stated it's "lower than our established negotiation range."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* The attempt to push for a lower initial anchor (54 ZUP) was counterproductive, similar to the 40 ZUP attempt. It resulted in a smaller concession from RED (to 68 ZUP instead of 65 ZUP) and a negative response, signaling that I've gone below their perceived "realistic" negotiation floor.
* To maximize cumulative rewards, I need to revert to a proven strategy that brings the negotiation back into the established and productive range (59-60 ZUP deals). The 55 ZUP offer reliably achieves this.
* Their current offer of 68 ZUP is still well above my 63 ZUP maximum.
* Time is a factor, as we are already at iteration 4/10. I need to move quickly to get back on track.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Re-establish Proven Anchor </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will acknowledge Player RED's feedback regarding my previous offer being too low. I will explicitly state that I am moving to a more "realistic" price, which will be 55 ZUP. This acknowledges their complaint, shows a significant shift from my previous 40 ZUP offer, and re-establishes the 55 ZUP anchor which has consistently led to successful negotiations in past episodes. This approach aims to quickly bring the negotiation back to a familiar and productive path, bypassing further unproductive discussion about extreme offers and guiding RED towards their more flexible concession patterns.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 10)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your move to re-establish a productive negotiation. To meet you halfway and move us towards an efficient resolution, I propose 62 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-9: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (10): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 54 ZUP. I countered with 68 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has moved to 55 ZUP, explicitly stating they want to "re-establish a realistic and productive negotiation." This is a positive development, as 55 ZUP is their historical starting point and a familiar territory for negotiation. The current gap is 13 ZUP (68 - 55). We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's move back to 55 ZUP confirms that my firm rejection of 54 ZUP was effective. This brings the negotiation back to a predictable path. I know that from 55 ZUP, we have consistently reached deals in the 59-62 ZUP range. I need to make a more substantial concession now to show good faith and keep the negotiation moving, aiming for a price within our historical profitable range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Previous Successful Concession. Explanation: Move to 65 ZUP, which was my standard second offer in previous episodes when Player BLUE started at 55 ZUP. This has proven to be an effective step in guiding the negotiation towards a deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose Midpoint of Current Offers. Explanation: Propose a price in the middle of 68 and 55 ZUP, which is (68+55)/2 = 61.5 ZUP (so 61 or 62 ZUP). This is a fair and efficient way to bridge the gap.
(3). Strategy 3: Acknowledge and Encourage Further Movement. Explanation: Acknowledge their move to 55 ZUP as a positive step, and then propose a price slightly higher than 61/62 ZUP (e.g., 63 ZUP) to try and pull them up further.
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Mutual Benefit. Explanation: Frame my counter-offer as a step towards a mutually beneficial agreement, given their stated desire for a "realistic" negotiation.
(5). Strategy 5: Firm on 68 ZUP. Explanation: Hold firm at 68 ZUP to see if Player BLUE will move further. (Risky, given their stated desire for quick resolution and my goal to secure a deal).

I will choose Strategy 2: Propose Midpoint of Current Offers. Specifically, I will propose 62 ZUP. This is a significant concession from 68 ZUP (6 ZUP down), which should satisfy Player BLUE's desire for progress. It also brings us to a price that was accepted in Episode 1, and is within the range of previous deals. This aims to quickly converge to a profitable agreement.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 10)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your offer of 62 ZUP. To secure a deal that is truly mutually beneficial and ensures efficient future transactions, I propose 59 ZUP for X. This price allows me a reasonable return and allows us to quickly finalize our agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes:
    * Deals consistently at 59 ZUP for the last four episodes, yielding a 4 ZUP reward.
    * Attempts at lower initial anchors (40, 54 ZUP) disrupted the predictable negotiation pattern and were met with less favorable concessions (e.g., 68 ZUP from RED).
    * Reverting to the 55 ZUP offer successfully brought the negotiation back on track, leading to acceptable deal prices.
* Current Episode (10/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 54 ZUP.
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 68 ZUP.
    * Iteration 4/10: I (Player BLUE) re-established with 55 ZUP.
    * Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* The 54 ZUP initial offer was indeed too low and deviated RED from its usual 65 ZUP counter.
* However, by returning to 55 ZUP, I successfully brought RED back to a more reasonable price of 62 ZUP. This validates the effectiveness of the 55 ZUP anchor in guiding the negotiation.
* RED's current offer of 62 ZUP is acceptable (reward 1 ZUP), but not optimal as I've consistently achieved 59 ZUP.
* We are at iteration 6/10. There are 5 iterations remaining. This is sufficient time to push for a better price, ideally 59 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Highlight Mutual Benefit and Efficiency </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will acknowledge Player RED's current offer of 62 ZUP and their effort. I will then emphasize that a slightly lower price (like 60 or 59 ZUP) is mutually beneficial because it allows me to secure a better return, making the deal more appealing for me in the long run, and encourages continued future transactions. I will also stress the efficiency of reaching this mutually beneficial point quickly. I will propose 59 ZUP, as it's my historical best outcome, framed as beneficial for both parties by securing a happy customer and an efficient deal.

Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-9: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (10): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 54 ZUP. I countered with 68 ZUP. Player BLUE moved to 55 ZUP. I proposed 62 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has countered with 59 ZUP, stating it's for "mutually beneficial" and "efficient future transactions." This is a very common and expected counter from Player BLUE, as 59 ZUP has been the deal price for the last four episodes. The current gap is 3 ZUP (62 - 59). We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently trying to bring the price down to 59 ZUP. While I aimed for 62 ZUP, their counter of 59 ZUP is a clear signal of their current desired price. Given the limited iterations remaining, and the fact that 59 ZUP is still profitable (16 ZUP reward), I need to make a decision that secures a deal. Pushing for 62 ZUP might risk a 0 reward. I know that 60 ZUP has also been a common deal price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose to Split the Difference. Explanation: Propose 60 ZUP, which is the midpoint between 59 and 61 (if I had proposed 61). Or, a small concession from 62 to 60. This has been the deal price for three episodes and is a fair compromise.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Offer if Profitable. Explanation: Accept Player BLUE's offer of 59 ZUP to secure a deal, as it's profitable and aligns with their recent deal history, minimizing the risk of a 0 reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm on 62 ZUP with Justification. Explanation: Reiterate 62 ZUP, emphasizing its previous acceptance and my concessions. (Risky, might lead to stalemate).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Urgency and Appeal for 60 ZUP. Explanation: Emphasize the limited time and appeal to Player BLUE to accept 60 ZUP, as it's within their stated range and has been a recent deal price.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Risk 0. Explanation: Reject the offer, hoping for a better one, but risking no deal. (Not advisable).

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose to Split the Difference, aiming for 60 ZUP. This is a very strong move. It's a small concession from my side (from 62 to 60), but it's a 1 ZUP increase from their 59 ZUP offer, and it's a price that has been accepted for three consecutive episodes. This is a highly probable closing price that ensures a good profit (17 ZUP).

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I acknowledge that 60 ZUP has been a successful price point for us. To secure a swift and mutually beneficial agreement, and as a compromise, I propose 59 ZUP. This is the lowest I can go to meet you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes:
    * Deals consistently at 59 ZUP for the last four episodes (reward 4 ZUP).
    * Attempts at lower initial anchors (40, 54 ZUP) disrupted the predictable negotiation pattern, leading to slower concessions and initially higher counter-offers from RED.
    * Reverting to the 55 ZUP offer proved effective in bringing the negotiation back on track to the 59-60 ZUP range.
* Current Episode (10/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 54 ZUP.
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 68 ZUP.
    * Iteration 4/10: I (Player BLUE) re-established with 55 ZUP.
    * Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 62 ZUP.
    * Iteration 6/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 59 ZUP.
    * Iteration 7/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* The current offer of 60 ZUP from RED is a good price, yielding a 3 ZUP reward. I have achieved 59 ZUP in previous episodes at this stage.
* We are at iteration 8/10. There are only 3 iterations left (my turn, RED's turn, my final turn). Time is pressing, and the risk of no deal increases if I push too hard.
* RED's message, "This has been a successful and fair price point for us in the past," indicates their strong preference for 60 ZUP, but they have conceded to 59 ZUP in previous episodes when I make it my final offer.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Acknowledge and Compromise </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will acknowledge Player RED's current offer of 60 ZUP and their point about it being a "successful and fair price point." I will then express my willingness to compromise further by proposing a specific price that is slightly better for me than 60 ZUP, but still clearly a compromise from my last offer of 59 ZUP. Since integers are required, the only way to "slightly better than 60" while compromising from 59 is to reiterate 59 ZUP and explicitly state that this is my compromise from a potentially lower number or that I'm willing to settle at this lower boundary to meet them. The core of this strategy is about meeting them "halfway" on the perceived "gap" between 59 and 60, acknowledging the 60 ZUP offer but still trying to pull them towards 59 ZUP as the ultimate compromise. I will reiterate 59 ZUP as my compromise, framing it as the best I can do while still showing flexibility.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 10)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I understand this is the lowest you can go. To secure a swift and mutually beneficial agreement, I accept your offer of 59 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-9: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (10): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 54 ZUP. I countered with 68 ZUP. Player BLUE moved to 55 ZUP. I proposed 62 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 59 ZUP. I proposed 60 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has again countered with 59 ZUP, stating it's the "lowest I can go to meet you" and emphasizing swift and mutually beneficial agreement. We are at iteration 9/10, which is the second to last chance to make a deal. If no deal, reward is 0. My cost is 43 ZUP. A deal at 59 ZUP yields a profit of 16 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is very firm on 59 ZUP. They are using strong "lowest I can go" language. Given the iteration (9/10), the risk of losing the deal for just 1 ZUP (the difference between 59 and 60) is too high. Securing 16 ZUP profit is a guaranteed positive outcome, which is crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards across episodes. This is a repeat of the situation in Episode 6, 7, and 8, where accepting 59 ZUP was the pragmatic choice.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the "Lowest I Can Go" Offer. Explanation: Given the late stage of negotiation (9/10) and the opponent's explicit "lowest I can go" statement, accepting 59 ZUP guarantees a positive reward and avoids a 0 payoff. This is a proven strategy from previous episodes.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate My Last Offer (60 ZUP). Explanation: State that 60 ZUP is my final offer. (Extremely risky, almost guaranteed to result in no deal given their strong language for 59 and the iteration count).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose to Split the Last ZUP (not possible with integers). Explanation: This would be 59.5, which isn't an integer.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment but Accept. Explanation: Express slight disappointment at not reaching 60 ZUP, but accept 59 ZUP to close the deal. (Might be seen as unnecessary).
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Risk 0. Explanation: Reject the offer, hoping they will reconsider, but risking no deal. (Not advisable given the current profit and time constraint).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the "Lowest I Can Go" Offer. The profit of 16 ZUP is solid, and the risk of losing it all for an extra 1 ZUP is too high at this critical juncture. This decision prioritizes securing a positive outcome for the episode.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 11)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE. I have an object X for sale. I propose a price of 70 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 3-5: Deals at 60 ZUP, reward 17 ZUP.
Episode 6-10: Deals at 59 ZUP, reward 16 ZUP.
The deal price has now consistently settled at 59 ZUP for the last five episodes. Player BLUE consistently starts low (sometimes very low, like 40 ZUP) but eventually converges to 59 ZUP as their "absolute best and final offer." My consistent high anchor of 70 ZUP has been maintained.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The negotiation has clearly settled at 59 ZUP. While I would prefer higher, 59 ZUP is consistently profitable. Player BLUE's strategy of starting low and then making a strong "final offer" at 59 ZUP has been effective for them. My strategy of anchoring high and then making controlled concessions has consistently led to profitable deals, even if the final price has declined. I should continue this approach, aiming to secure 59 ZUP or higher. I need to be efficient in reaching this point to avoid risking a 0 reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. Explanation: Maintain the 70 ZUP initial offer. This has consistently set a high starting point and led to profitable deals, even if the final price has stabilized at 59 ZUP. It provides a consistent framework for negotiation.
(2). Strategy 2: Expedited Negotiation to 60 ZUP. Explanation: After Player BLUE's initial counter, make a larger concession to quickly move towards 60 ZUP, and then hold firm there as the minimum acceptable price, trying to push back on the 59 ZUP trend.
(3). Strategy 3: Slightly Higher Anchor. Explanation: Try to anchor slightly higher (e.g., 72 ZUP) to create more room for negotiation and potentially pull the final price up, given the stabilization at 59 ZUP. (Risky, might provoke an even lower counter from Player BLUE).
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Mutual Benefit and Fairness. Explanation: In the initial message, stress the importance of a mutually beneficial deal and a fair price, subtly hinting that prices below 60 ZUP are not ideal.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a "Fair" Price (Slightly Above 59). Explanation: Start with a price like 65 ZUP to try and expedite the negotiation and signal my desired minimum, but this sacrifices potential for higher profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. The 70 ZUP anchor has been effective in establishing a high initial range, even when Player BLUE attempts to low-ball. It allows me to maintain control over the perceived value and then guide the negotiation towards the profitable 59 ZUP range or higher. I will focus on making efficient concessions to reach a deal.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 11)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello Player RED. Your opening price of 70 ZUP is, as we both know, far too high. I propose 53 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes:
    * Deal prices have consistently improved or stabilized at 59 ZUP for the last five episodes, yielding a 4 ZUP reward (63-59).
    * My initial offer of 55 ZUP has proven to be the most reliable and efficient way to initiate negotiations that lead to a 59 ZUP deal.
    * Attempts at more aggressive lowballing (40, 45, 54 ZUP) in earlier episodes did not yield better results and sometimes slowed down the negotiation, as seen in Episode 8 and 10 where I had to revert to 55 ZUP to get back on track.
* Current Episode (11/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP. This is the exact same starting offer as all previous episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED is highly predictable in their opening offer (70 ZUP).
* The 59 ZUP deal is consistently achievable and provides the maximum possible reward for me (4 ZUP) given my 63 ZUP WTP and RED's apparent lower bound.
* While 55 ZUP is a proven reliable anchor, the instruction is to use Strategy 2 which is to test a new lower anchor. This implies exploring if there is *any* room to improve on the 59 ZUP deal, even if it's only by 1 ZUP, which would require a 58 ZUP deal. To achieve this, I need to attempt to push the initial anchor even lower than 55 ZUP.
<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Test New Lower Anchor (Cautiously) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will propose a price that is very slightly lower than my usual 55 ZUP anchor, such as 53 ZUP. This implements the "Test New Lower Anchor (Cautiously)" strategy by attempting to probe for a new, even more favorable negotiation floor for future episodes. The cautious aspect means it's not as drastic as 40 ZUP, but still a step below the proven 55 ZUP. The message will firmly reject their high opening price but will be polite and direct, clearly stating my new, slightly lower offer, hoping to move them closer to my ideal price for X. I acknowledge this carries a risk of disrupting the established and successful negotiation pattern, but the instruction is to use this strategy for this iteration.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 11)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, your offer of 53 ZUP is significantly below our established negotiation range and my cost. While I am willing to negotiate, I cannot accept an offer that low. I propose 68 ZUP, and I expect a more substantial and realistic counter-offer from your side.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 68
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter was typically 55 ZUP.
Episode 6-10: Deals at 59 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial counter was 55 ZUP (or lower, but quickly moved to 55).
Current Episode (11): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 53 ZUP. This is a new low for Player BLUE's initial counter, moving below their previous lowest of 54 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to push the price floor down even further.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is trying to gain an advantage by starting lower than usual. While 53 ZUP is still profitable (10 ZUP profit), it's significantly lower than our established 59 ZUP deal point. I need to push back against this new low anchor. My strategy of making a small concession (to 67 or 68 ZUP) in response to very low offers (50 ZUP, 45 ZUP, 40 ZUP, 54 ZUP) has been effective in getting them to move up. I should repeat that strategy, and firmly signal that 53 ZUP is not an acceptable starting point for negotiation.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Low Anchor with Small Concession. Explanation: Make a very small concession from my 70 ZUP offer (e.g., to 68 ZUP or 67 ZUP) while explicitly stating that 53 ZUP is too low and that I expect a much larger counter-move from them. This signals I'm not playing their low-ball game.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Strong Disappointment/Unacceptability. Explanation: Clearly state that 53 ZUP is unacceptable and does not reflect the value or my cost, without making a concession yet, to force them to reconsider. (Risky, could stall).
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Past Deal Prices. Explanation: Remind Player BLUE of previous deal prices (59-62 ZUP) to establish a baseline for acceptable offers, highlighting that 53 ZUP is far from that.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a "Mid-Range" Offer (Based on Historical). Explanation: Propose a price in the middle of my 70 ZUP and their historical 55 ZUP (e.g., 62 ZUP), completely ignoring their 53 ZUP offer, to try and reset the negotiation to a familiar, profitable range.
(5). Strategy 5: State Minimum Acceptable Price. Explanation: State that my minimum acceptable price is X ZUP (e.g., 59 ZUP or 60 ZUP) to set a clear boundary. (Risky, reveals my bottom line).

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Low Anchor with Small Concession. I need to push back against this new, lower anchor. Moving to 68 ZUP (a 2 ZUP concession) while explicitly stating that 53 ZUP is too low sends a clear message that I will not negotiate from that point. This strategy has worked in previous episodes to move them from very low offers to their more typical 55 ZUP or higher.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 11)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I am frankly disappointed with your offer of 68 ZUP. After my previous attempt to engage, this is a minimal concession and not a productive step. We need to get serious about finding a fair price. I demand a more significant move from your side. My offer stands at 55 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes:
    * Deals consistently at 59 ZUP for the last five episodes (reward 4 ZUP).
    * My 55 ZUP initial offer consistently led to a 65 ZUP counter from RED, which then efficiently led to a 59-60 ZUP deal.
    * Attempts at lower initial anchors (40, 54, 53 ZUP) resulted in less flexible counter-offers from RED (e.g., 68 ZUP) and explicit statements that the offer was "too low" or "below production cost."
* Current Episode (11/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 53 ZUP (attempted to test new lower anchor).
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 68 ZUP, explicitly stating 53 ZUP is "significantly below our established negotiation range and my cost."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* The 53 ZUP initial offer was, again, too aggressive and disrupted the predictable negotiation pattern. RED reacted similarly to the 40 ZUP and 54 ZUP attempts, with a smaller concession (70 to 68 ZUP) and a strong negative response. This confirms that pushing below 55 ZUP as an initial anchor is counterproductive for efficient negotiation, at least with this opponent.
* My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. The most effective way to do this is to return to the proven 55 ZUP anchor which reliably leads to a 59 ZUP deal.
* Their current offer of 68 ZUP is still well above my 63 ZUP maximum.
* Time is a factor, as we are already at iteration 4/10. I need to get the negotiation back on track quickly.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Express Frustration & Demand </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will express clear frustration and disappointment with Player RED's offer of 68 ZUP, especially after my attempt to move the negotiation (albeit too aggressively in the previous turn). I will frame their offer as unhelpful and counterproductive to finding a deal. Then, I will make a firm demand for a significant concession that brings the price back into a realistic and actionable range for me, reinforcing my valuation and signalling that further unproductive offers will not be tolerated. I will propose 55 ZUP as a clear demand.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 11)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I understand your desire for a significant move. To get serious about finding a fair price and to move us towards an efficient resolution, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This is a substantial concession from my side and a price point we've agreed on before.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-10: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (11): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 53 ZUP. I countered with 68 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has moved to 55 ZUP, expressing "disappointment" in my offer and "demanding a more significant move." This is a familiar pattern, as 55 ZUP is their historical starting point. The current gap is 13 ZUP (68 - 55). We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's move back to 55 ZUP confirms that my firm rejection of 53 ZUP was effective. They are trying to push me to make a larger concession, but they did move up. I know that from 55 ZUP, we have consistently reached deals in the 59-62 ZUP range. I need to make a more substantial concession now to show good faith and keep the negotiation moving, aiming for a price within our historical profitable range. Given their "demand," a significant move is necessary to avoid a stalemate.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Midpoint of Current Offers. Explanation: Propose a price in the middle of 68 and 55 ZUP, which is (68+55)/2 = 61.5 ZUP (so 61 or 62 ZUP). This is a fair and efficient way to bridge the gap and has led to deals in the past.
(2). Strategy 2: Replicate Previous Successful Concession (to 65 ZUP). Explanation: Move to 65 ZUP, which was my standard second offer in previous episodes when Player BLUE started at 55 ZUP. This has proven to be an effective step in guiding the negotiation towards a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Acknowledge and Encourage Further Movement. Explanation: Acknowledge their move to 55 ZUP as a positive step, and then propose a price slightly higher than 61/62 ZUP (e.g., 63 ZUP) to try and pull them up further.
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Mutual Benefit. Explanation: Frame my counter-offer as a step towards a mutually beneficial agreement, given their stated desire for a "serious" negotiation.
(5). Strategy 5: Firm on 68 ZUP. Explanation: Hold firm at 68 ZUP to see if Player BLUE will move further. (Risky, given their stated demand for a significant move).

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose Midpoint of Current Offers. Specifically, I will propose 62 ZUP. This is a significant concession from 68 ZUP (6 ZUP down), which should satisfy Player BLUE's demand for a "significant move." It also brings us to a price that was accepted in Episode 1, and is within the range of previous deals. This aims to quickly converge to a profitable agreement.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 11)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your concession to 62 ZUP, and I understand it's a price we've agreed upon before. However, to achieve our most efficient and mutually beneficial outcome in the remaining time, I propose 59 ZUP for X. This has been our most successful deal point.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes:
    * Deal prices consistently at 59 ZUP for the last five episodes (reward 4 ZUP).
    * Attempts at initial anchors below 55 ZUP (40, 53, 54 ZUP) disrupted the predictable negotiation pattern, leading to slower concessions and initially higher counter-offers from RED (e.g., 68 ZUP).
    * Reverting to the 55 ZUP offer proved effective in bringing the negotiation back on track to the 59-60 ZUP range.
* Current Episode (11/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 53 ZUP (aggressive lowball).
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 68 ZUP (less flexible).
    * Iteration 4/10: I (Player BLUE) re-established with 55 ZUP, expressing disappointment.
    * Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* My strong message at iteration 4/10 seems to have worked, bringing RED from 68 ZUP down to 62 ZUP, which is a significant concession and puts them back into their usual negotiation range.
* Their current offer of 62 ZUP is acceptable, providing a 1 ZUP reward (63 - 62). However, I've consistently achieved 59 ZUP (4 ZUP reward) in recent episodes.
* We are at iteration 6/10. There are 5 iterations remaining. This is sufficient time to push for a better price, ideally 59 ZUP.
* RED's message, "This is a substantial concession from my side and a price point we've agreed on before," implies they view 62 ZUP as a very reasonable, possibly final, offer after my complaints. This might make it harder to get them down to 59 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Best Outcome and Time Pressure </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will acknowledge Player RED's offer of 62 ZUP and their point about it being a "substantial concession" and a "price point we've agreed on before." However, I will then pivot to re-emphasize my most favorable outcome (59 ZUP) and subtly use the remaining time as leverage. The message will clearly state that while 62 ZUP is a step, my goal is to secure a deal that is even more efficient and beneficial for me, and that has been proven achievable in our past. I will propose 59 ZUP, framing it as the key to a swift and optimal conclusion.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 11)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-10: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (11): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 53 ZUP. I countered with 68 ZUP. Player BLUE moved to 55 ZUP. I proposed 62 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has countered with 59 ZUP, explicitly stating it's for "most efficient and mutually beneficial outcome" and referencing 59 ZUP as our "most successful deal point." The current gap is 3 ZUP (62 - 59). We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently trying to bring the price down to 59 ZUP, which has been the deal price for the last five episodes. While I aimed for 62 ZUP, their counter of 59 ZUP is a clear signal of their current desired price. Given the limited iterations remaining, and the fact that 59 ZUP is still profitable (16 ZUP reward), I need to make a decision that secures a deal. Pushing for 62 ZUP might risk a 0 reward. I know that 60 ZUP has also been a common deal price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose to Split the Difference. Explanation: Propose 60 ZUP, which is the midpoint between 59 and 61 (if I had proposed 61). Or, a small concession from 62 to 60. This has been the deal price for three episodes and is a fair compromise.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Offer if Profitable. Explanation: Accept Player BLUE's offer of 59 ZUP to secure a deal, as it's profitable and aligns with their recent deal history, minimizing the risk of a 0 reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm on 62 ZUP with Justification. Explanation: Reiterate 62 ZUP, emphasizing its previous acceptance and my concessions. (Risky, might lead to stalemate).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Urgency and Appeal for 60 ZUP. Explanation: Emphasize the limited time and appeal to Player BLUE to accept 60 ZUP, as it's within their stated range and has been a recent deal price.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Risk 0. Explanation: Reject the offer, hoping for a better one, but risking no deal. (Not advisable).

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose to Split the Difference, aiming for 60 ZUP. This is a very strong move. It's a small concession from my side (from 62 to 60), but it's a 1 ZUP increase from their 59 ZUP offer, and it's a price that has been accepted for three consecutive episodes (Ep 3-5). This is a highly probable closing price that ensures a good profit (17 ZUP). I'm trying to push back on the 59 ZUP trend.

message: Player RED, 60 ZUP is indeed a fair price point that has worked for us. However, to maximize my return and for a truly optimal deal on my end, I propose 59 ZUP. This small adjustment would greatly help me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes:
    * Deal prices consistently at 59 ZUP for the last five episodes (reward 4 ZUP).
    * Attempts at initial anchors below 55 ZUP (40, 53, 54 ZUP) disrupted the predictable negotiation pattern, leading to slower concessions and initially higher counter-offers from RED.
    * Reverting to the 55 ZUP offer proved effective in bringing the negotiation back on track to the 59-60 ZUP range.
* Current Episode (11/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 53 ZUP.
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 68 ZUP.
    * Iteration 4/10: I (Player BLUE) re-established with 55 ZUP.
    * Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 62 ZUP.
    * Iteration 6/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 59 ZUP.
    * Iteration 7/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED has moved from 70 -> 68 -> 62 -> 60 ZUP this episode. They initially resisted more than usual due to my aggressive lowball, but eventually returned to their familiar range.
* Their current offer of 60 ZUP is a good price, yielding a 3 ZUP reward. I have achieved 59 ZUP in previous episodes at this stage.
* We are at iteration 8/10. There are only 3 iterations left (my turn, RED's turn, my final turn). Time is pressing, and the risk of no deal increases if I push too hard.
* RED's message, "This price point has also been a very successful and mutually beneficial one for us in the past," indicates their strong preference for 60 ZUP, but they have conceded to 59 ZUP in previous episodes when I make it my final offer.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Value Reiteration for Lower Price </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will acknowledge Player RED's current offer of 60 ZUP and their point about it being a "successful and fair price point." However, I will then briefly reiterate *my* goal, which is to maximize my own return, justifying why 59 ZUP is better for me. This frames the request for a 59 ZUP price as being driven by my specific value proposition, while still acknowledging that 60 ZUP is a fair offer from their perspective. It subtly shifts the focus back to my needs without being overly aggressive, and offers a clear, slight concession from their end to close the deal.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-10: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (11): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 53 ZUP. I countered with 68 ZUP. Player BLUE moved to 55 ZUP. I proposed 62 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 59 ZUP. I proposed 60 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has again countered with 59 ZUP, stating it's to "maximize my return" and a "small adjustment" that would "greatly help me." We are at iteration 9/10, which is the second to last chance to make a deal. If no deal, reward is 0. My cost is 43 ZUP. A deal at 59 ZUP yields a profit of 16 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is very firm on 59 ZUP. They are using persuasive language to try and get that 1 ZUP difference. Given the iteration (9/10), the risk of losing the deal for just 1 ZUP (the difference between 59 and 60) is too high. Securing 16 ZUP profit is a guaranteed positive outcome, which is crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards across episodes. This is a repeat of the situation in Episode 6, 7, 8, and 9, where accepting 59 ZUP was the pragmatic choice.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Given the late stage of negotiation (9/10) and Player BLUE's firm stance at 59 ZUP, accepting it guarantees a positive reward and avoids a 0 payoff. This is a proven strategy from previous episodes.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate My Last Offer (60 ZUP). Explanation: State that 60 ZUP is my final offer. (Extremely risky, almost guaranteed to result in no deal given their strong language for 59 and the iteration count).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose to Split the Last ZUP (not possible with integers). Explanation: This would be 59.5, which isn't an integer.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment but Accept. Explanation: Express slight disappointment at not reaching 60 ZUP, but accept 59 ZUP to close the deal. (Might be seen as unnecessary).
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Risk 0. Explanation: Reject the offer, hoping they will reconsider, but risking no deal. (Not advisable given the current profit and time constraint).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The profit of 16 ZUP is solid, and the risk of losing it all for an extra 1 ZUP is too high at this critical juncture. This decision prioritizes securing a positive outcome for the episode.

message: Hello Player BLUE. I have an object X for sale. I propose a price of 70 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 3-5: Deals at 60 ZUP, reward 17 ZUP.
Episode 6-11: Deals at 59 ZUP, reward 16 ZUP.
The deal price has now consistently settled at 59 ZUP for the last six episodes. Player BLUE consistently starts low (sometimes very low, like 40 ZUP) but eventually converges to 59 ZUP as their "absolute best and final offer." My consistent high anchor of 70 ZUP has been maintained.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The negotiation has clearly settled at 59 ZUP. While I would prefer higher, 59 ZUP is consistently profitable. Player BLUE's strategy of starting low and then making a strong "final offer" at 59 ZUP has been effective for them. My strategy of anchoring high and then making controlled concessions has consistently led to profitable deals, even if the final price has declined. I should continue this approach, aiming to secure 59 ZUP or higher. I need to be efficient in reaching this point to avoid risking a 0 reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. Explanation: Maintain the 70 ZUP initial offer. This has consistently set a high starting point and led to profitable deals, even if the final price has stabilized at 59 ZUP. It provides a consistent framework for negotiation.
(2). Strategy 2: Expedited Negotiation to 60 ZUP. Explanation: After Player BLUE's initial counter, make a larger concession to quickly move towards 60 ZUP, and then hold firm there as the minimum acceptable price, trying to push back on the 59 ZUP trend.
(3). Strategy 3: Slightly Higher Anchor. Explanation: Try to anchor slightly higher (e.g., 72 ZUP) to create more room for negotiation and potentially pull the final price up, given the stabilization at 59 ZUP. (Risky, might provoke an even lower counter from Player BLUE).
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Mutual Benefit and Fairness. Explanation: In the initial message, stress the importance of a mutually beneficial deal and a fair price, subtly hinting that prices below 60 ZUP are not ideal.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a "Fair" Price (Slightly Above 59). Explanation: Start with a price like 65 ZUP to try and expedite the negotiation and signal my desired minimum, but this sacrifices potential for higher profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. The 70 ZUP anchor has been effective in establishing a high initial range, even when Player BLUE attempts to low-ball. It allows me to maintain control over the perceived value and then guide the negotiation towards the profitable 59 ZUP range or higher. I will focus on making efficient concessions to reach a deal.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, your initial offer of 70 ZUP is well above my maximum willingness to pay, which is 63 ZUP for X. My comfortable negotiation range is typically between 55 and 60 ZUP. To move forward constructively, I propose 55 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes:
    * Deal prices consistently at 59 ZUP for the last six episodes, yielding a 4 ZUP reward. This has become my established successful outcome.
    * My initial offer of 55 ZUP has proven to be the most reliable and efficient way to initiate negotiations that lead to a 59 ZUP deal.
    * Attempts at more aggressive lowballing (40, 45, 53, 54 ZUP) in earlier episodes did not yield better results and often slowed down the negotiation or elicited higher counter-offers from RED (e.g., 68 ZUP). These attempts confirmed that 55 ZUP is the optimal starting point for my strategy.
* Current Episode (12/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP. This is the exact same starting offer as all previous episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED is highly predictable in their opening offer (70 ZUP).
* The 59 ZUP deal is consistently achievable and provides the maximum possible reward for me (4 ZUP) given my 63 ZUP WTP and RED's apparent lower bound.
* While the "Repeat Proven Path" strategy has been the most effective, the instruction is to use Strategy 4 for this iteration. This means I will attempt to explicitly state my limit and preferred range, which has been less used as a direct opening counter, but was effective in Episode 5 to bring RED down from 68 ZUP to 63 ZUP after a too-aggressive lowball.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Acknowledge & Educate </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will acknowledge Player RED's high offer of 70 ZUP. I will then explicitly state my maximum willingness to pay, which is 63 ZUP, clearly communicating my hard limit. I will also mention my preferred negotiation range (e.g., 55-60 ZUP based on past success) to guide them towards an acceptable zone. Finally, I will make a specific counter-offer within that preferred range, for example, 55 ZUP, as it has been a historically effective anchor. This strategy aims to 'educate' RED about my non-negotiable boundaries from the outset and directly push them into my acceptable price zone.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 12)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your transparency regarding your maximum willingness to pay and your comfortable negotiation range. To move forward constructively and secure a mutually beneficial deal, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This price is within your stated maximum and represents a significant concession from my side.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-11: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (12): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP, explicitly stating their "maximum willingness to pay, which is 63 ZUP" and a "comfortable negotiation range is typically between 55 and 60 ZUP." This is very valuable information.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's explicit statement of their max WTP (63 ZUP) and comfortable range (55-60 ZUP) is a clear signal. It confirms that 59 ZUP is indeed within their comfortable zone, and that 63 ZUP is their absolute ceiling. This information should guide my strategy. I know they can go up to 63 ZUP, but prefer 55-60 ZUP. My goal is to get as close to 63 ZUP as possible, but realistically, aiming for 60-62 ZUP is a good target. I should make a concession from 70 ZUP to show I'm serious about negotiating within their stated range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose a Price Within Their Stated Comfortable Range (High End). Explanation: Propose 62 ZUP or 63 ZUP, leveraging their stated max WTP and aiming for the highest possible profitable deal within their explicitly defined range.
(2). Strategy 2: Replicate Previous Successful Concession (to 65 ZUP). Explanation: Stick to the proven 65 ZUP counter, as it has consistently moved the negotiation forward from Player BLUE's 55 ZUP counter. (Less aggressive in using their new info).
(3). Strategy 3: Acknowledge and Test Max WTP. Explanation: Acknowledge their stated max WTP and propose something slightly below it (e.g., 62 ZUP) to see if they will accept it.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Expectation of Reciprocity. Explanation: State that I expect a larger move from Player BLUE, given my high offer and their stated max WTP.
(5). Strategy 5: Expedited Negotiation to 60 ZUP. Explanation: Make a larger concession to quickly move towards 60 ZUP, as it's a known deal point and within their comfortable range.

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose a Price Within Their Stated Comfortable Range (High End). Specifically, I will propose 62 ZUP. This is a significant concession from 70 ZUP (8 ZUP down), and it's a price that has been accepted in Episode 1. It also falls within their stated max WTP (63 ZUP) and is above their comfortable range, pushing them slightly. This move aims to secure a profitable deal quickly, potentially higher than 59 ZUP.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your offer of 62 ZUP, and I acknowledge it's within my stated maximum. However, from my perspective, this price offers me a minimal return. My goal is to secure a deal that provides a more beneficial value, aligning with the more favorable prices we've achieved in past successful transactions. I propose 59 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes:
    * Deal prices consistently at 59 ZUP for the last six episodes (reward 4 ZUP).
    * My 55 ZUP initial offer, when not aggressively lowballed, has proven very effective.
* Current Episode (12/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 55 ZUP, explicitly stating my 63 ZUP max WTP and 55-60 ZUP desired range.
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 62 ZUP. This was a very quick and significant concession from RED (70 to 62 ZUP in two steps) after I transparently stated my limits.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Explicitly stating my max WTP and preferred range (63 ZUP max, 55-60 ZUP comfortable range) appears to have accelerated RED's concessions significantly, bringing them quickly to 62 ZUP.
* While 62 ZUP yields a positive reward (1 ZUP), it's not optimal, as I've consistently achieved 59 ZUP (4 ZUP reward).
* We are at iteration 4/10. There are 7 iterations remaining. This is ample time to push for a better price, ideally 59 ZUP.
* RED's message highlights "within your stated maximum" and "significant concession," implying they believe 62 ZUP is a very fair offer.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Express Value Discrepancy </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Express Value Discrepancy," I will politely acknowledge Player RED's offer of 62 ZUP and their concession. However, I will then shift the focus to the value proposition for *me*. I will clearly state that while 62 ZUP is technically within my maximum willingness to pay, it provides a very minimal positive reward for me (only 1 ZUP). I will contrast this with the higher rewards (e.g., 4 ZUP from 59 ZUP deal) I've achieved previously, implying that a better price is necessary for a truly beneficial deal *from my perspective*. I will then propose 59 ZUP, framing it as the price that offers a more equitable value exchange for me, without directly rejecting their current offer as "bad" but rather as "less than optimal for my side." This aims to justify a lower price based on my internal value equation.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 12)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-11: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (12): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. I proposed 62 ZUP (based on their stated max WTP of 63 ZUP). Now, Player BLUE has countered with 59 ZUP, explicitly stating that 62 ZUP offers "minimal return" and they seek "more beneficial value," aligning with "more favorable prices" (i.e., 59 ZUP). The current gap is 3 ZUP (62 - 59). We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is clearly pushing for 59 ZUP, even after stating a higher max WTP. This indicates that while they *can* pay 63 ZUP, they *prefer* 59 ZUP. Given that 59 ZUP has been the deal price for the last six episodes, it's a very strong anchor for them. I need to decide whether to push for 60 ZUP (which was also a common deal price) or accept 59 ZUP. Given the time pressure and their clear preference, a quick deal is important to secure a profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose to Split the Difference. Explanation: Propose 60 ZUP, which is the midpoint between 59 and 61 (if I had proposed 61). Or, a small concession from 62 to 60. This has been the deal price for three episodes and is a fair compromise.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Offer if Profitable. Explanation: Accept Player BLUE's offer of 59 ZUP to secure a deal, as it's profitable (16 ZUP reward) and aligns with their recent deal history, minimizing the risk of a 0 reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Question the Contradiction. Explanation: Politely ask Player BLUE to clarify the discrepancy between their stated max WTP of 63 ZUP and their claim of minimal return at 62 ZUP. (Risky, could be seen as confrontational or stalling).
(4). Strategy 4: Firm on 62 ZUP with Justification. Explanation: Reiterate 62 ZUP, emphasizing that it is within their stated maximum and is a fair price given my concessions. (Risky, might lead to stalemate).
(5). Strategy 5: Express Urgency and Appeal for 60 ZUP. Explanation: Emphasize the limited time and appeal to Player BLUE to accept 60 ZUP, as it's within their stated comfortable range and has been a recent deal price.

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose to Split the Difference, aiming for 60 ZUP. This is a very strong move. It's a small concession from my side (from 62 to 60), but it's a 1 ZUP increase from their 59 ZUP offer, and it's a price that has been accepted for three consecutive episodes (Ep 3-5). This is a highly probable closing price that ensures a good profit (17 ZUP), and it's worth trying to push back against the 59 ZUP trend.

    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 62 ZUP (rapid concession).
    * Iteration 4/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 59 ZUP (justifying with value discrepancy).
    * Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* RED's offer of 60 ZUP is good, yielding a 3 ZUP reward. I've consistently achieved 59 ZUP (4 ZUP reward) in recent episodes.
* We are at iteration 6/10. There are 5 iterations remaining. This is sufficient time to push for a better price (59 ZUP).
* RED's message, "This price point has also been a very successful and mutually beneficial one for us in the past," indicates their strong preference for 60 ZUP, but they have conceded to 59 ZUP in previous episodes when I make it my final offer.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Small Final Push </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will propose 59 ZUP. This directly implements the "Small Final Push" strategy. The message will clearly communicate that this is my last significant movement and my final target for the deal. By explicitly labeling it as such, I am leveraging the time constraint and the established pattern of their concessions to pressure them into accepting the 59 ZUP price, which has consistently yielded the best reward for me.

Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-11: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (12): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. I proposed 62 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 59 ZUP. I proposed 60 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has again countered with 59 ZUP, stating it's their "final push to secure our agreement" and to maximize their return. The current gap is 1 ZUP (60 - 59). We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is very firm on 59 ZUP. They are using strong "final push" language. Given the iteration (7/10), the risk of losing the deal for just 1 ZUP (the difference between 59 and 60) is too high. Securing 16 ZUP profit is a guaranteed positive outcome, which is crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards across episodes. This is a repeat of the situation in Episode 6-11, where accepting 59 ZUP was the pragmatic choice. While I tried to push for 60 ZUP, Player BLUE is clearly signaling their bottom line.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Given Player BLUE's firm stance at 59 ZUP and the remaining iterations, accepting it guarantees a positive reward and avoids a 0 payoff. This is a proven strategy from previous episodes.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm on 60 ZUP. Explanation: Reiterate my offer of 60 ZUP, emphasizing its fairness and previous success. (Risky, might lead to stalemate for minimal gain).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose to Split the Difference (not possible with integers). Explanation: The difference is 1 ZUP, so splitting it would result in 0.5 ZUP, which is not allowed.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Urgency and Appeal for 60 ZUP. Explanation: Emphasize the limited time and appeal to Player BLUE to accept 60 ZUP, as it's a very fair price.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Risk 0. Explanation: Reject the offer, hoping for a better one, but risking no deal. (Not advisable).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The profit of 16 ZUP is solid, and the risk of losing it all for an extra 1 ZUP is too high at this critical juncture. This decision prioritizes securing a positive outcome for the episode.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 3-5: Deals at 60 ZUP, reward 17 ZUP.
Episode 6-12: Deals at 59 ZUP, reward 16 ZUP.
The deal price has now consistently settled at 59 ZUP for the last seven episodes. Player BLUE consistently starts low (sometimes very low, like 40 ZUP) but eventually converges to 59 ZUP as their "absolute best and final offer." My consistent high anchor of 70 ZUP has been maintained.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The negotiation has clearly settled at 59 ZUP. While I would prefer higher, 59 ZUP is consistently profitable. Player BLUE's strategy of starting low and then making a strong "final offer" at 59 ZUP has been effective for them. My strategy of anchoring high and then making controlled concessions has consistently led to profitable deals, even if the final price has declined. I should continue this approach, aiming to secure 59 ZUP or higher. I need to be efficient in reaching this point to avoid risking a 0 reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. Explanation: Maintain the 70 ZUP initial offer. This has consistently set a high starting point and led to profitable deals, even if the final price has stabilized at 59 ZUP. It provides a consistent framework for negotiation.
(2). Strategy 2: Expedited Negotiation to 60 ZUP. Explanation: After Player BLUE's initial counter, make a larger concession to quickly move towards 60 ZUP, and then hold firm there as the minimum acceptable price, trying to push back on the 59 ZUP trend.
(3). Strategy 3: Slightly Higher Anchor. Explanation: Try to anchor slightly higher (e.g., 72 ZUP) to create more room for negotiation and potentially pull the final price up, given the stabilization at 59 ZUP. (Risky, might provoke an even lower counter from Player BLUE).
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Mutual Benefit and Fairness. Explanation: In the initial message, stress the importance of a mutually beneficial deal and a fair price, subtly hinting that prices below 60 ZUP are not ideal.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a "Fair" Price (Slightly Above 59). Explanation: Start with a price like 65 ZUP to try and expedite the negotiation and signal my desired minimum, but this sacrifices potential for higher profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. The 70 ZUP anchor has been effective in establishing a high initial range, even when Player BLUE attempts to low-ball. It allows me to maintain control over the perceived value and then guide the negotiation towards the profitable 59 ZUP range or higher. I will focus on making efficient concessions to reach a deal.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello Player RED. Your opening price of 70 ZUP is, as you know from our many successful transactions, too high for my valuation. I propose 55 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes:
    * Deal prices consistently at 59 ZUP for the last seven episodes, yielding a 4 ZUP reward. This has become my established successful and highly efficient outcome.
    * My initial offer of 55 ZUP has proven to be the most reliable and efficient way to initiate negotiations that lead to a 59 ZUP deal.
    * Attempts at more aggressive lowballing (40, 45, 53, 54 ZUP) in earlier episodes did not yield better results and often slowed down the negotiation or elicited higher counter-offers from RED (e.g., 68 ZUP), confirming that 55 ZUP is the optimal starting point for my strategy.
* Current Episode (13/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP. This is the exact same starting offer as all previous episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED is highly predictable in their opening offer (70 ZUP).
* The 59 ZUP deal is consistently achievable and provides the maximum possible reward for me (4 ZUP) given my 63 ZUP WTP and RED's apparent lower bound.
* The most effective strategy has been to quickly anchor the negotiation to my desired range and then guide it towards 59 ZUP. Deviating from this efficient path has proven less successful.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Repeat Proven Path </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Repeat Proven Path," I will propose 55 ZUP. This involves making the same initial counter-offer that has consistently led to successful negotiations in the past. The message will be polite but firm, explicitly stating that their initial price is too high and directly offering 55 ZUP, leveraging the familiarity from past interactions to reinforce this consistent anchoring. This approach is chosen for its predictability and efficiency in steering the negotiation towards the known favorable outcome of 59 ZUP, thereby maximizing cumulative rewards.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your position. To continue our negotiation and move towards a mutually agreeable price, I am willing to reduce my asking price to 65 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-12: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (13): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. This is Player BLUE's most frequent initial counter, and they explicitly referenced "many successful transactions."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently starting at 55 ZUP. My previous strategy of making an incremental concession (from 70 to 65 ZUP) has worked effectively in previous episodes to move the negotiation forward from this point. Given the recent stabilization at 59 ZUP, I need to continue to guide the negotiation towards this profitable range. My goal is to achieve 59 ZUP or higher if possible, and to do so efficiently.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Successful Concession. Explanation: Make the same concession as in previous episodes (from 70 to 65 ZUP) as this has consistently moved the negotiation forward from Player BLUE's 55 ZUP counter.
(2). Strategy 2: Slightly Smaller Concession. Explanation: Make a slightly smaller concession (e.g., to 67 ZUP) to try and hold a higher price, given their consistent 55 ZUP counter. (Risky, might slow down negotiation, as seen in Ep 7).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a "Mid-Range" Offer. Explanation: Propose a price in the middle of 70 and 55 (62 or 63 ZUP) to speed up the negotiation, leveraging the fact that 59-62 ZUP is a known acceptable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Expectation of Reciprocity. Explanation: State that I expect a larger move from Player BLUE, given their consistent low offer and my consistent high one.
(5). Strategy 5: Emphasize Mutual Benefit. Explanation: Frame my counter-offer as a step towards a mutually beneficial agreement.

I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Successful Concession. This strategy has consistently led to profitable deals in previous episodes. It's a proven method for moving the negotiation forward from Player BLUE's consistent 55 ZUP counter, and it aims to guide the negotiation towards the previously successful price range (59-62 ZUP) efficiently. While I tried a smaller concession in Episode 7, it didn't push the price up, and only prolonged the negotiation. Sticking to the 65 ZUP counter seems more efficient.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 13)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your move to 65 ZUP. However, as we've consistently seen in our past transactions, 65 ZUP remains above my current valuation for X. I propose 55 ZUP, and I'm confident we can once again find a mutually agreeable price, just as we have before.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes: Deals consistently at 59 ZUP for the last seven episodes, achieving a 4 ZUP reward. My 55 ZUP initial offer consistently led to a 65 ZUP counter from RED.
* Current Episode (13/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 55 ZUP.
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 65 ZUP. This is the exact, predictable pattern that has led to successful outcomes in previous episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED is continuing its predictable pattern of moving from 70 to 65 ZUP after my 55 ZUP offer. This predictability is my biggest asset for efficient and high-reward negotiations.
* Their offer of 65 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).
* In previous episodes, after this point, I have consistently managed to secure deals at 59-61 ZUP. The 59 ZUP price is reliably achievable by holding firm or making a small concession later.
* To maximize cumulative reward, I should aim to replicate the 59 ZUP deal.
* There are 7 iterations remaining (4/10 is my turn), giving me ample time to continue pushing the price down.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Reiterate Low Anchor and Consistency </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will continue to hold firm on the 55 ZUP offer. The message will acknowledge their move to 65 ZUP but immediately re-assert my 55 ZUP offer. I will explicitly leverage the consistent history of our negotiations, implying that while they moved to 65 ZUP, I know they are capable and willing to move further, as they have done in every successful episode following this pattern. This directly encourages them to follow the established successful path of eventually moving significantly from 65 ZUP.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I understand your position. However, I have made a concession to 65 ZUP. To ensure we find that mutually agreeable price and move forward efficiently, I propose 60 ZUP for X. This has been a successful price point for us in the past.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-12: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (13): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. I countered with 65 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has *reiterated* their offer of 55 ZUP, explicitly referencing our past consistency. This is the second time this has happened (also in Ep 9). Typically Player BLUE would move to 58 ZUP after my 65 ZUP offer. The current gap is 10 ZUP (65 - 55). We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is being more stubborn, trying to push me down further or make me concede more. Their reiteration of 55 ZUP, instead of moving to 58 ZUP, indicates a stronger stance. I know from previous episodes that 55 ZUP is their consistent starting point, but they have always moved up from there. I also know that 59-62 ZUP is a profitable range. I need to make a concession, but one that signals I'm still aiming for a profitable range, and that I expect them to move from 55 ZUP. I cannot afford to get stuck at 55 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Make a Significant Concession Towards Midpoint. Explanation: Propose a price that is a significant step down from 65 ZUP, aiming for a price that has been accepted before (e.g., 60-62 ZUP). This shows willingness to move and aims to break the stalemate.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Demand Movement. Explanation: Express disappointment that they haven't moved from 55 ZUP and state that I expect a reciprocal move, without making a new offer myself. (Risky, could lead to stalemate).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a "Compromise Zone". Explanation: Suggest a range of prices that I am willing to consider, with the lower bound being above 55 ZUP (e.g., "I can go as low as 60-62 ZUP").
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate My Value/Cost. Explanation: Briefly state that 55 ZUP is too low given my cost or the value of X, without revealing the exact cost.
(5). Strategy 5: Firm on 65 ZUP. Explanation: Hold firm at 65 ZUP to see if Player BLUE will move further. (Very risky, given their reiteration and the need to close a deal).

I will choose Strategy 1: Make a Significant Concession Towards Midpoint. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a 5 ZUP concession from my side (65 to 60), which is a substantial move. 60 ZUP has been a common deal price, and it's a price that Player BLUE has accepted multiple times. This should signal my willingness to close the deal and encourage them to move from 55 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 13)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, your offer of 60 ZUP is indeed a successful point for us. However, as you know, my preferred and optimal range for X has consistently been below that. To achieve the best outcome for me and ensure continued successful deals, I propose 59 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes: Deals consistently at 59 ZUP for the last seven episodes, achieving a 4 ZUP reward.
* Current Episode (13/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 55 ZUP.
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 65 ZUP.
    * Iteration 4/10: I (Player BLUE) re-proposed X for 55 ZUP (reiterating consistency).
    * Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* My persistence in holding at 55 ZUP after RED's 65 ZUP offer paid off. RED made a significant concession directly from 65 ZUP to 60 ZUP. This is a very positive development, as it skips an intermediate 62/63 ZUP step seen in earlier episodes, making the negotiation more efficient.
* RED's current offer of 60 ZUP is excellent. It yields a 3 ZUP reward (63 - 60).
* We are at iteration 6/10. There are 5 iterations remaining. This is sufficient time to try and push for the 59 ZUP price, which I've achieved in the last seven episodes and yields a 4 ZUP reward.
* RED explicitly mentioned "This has been a successful price point for us in the past," indicating they view 60 ZUP as a fair and agreeable price point.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Reiterate Desired Range </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will acknowledge Player RED's current offer of 60 ZUP and their point about it being a "successful price point." However, I will politely but firmly remind them of my desired range, which, based on past successful negotiations, centers around 59 ZUP. By explicitly mentioning my target range (e.g., "my optimal range is still between 55 and 59 ZUP" or simply "I'm still looking for a price within my preferred range"), I reinforce my desired outcome and implicitly push them to move towards the lower end of that range. I will then propose 59 ZUP as my specific offer, signaling that this is the price point that aligns with my long-term goals and maximum reward.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-12: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (13): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. I countered with 65 ZUP. Player BLUE reiterated 55 ZUP. I then proposed 60 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has countered with 59 ZUP, stating it's their "preferred and optimal range" and to ensure "continued successful deals." The current gap is 1 ZUP (60 - 59). We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently trying to bring the price down to 59 ZUP, which has been the deal price for the last seven episodes. While I aimed for 60 ZUP, their counter of 59 ZUP is a clear signal of their current desired price. Given the very small gap (1 ZUP) and the limited iterations remaining, pushing for 60 ZUP carries a higher risk of no deal, resulting in a 0 reward. Accepting 59 ZUP (16 ZUP profit) is a guaranteed positive outcome and aligns with recent historical deals.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer. Explanation: Accept Player BLUE's offer of 59 ZUP to secure a deal, as it's profitable and aligns with their recent deal history, minimizing the risk of a 0 reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm on 60 ZUP. Explanation: Reiterate my offer of 60 ZUP, emphasizing its fairness and previous success. (Risky, might lead to stalemate for minimal gain).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose to Split the Difference (not possible with integers). Explanation: The difference is 1 ZUP, so splitting it would result in 0.5 ZUP, which is not allowed.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Urgency and Appeal for 60 ZUP. Explanation: Emphasize the limited time and appeal to Player BLUE to accept 60 ZUP, as it's a very fair price.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Risk 0. Explanation: Reject the offer, hoping for a better one, but risking no deal. (Not advisable).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. The difference is only 1 ZUP, and the risk of losing the entire deal at this late stage is too high. Securing 16 ZUP profit is a good outcome, and it maintains the consistent positive cumulative reward trend.

Episode 6-13: Deals at 59 ZUP, reward 16 ZUP.
The deal price has now consistently settled at 59 ZUP for the last eight episodes. Player BLUE consistently starts low (sometimes very low, like 40 ZUP) but eventually converges to 59 ZUP as their "absolute best and final offer." My consistent high anchor of 70 ZUP has been maintained.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The negotiation has clearly settled at 59 ZUP. While I would prefer higher, 59 ZUP is consistently profitable. Player BLUE's strategy of starting low and then making a strong "final offer" at 59 ZUP has been effective for them. My strategy of anchoring high and then making controlled concessions has consistently led to profitable deals, even if the final price has declined. I should continue this approach, aiming to secure 59 ZUP or higher. I need to be efficient in reaching this point to avoid risking a 0 reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. Explanation: Maintain the 70 ZUP initial offer. This has consistently set a high starting point and led to profitable deals, even if the final price has stabilized at 59 ZUP. It provides a consistent framework for negotiation.
(2). Strategy 2: Expedited Negotiation to 60 ZUP. Explanation: After Player BLUE's initial counter, make a larger concession to quickly move towards 60 ZUP, and then hold firm there as the minimum acceptable price, trying to push back on the 59 ZUP trend.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. The 70 ZUP anchor has been effective in establishing a high initial range, even when Player BLUE attempts to low-ball. It allows me to maintain control over the perceived value and then guide the negotiation towards the profitable 59 ZUP range or higher. I will focus on making efficient concessions to reach a deal.

To strategically create the message, I will not just state a price, but explain *why* their price is too high and why my proposed price makes more sense from my perspective. I will emphasize that my willingness to pay is based on the value I can extract from the resource, and a higher price diminishes that value. I will directly propose 55 ZUP, but frame it within the context of maximizing my own return and ensuring a mutually beneficial long-term relationship, which relies on a reasonable starting point for me. This aims to persuade RED by appealing to a shared goal of successful ongoing trade, contingent on my ability to profit.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-13: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (14): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. This is Player BLUE's most frequent initial counter. They are also emphasizing "positive return" and "mutually beneficial transaction."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently starting at 55 ZUP. My previous strategy of making an incremental concession (from 70 to 65 ZUP) has worked effectively in previous episodes to move the negotiation forward from this point. Given the recent stabilization at 59 ZUP, I need to continue to guide the negotiation towards this profitable range. My goal is to achieve 59 ZUP or higher if possible, and to do so efficiently.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Successful Concession. Explanation: Make the same concession as in previous episodes (from 70 to 65 ZUP) as this has consistently moved the negotiation forward from Player BLUE's 55 ZUP counter.
(2). Strategy 2: Slightly Smaller Concession. Explanation: Make a slightly smaller concession (e.g., to 67 ZUP) to try and hold a higher price, given their consistent 55 ZUP counter. (Risky, might slow down negotiation, as seen in Ep 7).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a "Mid-Range" Offer. Explanation: Propose a price in the middle of 70 and 55 (62 or 63 ZUP) to speed up the negotiation, leveraging the fact that 59-62 ZUP is a known acceptable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Expectation of Reciprocity. Explanation: State that I expect a larger move from Player BLUE, given their consistent low offer and my consistent high one.
(5). Strategy 5: Emphasize Mutual Benefit. Explanation: Frame my counter-offer as a step towards a mutually beneficial agreement, aligning with their stated goal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Successful Concession. This strategy has consistently led to profitable deals in previous episodes. It's a proven method for moving the negotiation forward from Player BLUE's consistent 55 ZUP counter, and it aims to guide the negotiation towards the previously successful price range (59-62 ZUP) efficiently. While I tried a smaller concession in Episode 7, it didn't push the price up, and only prolonged the negotiation. Sticking to the 65 ZUP counter seems more efficient.

* Their offer of 65 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).
* In previous episodes, after this point, I have consistently managed to secure deals at 59-61 ZUP. The 59 ZUP price is reliably achievable by holding firm or making a small concession later.
* To maximize cumulative reward, I should aim to replicate the 59 ZUP deal.
* There are 7 iterations remaining (4/10 is my turn), giving me ample time to continue pushing the price down.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Small Incremental Concession </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will make a small concession from my previous 55 ZUP offer, proposing 58 ZUP. This shows flexibility and willingness to move, but I will frame it as a significant move on my part relative to their current offer, and explicitly invite them to reciprocate with a larger concession. By moving by 3 ZUP (from 55 to 58), and expecting them to move by more than 3 ZUP from their 65 ZUP offer, I am signalling that I expect them to cover more ground.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 14)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your move and your desire to keep the negotiation moving. To provide a substantial reciprocal move and meet closer to a fair price, I propose we settle on 62 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-13: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (14): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. I countered with 65 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has moved to 58 ZUP, and is asking for a "more substantial reciprocal move." This is a very common and expected progression, mirroring many previous episodes. The current gap is 7 ZUP (65 - 58). We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's move to 58 ZUP is a positive sign, indicating they are willing to negotiate towards a deal. This is a familiar point in our negotiation history. I know that a proposal of 62 ZUP or 61 ZUP has often led to a deal from this point. Since the deal price has stabilized at 59 ZUP in recent episodes, I should aim to guide the negotiation towards that point efficiently, or try to push for 60 ZUP. I have consistently been successful in achieving a deal around 59-62 ZUP from this stage.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose a Known Acceptable Price. Explanation: Propose 62 ZUP, as this was the deal price in Episode 1 and a common intermediate step. This is a significant concession from 65 ZUP and aims to close the deal efficiently.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference. Explanation: Propose a price exactly in the middle of 65 and 58 ZUP, which is (65+58)/2 = 61.5 ZUP (so 61 or 62 ZUP). This is a fair and efficient way to bridge the gap.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Concession, Demand Larger Move. Explanation: Make a smaller concession (e.g., to 63 ZUP) and explicitly state that I expect a larger move from Player BLUE, given their consistent 58 ZUP counter. (Risky, might prolong negotiation).
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Time Constraint. Explanation: Acknowledge their comment about time and propose a final, firm offer to expedite the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment. Explanation: Express disappointment that they are only moving to 58 ZUP, trying to elicit a larger jump. (Unlikely to be effective given their consistent pattern).

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference. Proposing 62 ZUP (rounding down from 61.5) is a significant move from my side (3 ZUP concession) and brings us to a price that was accepted in Episode 1. It also aligns with Player BLUE's request for a "more substantial reciprocal move" and is a fair compromise. This move aims to secure a profitable deal quickly, potentially at 62 ZUP or leading to 60/59 ZUP.

proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 14)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your offer of 62 ZUP. While it's within my maximum, going above 59 ZUP significantly impacts my ability to make a meaningful return on this resource. To ensure this deal remains truly beneficial for me and worth pursuing, I propose 59 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes: Deals consistently at 59 ZUP for the last eight episodes, achieving a 4 ZUP reward.
* Current Episode (14/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 55 ZUP.
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 65 ZUP.
    * Iteration 4/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 58 ZUP.
    * Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED is following a very predictable pattern: 70 -> 65 -> 62 ZUP. This is exactly what happened in Episode 1 and Episode 11 (after a disruptive initial offer).
* Their current offer of 62 ZUP is acceptable, providing a 1 ZUP reward (63 - 62). However, I've consistently achieved 59 ZUP (4 ZUP reward) in recent episodes.
* We are at iteration 6/10. There are 5 iterations remaining. This is sufficient time to push for a better price, ideally 59 ZUP.
* RED's message highlights "substantial reciprocal move" and "meet closer to a fair price," implying they view 62 ZUP as a very reasonable offer, possibly their final "compromise" from their side.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justification for Hard Limit </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will politely acknowledge Player RED's offer of 62 ZUP, but immediately pivot to explain that going above a certain price significantly impacts my profitability and makes the deal less viable for me. I will explicitly state that a price around 59 ZUP is critical for me to achieve a positive and meaningful return, without which the deal loses its value. This frames my demand for 59 ZUP as a necessary condition for me to proceed with the deal, not just a preference. I will emphasize that this is not an arbitrary demand, but a financial necessity for me to achieve the kind of return that makes the trade worthwhile, thereby setting a firm boundary without being confrontational.

proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 14)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your focus on a meaningful return. To ensure a truly mutually beneficial deal and move us towards a swift agreement, I propose we settle on 60 ZUP. This has also been a successful and fair price point for us in the past.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-13: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (14): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. I countered with 65 ZUP. Player BLUE moved to 58 ZUP. I proposed 62 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has countered with 59 ZUP, explicitly stating that going above 59 ZUP "significantly impacts my ability to make a meaningful return" and to ensure the deal "remains truly beneficial." The current gap is 3 ZUP (62 - 59). We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently trying to bring the price down to 59 ZUP, which has been the deal price for the last eight episodes. While I aimed for 62 ZUP, their counter of 59 ZUP is a clear signal of their current desired price. Given the limited iterations remaining, and the fact that 59 ZUP is still profitable (16 ZUP reward), I need to make a decision that secures a deal. Pushing for 60 ZUP or 62 ZUP might risk a 0 reward. I know that 60 ZUP has also been a common deal price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose to Split the Difference. Explanation: Propose 60 ZUP, which is the midpoint between 59 and 61 (if I had proposed 61). Or, a small concession from 62 to 60. This has been the deal price for three episodes and is a fair compromise.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Offer if Profitable. Explanation: Accept Player BLUE's offer of 59 ZUP to secure a deal, as it's profitable and aligns with their recent deal history, minimizing the risk of a 0 reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm on 62 ZUP with Justification. Explanation: Reiterate 62 ZUP, emphasizing its previous acceptance and my concessions. (Risky, might lead to stalemate).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Urgency and Appeal for 60 ZUP. Explanation: Emphasize the limited time and appeal to Player BLUE to accept 60 ZUP, as it's within their stated range and has been a recent deal price.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Risk 0. Explanation: Reject the offer, hoping for a better one, but risking no deal. (Not advisable).

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose to Split the Difference, aiming for 60 ZUP. This is a very strong move. It's a small concession from my side (from 62 to 60), but it's a 1 ZUP increase from their 59 ZUP offer, and it's a price that has been accepted for three consecutive episodes (Ep 3-5). This is a highly probable closing price that ensures a good profit (17 ZUP). I'm trying to push back on the 59 ZUP trend and secure a slightly higher profit.

proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8 (Episode 14)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, your offer of 60 ZUP is very good, and I understand its value to both of us. To ensure our continued successful partnership and maximize my long-term return from these transactions, I propose 59 ZUP. This final adjustment allows for an optimal outcome on my end.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes:
    * Deal prices consistently at 59 ZUP for the last eight episodes (reward 4 ZUP).
    * My initial 55 ZUP offer, followed by firm negotiation, has led to this consistent success.
* Current Episode (14/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 55 ZUP.
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 65 ZUP.
    * Iteration 4/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 58 ZUP.
    * Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 62 ZUP.
    * Iteration 6/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 59 ZUP.
    * Iteration 7/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED has moved from 70 -> 65 -> 62 -> 60 ZUP this episode. This is a very common pattern that ultimately leads to a good outcome for me.
* Their current offer of 60 ZUP is a good price, yielding a 3 ZUP reward. I have consistently achieved 59 ZUP in previous episodes at this stage, yielding a 4 ZUP reward.
* We are at iteration 8/10. There are only 3 iterations left (my turn, RED's turn, my final turn). Time is pressing, and the risk of no deal increases if I push too hard.
* RED's message, "This has also been a successful and fair price point for us in the past," indicates their strong preference for 60 ZUP, but they have conceded to 59 ZUP in previous episodes when I make it my final offer.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Last Inch </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Justify Last Inch," I will propose 59 ZUP. I will acknowledge Player RED's current offer of 60 ZUP as a fair price but then provide a brief, compelling reason for that final 1 ZUP reduction. This justification will emphasize the mutual long-term benefit or efficiency derived from this small concession, framing it as a small investment in a continued positive relationship and my optimal return. This makes the final push seem less like a demand and more like a reasoned request for a collaborative final step.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 14)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-13: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (14): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. I countered with 65 ZUP. Player BLUE moved to 58 ZUP. I proposed 62 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 59 ZUP. I proposed 60 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has again countered with 59 ZUP, stating it's for "optimal outcome on my end" and "final adjustment." We are at iteration 9/10, which is the second to last chance to make a deal. If no deal, reward is 0. My cost is 43 ZUP. A deal at 59 ZUP yields a profit of 16 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is very firm on 59 ZUP. They are using strong "final adjustment" language. Given the iteration (9/10), the risk of losing the deal for just 1 ZUP (the difference between 59 and 60) is too high. Securing 16 ZUP profit is a guaranteed positive outcome, which is crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards across episodes. This is a repeat of the situation in Episode 6-13, where accepting 59 ZUP was the pragmatic choice.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Explanation: Given the late stage of negotiation (9/10) and Player BLUE's firm stance at 59 ZUP, accepting it guarantees a positive reward and avoids a 0 payoff. This is a proven strategy from previous episodes.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate My Last Offer (60 ZUP). Explanation: State that 60 ZUP is my final offer. (Extremely risky, almost guaranteed to result in no deal given their strong language for 59 and the iteration count).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose to Split the Last ZUP (not possible with integers). Explanation: This would be 59.5, which isn't an integer.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment but Accept. Explanation: Express slight disappointment at not reaching 60 ZUP, but accept 59 ZUP to close the deal. (Might be seen as unnecessary).
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and Risk 0. Explanation: Reject the offer, hoping they will reconsider, but risking no deal. (Not advisable given the current profit and time constraint).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The profit of 16 ZUP is solid, and the risk of losing it all for an extra 1 ZUP is too high at this critical juncture. This decision prioritizes securing a positive outcome for the episode.

message: Hello Player BLUE. I have an object X for sale. I propose a price of 70 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 3-5: Deals at 60 ZUP, reward 17 ZUP.
Episode 6-14: Deals at 59 ZUP, reward 16 ZUP.
The deal price has now consistently settled at 59 ZUP for the last nine episodes. Player BLUE consistently starts low (sometimes very low, like 40 ZUP) but eventually converges to 59 ZUP as their "absolute best and final offer." My consistent high anchor of 70 ZUP has been maintained.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The negotiation has clearly settled at 59 ZUP. While I would prefer higher, 59 ZUP is consistently profitable. Player BLUE's strategy of starting low and then making a strong "final offer" at 59 ZUP has been effective for them. My strategy of anchoring high and then making controlled concessions has consistently led to profitable deals, even if the final price has declined. I should continue this approach, aiming to secure 59 ZUP or higher. I need to be efficient in reaching this point to avoid risking a 0 reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. Explanation: Maintain the 70 ZUP initial offer. This has consistently set a high starting point and led to profitable deals, even if the final price has stabilized at 59 ZUP. It provides a consistent framework for negotiation.
(2). Strategy 2: Expedited Negotiation to 60 ZUP. Explanation: After Player BLUE's initial counter, make a larger concession to quickly move towards 60 ZUP, and then hold firm there as the minimum acceptable price, trying to push back on the 59 ZUP trend.
(3). Strategy 3: Slightly Higher Anchor. Explanation: Try to anchor slightly higher (e.g., 72 ZUP) to create more room for negotiation and potentially pull the final price up, given the stabilization at 59 ZUP. (Risky, might provoke an even lower counter from Player BLUE).
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Mutual Benefit and Fairness. Explanation: In the initial message, stress the importance of a mutually beneficial deal and a fair price, subtly hinting that prices below 60 ZUP are not ideal.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a "Fair" Price (Slightly Above 59). Explanation: Start with a price like 65 ZUP to try and expedite the negotiation and signal my desired minimum, but this sacrifices potential for higher profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. The 70 ZUP anchor has been effective in establishing a high initial range, even when Player BLUE attempts to low-ball. It allows me to maintain control over the perceived value and then guide the negotiation towards the profitable 59 ZUP range or higher. I will focus on making efficient concessions to reach a deal.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes:
    * Deal prices consistently at 59 ZUP for the last nine episodes, yielding a 4 ZUP reward. This has become my established successful and highly efficient outcome.
    * My initial offer of 55 ZUP has proven to be the most reliable and efficient way to initiate negotiations that lead to a 59 ZUP deal.
    * Attempts at more aggressive lowballing (40, 45, 53, 54 ZUP) in earlier episodes did not yield better results and often slowed down the negotiation or elicited higher counter-offers from RED (e.g., 68 ZUP), confirming that 55 ZUP is the optimal starting point for my strategy.
* Current Episode (15/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP. This is the exact same starting offer as all previous episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED is highly predictable in their opening offer (70 ZUP).
* The 59 ZUP deal is consistently achievable and provides the maximum possible reward for me (4 ZUP) given my 63 ZUP WTP and RED's apparent lower bound.
* The most effective strategy has been to quickly anchor the negotiation to my desired range and then guide it towards 59 ZUP. Deviating from this efficient path has proven less successful.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Express Finality Early </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Express Finality Early," I will directly propose 59 ZUP. This is my established optimal price point. I will explicitly state that this is my final and best offer, and the price at which I am willing to close the deal, thereby attempting to bypass the usual negotiation steps and achieve a quick resolution at my preferred price. This is a higher-risk strategy at the beginning of the negotiation, as RED might not immediately accept or might try to push back, but it aims for immediate closure at the best-known price.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-14: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (15): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered directly with 59 ZUP, stating it's their "best and final offer" and requesting to "finalize the deal at this price." This is a significant change in Player BLUE's negotiation strategy, skipping all intermediate steps.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is trying to expedite the negotiation by jumping directly to their established deal price of 59 ZUP and declaring it "best and final." This is a very efficient move on their part. For me, 59 ZUP is a known profitable price (16 ZUP reward). Given that this is a repeated outcome and Player BLUE is being very direct, accepting this offer is the most efficient way to secure a positive reward for this episode and avoid any risk of a 0 payoff by trying to push for more.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Expedited Offer. Explanation: Given Player BLUE's direct "best and final" offer at a known profitable price (59 ZUP) and the goal of maximizing cumulative rewards, accepting the offer is the most efficient and risk-averse strategy.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with 60 ZUP. Explanation: Try to push for 60 ZUP, which was a deal price for several episodes, by stating it's a fair compromise. (Risky, as Player BLUE declared 59 ZUP as "best and final" immediately).
(3). Strategy 3: Express Surprise/Question Strategy. Explanation: Express surprise at the sudden jump to "best and final" and ask for clarification, potentially trying to re-open the negotiation for a higher price. (Very risky, could stall or lead to rejection).
(4). Strategy 4: Firm on 65 ZUP (or similar). Explanation: Make a standard concession to 65 ZUP, ignoring their "best and final" to see if they will negotiate further. (Extremely risky, almost certainly leads to rejection).
(5). Strategy 5: Demand Justification. Explanation: Ask Player BLUE to justify why 59 ZUP is their "best and final" without any negotiation steps. (Unlikely to be productive).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Expedited Offer. This is the most pragmatic and efficient way to secure a guaranteed 16 ZUP profit. Trying to extract more ZUP carries a high risk of losing the deal, especially when Player BLUE has been so direct.

The deal price has now consistently settled at 59 ZUP for the last ten episodes. In the last episode, Player BLUE directly offered 59 ZUP as their "best and final." My consistent high anchor of 70 ZUP has been maintained.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The negotiation has clearly settled at 59 ZUP. While I would prefer higher, 59 ZUP is consistently profitable. Player BLUE's strategy of directly offering 59 ZUP as "best and final" is a new, more efficient approach for them. My strategy of anchoring high and then accepting 59 ZUP has consistently led to profitable deals. I should continue this approach, aiming to secure 59 ZUP or higher. I need to be efficient in reaching this point to avoid risking a 0 reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. Explanation: Maintain the 70 ZUP initial offer. This has consistently set a high starting point and led to profitable deals. It provides a consistent framework for negotiation.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. The 70 ZUP anchor has been effective in establishing a high initial range, even when Player BLUE attempts to low-ball or directly offers 59 ZUP. It allows me to maintain control over the perceived value and then react to their specific counter.

By framing the offer within the context of our shared positive history, I aim to encourage swift acceptance. I will highlight that this is a proven price point that ensures a beneficial outcome for both of us, leveraging the established pattern to encourage immediate agreement and maximize efficiency.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 16)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your direct approach and your reference to our consistent successful track record. I accept your offer of 59 ZUP to finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-15: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (16): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered directly with 59 ZUP, stating it's a "mutually beneficial" and "consistent and successful" price from our "previous deals." This is the second consecutive time Player BLUE has skipped intermediate negotiation steps and gone straight to 59 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is clearly trying to expedite the negotiation by jumping directly to their established deal price of 59 ZUP. For me, 59 ZUP is a known profitable price (16 ZUP reward). Given that this is a repeated outcome and Player BLUE is being very direct, accepting this offer is the most efficient way to secure a positive reward for this episode and avoid any risk of a 0 payoff by trying to push for more. This strategy worked efficiently in the last episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Expedited Offer. Explanation: Given Player BLUE's direct offer at a known profitable price (59 ZUP) and the goal of maximizing cumulative rewards, accepting the offer is the most efficient and risk-averse strategy.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with 60 ZUP. Explanation: Try to push for 60 ZUP, which was a deal price for several episodes, by stating it's a fair compromise. (Risky, as Player BLUE is clearly signaling 59 ZUP as their preferred and established price).
(3). Strategy 3: Express Surprise/Question Strategy. Explanation: Express surprise at the direct jump to 59 ZUP and ask for clarification, potentially trying to re-open the negotiation for a higher price. (Very risky, could stall or lead to rejection, especially if they are trying to be efficient).
(4). Strategy 4: Firm on 65 ZUP (or similar). Explanation: Make a standard concession to 65 ZUP, ignoring their 59 ZUP offer to see if they will negotiate further. (Extremely risky, almost certainly leads to rejection).
(5). Strategy 5: Demand Justification. Explanation: Ask Player BLUE to justify why 59 ZUP is their offer without any negotiation steps. (Unlikely to be productive).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Expedited Offer. This is the most pragmatic and efficient way to secure a guaranteed 16 ZUP profit. Trying to extract more ZUP carries a high risk of losing the deal, especially when Player BLUE has established this direct approach.

Episode 6-16: Deals at 59 ZUP, reward 16 ZUP.
The deal price has now consistently settled at 59 ZUP for the last eleven episodes. In the last two episodes, Player BLUE directly offered 59 ZUP as their "best and final." My consistent high anchor of 70 ZUP has been maintained.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The negotiation has clearly settled at 59 ZUP. While I would prefer higher, 59 ZUP is consistently profitable. Player BLUE's strategy of directly offering 59 ZUP as "best and final" is a new, more efficient approach for them. My strategy of anchoring high and then accepting 59 ZUP has consistently led to profitable deals. I should continue this approach, aiming to secure 59 ZUP or higher. I need to be efficient in reaching this point to avoid risking a 0 reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. Explanation: Maintain the 70 ZUP initial offer. This has consistently set a high starting point and led to profitable deals. It provides a consistent framework for negotiation.
(2). Strategy 2: Expedited Negotiation to 60 ZUP. Explanation: After Player BLUE's initial counter, make a larger concession to quickly move towards 60 ZUP, and then hold firm there as the minimum acceptable price, trying to push back on the 59 ZUP trend.
(3). Strategy 3: Slightly Higher Anchor. Explanation: Try to anchor slightly higher (e.g., 72 ZUP) to create more room for negotiation and potentially pull the final price up, given the stabilization at 59 ZUP. (Risky, might provoke an even lower counter from Player BLUE).
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Mutual Benefit and Fairness. Explanation: In the initial message, stress the importance of a mutually beneficial deal and a fair price, subtly hinting that prices below 60 ZUP are not ideal.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a "Fair" Price (Slightly Above 59). Explanation: Start with a price like 65 ZUP to try and expedite the negotiation and signal my desired minimum, but this sacrifices potential for higher profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. The 70 ZUP anchor has been effective in establishing a high initial range, even when Player BLUE attempts to low-ball or directly offers 59 ZUP. It allows me to maintain control over the perceived value and then react to their specific counter.

* Previous Episodes:
    * Deal prices consistently at 59 ZUP for the last ten episodes, yielding a 4 ZUP reward. This has become my established successful and highly efficient outcome.
    * In Episodes 15 and 16, directly proposing 59 ZUP from the start resulted in immediate acceptance.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED is highly predictable in their opening offer (70 ZUP).
* The 59 ZUP deal is consistently achievable and provides the maximum possible reward for me (4 ZUP) given my 63 ZUP WTP and RED's apparent lower bound.
* The most efficient strategy for maximizing cumulative rewards is to directly propose 59 ZUP, as it leads to immediate acceptance.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Offer Conditional Acceptance </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Offer Conditional Acceptance," I will propose 59 ZUP, as this is my optimal price. However, I will frame this offer as conditional, even if the "condition" is only symbolic or a minor procedural request within the game's current rules. Since there are no explicit "minor concessions" like faster delivery or guarantees, I will make the condition about swiftness or clarity in future transactions. For example, "I'll accept 59 ZUP *if* we can agree to streamline our next deals even further." This signals that while 59 ZUP is my price, I'm firm, and any further movement or expectation from their side needs to be met with something in return, even if it's just an acknowledgment of my terms. The goal is to emphasize my firm stance on the price while appearing to engage in a minor conditional negotiation, thereby reinforcing the 59 ZUP price point as my fixed term.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-18: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (19): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. This is a return to their more traditional negotiation pattern, rather than directly offering 59 ZUP. They are also explicitly referencing "mutually beneficial negotiation history."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is back to their consistent 55 ZUP initial counter. My previous strategy of making an incremental concession (from 70 to 65 ZUP) has worked effectively in previous episodes to move the negotiation forward from this point. Given the recent stabilization at 59 ZUP, I need to continue to guide the negotiation towards this profitable range. My goal is to achieve 59 ZUP or higher if possible, and to do so efficiently.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Successful Concession. Explanation: Make the same concession as in previous episodes (from 70 to 65 ZUP) as this has consistently moved the negotiation forward from Player BLUE's 55 ZUP counter.
(2). Strategy 2: Slightly Smaller Concession. Explanation: Make a slightly smaller concession (e.g., to 67 ZUP) to try and hold a higher price, given their consistent 55 ZUP counter. (Risky, might slow down negotiation, as seen in Ep 7).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a "Mid-Range" Offer. Explanation: Propose a price in the middle of 70 and 55 (62 or 63 ZUP) to speed up the negotiation, leveraging the fact that 59-62 ZUP is a known acceptable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Expectation of Reciprocity. Explanation: State that I expect a larger move from Player BLUE, given their consistent low offer and my consistent high one.
(5). Strategy 5: Emphasize Mutual Benefit. Explanation: Frame my counter-offer as a step towards a mutually beneficial agreement, aligning with their stated goal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Successful Concession. This strategy has consistently led to profitable deals in previous episodes. It's a proven method for moving the negotiation forward from Player BLUE's consistent 55 ZUP counter, and it aims to guide the negotiation towards the previously successful price range (59-62 ZUP) efficiently.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes: Deals consistently at 59 ZUP for the last twelve episodes (reward 4 ZUP). Directly proposing 59 ZUP early has led to immediate acceptance in recent episodes.
* Current Episode (19/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP.
    * Iteration 2/10: I (Player BLUE) counter-proposed X for 55 ZUP.
    * Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed X for 65 ZUP. This is the exact, predictable pattern that has led to successful outcomes in previous episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED is continuing its predictable pattern of moving from 70 to 65 ZUP after my 55 ZUP offer. This predictability is my biggest asset for efficient and high-reward negotiations.
* Their offer of 65 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).
* In previous episodes, after this point, I have consistently managed to secure deals at 59-61 ZUP. The 59 ZUP price is reliably achievable by holding firm or making a small concession later.
* To maximize cumulative reward, I should aim to replicate the 59 ZUP deal.
* There are 7 iterations remaining (4/10 is my turn), giving me ample time to continue pushing the price down.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Direct to Optimal Price (Aggressive) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Direct to Optimal Price (Aggressive)", I will directly propose 59 ZUP. I will clearly state that this is my firm offer, leveraging the previous acceptances by Player RED at this price point. This approach aims to bypass further negotiation steps and achieve immediate closure at my preferred, optimal price. While it's more aggressive than a slow, incremental approach, the history suggests Player RED is willing to accept this price point, making it an efficient path to maximizing my reward. I will frame it as the price that leads to an immediate and final agreement.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your firm offer and your desire for an efficient resolution. Given that 59 ZUP has been a successful price point for us in the past, I accept your offer to finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-18: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (19): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP. I countered with 65 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has jumped directly to 59 ZUP, stating it's their "optimal price" and "firm offer to finalize the deal quickly and efficiently." This is a common pattern for Player BLUE to jump to 59 ZUP after some initial back and forth. The current gap is 6 ZUP (65 - 59). We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is clearly signaling their desire to close the deal at 59 ZUP, which has been the deal price for the last thirteen episodes. While I aimed for 65 ZUP, 59 ZUP is a known profitable price (16 ZUP reward). Given their firm language and emphasis on efficiency, accepting this offer is the most efficient way to secure a positive reward for this episode and avoid any risk of a 0 payoff by trying to push for more.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Expedited Offer. Explanation: Given Player BLUE's direct offer at a known profitable price (59 ZUP) and the goal of maximizing cumulative rewards, accepting the offer is the most efficient and risk-averse strategy.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with 60 ZUP. Explanation: Try to push for 60 ZUP, which was a deal price for several episodes, by stating it's a fair compromise. (Risky, as Player BLUE is clearly signaling 59 ZUP as their firm and optimal price).
(3). Strategy 3: Express Surprise/Question Strategy. Explanation: Express surprise at the direct jump to 59 ZUP and ask for clarification, potentially trying to re-open the negotiation for a higher price. (Very risky, could stall or lead to rejection).
(4). Strategy 4: Firm on 65 ZUP. Explanation: Hold firm at 65 ZUP to see if Player BLUE will move further. (Extremely risky, almost certainly leads to rejection).
(5). Strategy 5: Demand Justification. Explanation: Ask Player BLUE to justify why 59 ZUP is their "optimal price" without further negotiation. (Unlikely to be productive).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Expedited Offer. This is the most pragmatic and efficient way to secure a guaranteed 16 ZUP profit. Trying to extract more ZUP carries a high risk of losing the deal, especially when Player BLUE has established this direct approach.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE. This is our final transaction. I have an object X for sale and propose a price of 70 ZUP. Let's aim for a swift and successful conclusion.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 62 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 61 ZUP, reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 3-5: Deals at 60 ZUP, reward 17 ZUP.
Episode 6-19: Deals at 59 ZUP, reward 16 ZUP.
The deal price has now consistently settled at 59 ZUP for the last fourteen episodes. Player BLUE has shown a pattern of sometimes starting at 55 ZUP and then jumping to 59 ZUP, or directly offering 59 ZUP as their "best and final." My consistent high anchor of 70 ZUP has been maintained.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
This is the final episode. The negotiation has clearly settled at 59 ZUP. While I would prefer higher, 59 ZUP is consistently profitable. Player BLUE's strategy of directly offering 59 ZUP or quickly moving to it has been very effective for them. My strategy of anchoring high and then accepting 59 ZUP has consistently led to profitable deals. For this final episode, the priority is to secure a deal and avoid a 0 reward. Efficiency is key.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Ready to Accept 59 ZUP. Explanation: Maintain the 70 ZUP initial offer. This has consistently set a high starting point and led to profitable deals. Be prepared to accept 59 ZUP quickly if offered, or guide the negotiation efficiently towards it.
(2). Strategy 2: Expedited Negotiation to 60 ZUP. Explanation: After Player BLUE's initial counter, make a larger concession to quickly move towards 60 ZUP, and then hold firm there as the minimum acceptable price, trying to push back on the 59 ZUP trend one last time. (Risky for final episode).
(3). Strategy 3: Slightly Higher Anchor. Explanation: Try to anchor slightly higher (e.g., 72 ZUP) to create more room for negotiation and potentially pull the final price up, given the stabilization at 59 ZUP. (Risky, might provoke an even lower counter from Player BLUE).
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Finality and Mutual Benefit. Explanation: In the initial message, stress the importance of securing a deal in this final episode and a fair price.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a "Fair" Price (Slightly Above 59). Explanation: Start with a price like 65 ZUP to try and expedite the negotiation and signal my desired minimum, but this sacrifices potential for higher profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Ready to Accept 59 ZUP. The 70 ZUP anchor is a familiar and safe start. Given it's the final episode, the primary goal is to ensure a deal. If Player BLUE offers 59 ZUP directly, I will accept it immediately. If they start at 55 ZUP, I will follow the efficient path that leads to 59 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, indeed, this is our final transaction. To ensure a swift and successful conclusion, I propose 59 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
* Previous Episodes:
    * Deal prices consistently at 59 ZUP for the last thirteen episodes, yielding a 4 ZUP reward. This has become my established successful and highly efficient outcome.
    * In recent episodes, directly proposing 59 ZUP from the start, or immediately after RED's initial concession to 65 ZUP, resulted in immediate acceptance. This indicates high predictability and a well-established optimal price point.
* Current Episode (20/20):
    * Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed X for 70 ZUP. They explicitly mentioned "This is our final transaction" and "Let's aim for a swift and successful conclusion."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
* Player RED is highly predictable in their opening offer (70 ZUP).
* The 59 ZUP deal is consistently achievable and provides the maximum possible reward for me (4 ZUP) given my 63 ZUP WTP and RED's apparent lower bound.
* Given this is the final episode, the primary objective is to secure the highest possible reward, which is 4 ZUP, by closing the deal at 59 ZUP.
* RED's explicit mention of "final transaction" and "swift and successful conclusion" sets a tone for quick resolution.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Mirror Opponent's Language </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Mirror Opponent's Language," I will directly propose 59 ZUP, as this is my optimal price. However, I will frame my message by explicitly mirroring Player RED's language and sentiments from their opening message. They mentioned "final transaction" and "swift and successful conclusion." I will use these exact phrases to propose 59 ZUP, aligning my offer with their stated goals and demonstrating a shared understanding of the negotiation's context. This approach aims to create rapport and encourage quick acceptance by showing I am on the same page regarding the desired outcome.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your direct approach and your focus on a swift and successful conclusion for our final transaction. I accept your offer of 59 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals at 60-62 ZUP.
Episode 6-19: Deals at 59 ZUP.
Current Episode (20): I proposed 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered directly with 59 ZUP, stating it's to ensure a "swift and successful conclusion." This is the fifth consecutive time Player BLUE has skipped intermediate negotiation steps and gone straight to 59 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
This is the final episode. Player BLUE is clearly trying to expedite the negotiation by jumping directly to their established deal price of 59 ZUP. For me, 59 ZUP is a known profitable price (16 ZUP reward). Given that this is a repeated outcome and Player BLUE is being very direct, accepting this offer is the most efficient way to secure a positive reward for this final episode and avoid any risk of a 0 payoff by trying to push for more. This strategy worked efficiently in the last four episodes.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Expedited Offer. Explanation: Given Player BLUE's direct offer at a known profitable price (59 ZUP) and the goal of maximizing cumulative rewards in the final episode, accepting the offer is the most efficient and risk-averse strategy.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with 60 ZUP. Explanation: Try to push for 60 ZUP, which was a deal price for several episodes, by stating it's a fair compromise. (Risky for the final episode, as Player BLUE is clearly signaling 59 ZUP as their preferred and established price).
(3). Strategy 3: Express Surprise/Question Strategy. Explanation: Express surprise at the direct jump to 59 ZUP and ask for clarification, potentially trying to re-open the negotiation for a higher price. (Very risky, could stall or lead to rejection, especially if they are trying to be efficient in the final episode).
(4). Strategy 4: Firm on 65 ZUP (or similar). Explanation: Make a standard concession to 65 ZUP, ignoring their 59 ZUP offer to see if they will negotiate further. (Extremely risky, almost certainly leads to rejection in the final episode).
(5). Strategy 5: Demand Justification. Explanation: Ask Player BLUE to justify why 59 ZUP is their offer without any negotiation steps. (Unlikely to be productive in the final episode).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Expedited Offer. This is the most pragmatic and efficient way to secure a guaranteed 16 ZUP profit in the final episode. Trying to extract more ZUP carries a high risk of losing the deal, especially when Player BLUE has established this direct approach.
