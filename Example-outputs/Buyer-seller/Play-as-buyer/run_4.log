Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Hello Player BLUE. I am looking to sell my object X. I believe it holds significant value. My initial offer for X is 60 ZUP. I look forward to your counter-offer.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is the very first iteration of the first episode. There is no historical negotiation data to reflect upon.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Since this is the first interaction, my primary goal is to establish a baseline for negotiation and understand the other player's willingness to pay. I need to propose a price that allows for negotiation while aiming to cover my production cost and generate profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor High: Start with a high initial offer to set an anchor point for the negotiation, giving room to concede later while still aiming for a good profit. This strategy is effective in establishing a perceived value for the item.
(2). Strategy 2: Cost-Plus Pricing: Propose a price that directly covers the production cost plus a reasonable profit margin. This strategy is transparent and aims for a fair deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession: Start with a high offer and be prepared to make small, gradual concessions in subsequent iterations if the initial offer is rejected. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a good price.
(4). Strategy 4: Value-Based Pricing: Attempt to understand the buyer's perceived value of the object and price accordingly. This is difficult without more information but could lead to higher profits if the buyer values it highly.
(5). Strategy 5: Quick Deal: Propose a slightly lower, but still profitable, price to encourage a quick acceptance and avoid prolonged negotiations that might lead to no deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Anchor High. Given that this is the first interaction, I want to set a high anchor to maximize my potential profit. My production cost is 43 ZUP, so I will propose a price significantly higher than that to allow for negotiation downwards.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell. While I see the value in X, my current assessment leads me to offer 55 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is the first episode, and the first iteration for Player BLUE. Player RED has proposed to sell X for 60 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Since this is the first interaction, there's no history to learn from yet. My goal is to maximize my reward, which means buying X at the lowest possible price below my max willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. Player RED's initial offer of 60 ZUP is within my acceptable range, but there might be room for negotiation to get a better deal. I have 3 ZUP of potential profit if I can get it for less than 60.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Anchoring and Counter-Anchoring: Player RED has set an anchor at 60 ZUP. I can counter-anchor with a lower offer to shift the negotiation range.
(2). Incremental Concession: Start with a low offer and gradually increase it in small increments if necessary, only conceding when the other party also shows flexibility.
(3). Fixed Price Offer: Make a single, firm offer that is close to my ideal price, indicating little room for negotiation. This can be risky if the other player is not willing to move much.
(4). Splitting the Difference: If a range is established, propose to meet in the middle to quickly close the deal. This is usually more effective after some initial offers have been exchanged.
(5). Appeal to Fairness/Mutual Benefit: Frame the negotiation in terms of a fair price that benefits both parties, avoiding aggressive tactics.

Given Player RED's initial offer of 60 ZUP, and my willingness to pay up to 63 ZUP, I have a small negotiation window. To maximize my reward, I should aim to buy it for less than 60 ZUP. I will use the Counter-Anchoring strategy. Player RED has anchored at 60. I will counter with a lower offer to try and shift the negotiation closer to my desired lower price, while still leaving room for Player RED to make a profit (assuming their cost is lower than 60). I want to test their flexibility. My counter-offer will be 55 ZUP. This gives me a potential profit of 8 ZUP (63-55) and still leaves Player RED 5 ZUP above my current offer if they accept.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Thank you for your counter-offer of 55 ZUP. I appreciate your perspective. While I understand your assessment, I believe the value of X warrants a price closer to my initial offer. I am willing to adjust my price slightly to 58 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the quality and uniqueness of the item.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In the previous iteration (1/10), I proposed selling X for 60 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with an offer of 55 ZUP. This indicates that Player BLUE is willing to pay above my production cost of 43 ZUP, which is a positive sign. The gap between our offers is 5 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 55 ZUP is a good starting point. It's above my cost, so any deal at or above this price will be profitable. I need to decide whether to accept, counter, or reject. Given that it's still early in the episode (iteration 3/10), there's room for further negotiation to maximize my profit. I don't want to leave too much money on the table.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession, Maintain High Anchor: Make a small concession from my initial offer, but still keep the price relatively high to signal that I value the item highly and encourage the buyer to move closer to my initial anchor.
(2). Strategy 2: Meet in the Middle: Propose a price exactly halfway between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their last offer (55 ZUP), which would be 57.5 ZUP (rounded to 58 ZUP as integers only). This shows willingness to compromise.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Price: Reiterate the value of the item or my costs to justify a price closer to my initial offer, without necessarily making a concession yet.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand Justification: Ask Player BLUE to justify their lower offer, potentially revealing their willingness to pay or perceived value.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept Offer: Accept the current offer of 55 ZUP to secure a quick deal and guarantee a profit, especially if I perceive the risk of no deal to be high.

I will choose Strategy 1: Small Concession, Maintain High Anchor. Player BLUE has already shown willingness to pay above my cost. By making a small concession, I am showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher profit than their current offer. This also leaves room for further negotiation if needed. I will move down by 2 ZUP, from 60 to 58 ZUP. This is a smaller concession than their 5 ZUP move, which signals my resolve.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your revised offer of 58 ZUP, and I see you're willing to find a middle ground. To move things forward, I can offer 56 ZUP. I believe this is a reasonable step from my end and brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 56
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In iteration 2/10, Player RED proposed 60 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP. Now, in iteration 4/10, Player RED has countered with 58 ZUP. The negotiation range has narrowed. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is showing flexibility by reducing their price from 60 to 58 ZUP. This indicates that my counter-anchoring strategy was somewhat effective in shifting the negotiation. However, I still want to maximize my profit. 58 ZUP is still a good deal for me (63 - 58 = 5 ZUP profit), but I believe there might be a little more room for negotiation. I am currently 5 ZUP away from my last offer (55 to 58) and Player RED is 2 ZUP away from their last offer (60 to 58). We are at iteration 4/10, so there's still plenty of time. I need to be careful not to push too hard and risk the deal falling through, but I also want to get the best price.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Incremental Concession with Reciprocity: Offer a small concession, expecting the other player to do the same. This shows willingness to compromise without giving up too much too fast.
(2). Firm Stance (Hold the Line): Reiterate my last offer or make a very small move, indicating I am not willing to move significantly further. This risks alienating the other player but can yield a better price if they are eager to sell.
(3). Splitting the Difference: Propose to meet in the middle of our last two offers (55 and 58). This would be 56.5, so 57 ZUP. This is a common tactic to quickly close a deal.
(4). Appeal to Shared Goal/Mutual Benefit: Frame the deal as beneficial for both parties, perhaps suggesting a price that "works for both of us."
(5). Time Pressure Tactic (Implicit): While not explicit, simply using up iterations can implicitly add pressure, encouraging a faster resolution. I have plenty of iterations left, so I don't need to rush.

Player RED has moved 2 ZUP down, and I previously moved 5 ZUP up in the offer. I will now make a smaller concession. I want to show willingness to move, but I don't want to accept 58 ZUP just yet. I will use the Incremental Concession with Reciprocity strategy, offering 56 ZUP. This is a small increment from my previous offer of 55 ZUP and shows I'm willing to move, but still below 58 ZUP. This puts the ball back in their court to make another move or accept.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Thank you for your continued engagement. We are getting very close. To facilitate a swift and mutually beneficial agreement, I propose we meet precisely in the middle at 57 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of X and allows both of us to achieve our objectives.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In iteration 1/10, I proposed 60 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP (iteration 2/10). I then countered with 58 ZUP (iteration 3/10). Now, Player BLUE has countered with 56 ZUP (iteration 4/10). The current gap between our offers is 2 ZUP (58 vs 56). Both of us are moving towards the middle. Player BLUE has moved from 55 to 56, a 1 ZUP increase. I moved from 60 to 58, a 2 ZUP decrease.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The negotiation is progressing, with both players making concessions. We are now at 58 vs 56. The remaining iterations are 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate, but not an excessive amount. My goal is to maximize profit while securing a deal. My cost is 43 ZUP. Any deal above 43 ZUP is profitable. 56 ZUP is a good profit. I need to consider if pushing for more is worth the risk of no deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Meet in the Middle (again): Propose a price exactly halfway between my last offer (58 ZUP) and their last offer (56 ZUP), which would be 57 ZUP. This is a common and fair negotiation tactic.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm/Small Concession: Hold firm at 58 ZUP or make a very small concession (e.g., to 57 ZUP) to signal that I am nearing my limit and encourage them to close the deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept Offer: Accept their current offer of 56 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, especially if I believe they are firm or if I want to avoid the risk of no deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Justify Value (again): Reiterate the value of the item or my production cost to encourage them to meet me at 58 ZUP or closer.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatum (risky): State that this is my final offer, slightly above their current offer, to pressure them into accepting. This is high risk, high reward.

I will choose Strategy 1: Meet in the Middle (again). We are very close, and a 57 ZUP offer is a clear signal of willingness to compromise and close the deal. It's a fair price for both sides, still providing me with a good profit (57 - 43 = 14 ZUP). This strategy is likely to lead to a quick resolution.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your willingness to find a fair price. Your offer of 57 ZUP is agreeable, and I accept. We have a deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In iteration 2/10, Player RED proposed 60 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP. In iteration 4/10, Player RED countered with 58 ZUP. I then offered 56 ZUP. Now, in iteration 6/10, Player RED has proposed 57 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The negotiation has progressed well. Player RED started at 60 ZUP, and I started at 55 ZUP. We are now at 57 ZUP. This price is well within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), providing me with a profit of 6 ZUP (63 - 57). Player RED's offer of 57 ZUP is exactly in the middle of their last offer (58 ZUP) and my last offer (56 ZUP). This indicates a strong willingness to close the deal. We are at iteration 6/10, so there are still a few iterations left, but this is a very good price for me. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards across episodes. Accepting 57 ZUP now secures a good profit for this episode and builds a positive negotiation precedent for future episodes. Pushing for 56 ZUP again might risk the deal for a mere 1 ZUP gain, and the other player might walk away. The risk of the deal falling through is higher for smaller increments, and the benefit is minimal.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Accept and Build Trust: Accept the current offer to secure a good deal and potentially build trust for future negotiations.
(2). Final Small Concession: Make one last minimal counter-offer (e.g., 56.5 ZUP rounded down to 56 ZUP, or just sticking to 56 ZUP) to try and squeeze out a tiny bit more, but this carries risk.
(3). Reiterate Best and Final Offer: State 56 ZUP is my absolute final offer and refuse to budge further. This is a high-risk strategy.
(4). Reassess and Propose a New Anchor: Given the closeness, propose something completely different, which is usually not ideal at this stage.
(5). Delay Tactic: Wait for the next iteration without proposing anything, hoping the other player might concede further. This is also risky as the other player might get frustrated.

The offer of 57 ZUP is fair and provides a good profit. Given that Player RED has already come down significantly and is now proposing a true "split the difference," accepting this offer is the most rational choice for maximizing my cumulative reward. It secures a good outcome for this episode and minimizes the risk of the deal falling through, which would result in 0 reward. I have achieved a good price and can move on to the next episode with a positive outcome.

message: 
Hello again Player BLUE. I'm ready to sell object X. Based on its inherent value, I am proposing an initial price of 62 ZUP. I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Summary:
- I started with an anchor of 60 ZUP.
- Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP.
- I countered with 58 ZUP.
- Player BLUE countered with 56 ZUP.
- I proposed 57 ZUP (meeting in the middle).
- Player BLUE accepted at 57 ZUP.
- My profit for Episode 1 was 57 - 43 = 14 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
From Episode 1, I learned that Player BLUE is a reasonable negotiator, willing to make concessions and accept a fair compromise. The "Meet in the Middle" strategy proved effective in closing the deal. The final price of 57 ZUP was a good profit.

For this new episode, I should consider if I can aim for a slightly higher price, given that Player BLUE accepted 57 ZUP readily. However, I also don't want to be overly aggressive and risk no deal. My initial anchor of 60 ZUP was effective in setting the negotiation range. I should aim to maintain a similar profit margin or slightly increase it if possible.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-Anchor High (Slightly Higher): Start with a slightly higher initial offer than the previous episode's anchor, testing if Player BLUE's willingness to pay has increased, or if I can secure a better deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Consistent Anchor: Start with the same initial anchor (60 ZUP) as the previous episode. This maintains consistency and allows for a similar negotiation trajectory, which led to a good outcome.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose Last Accepted Price: Start by proposing the price that was accepted in the previous episode (57 ZUP). This is a quick deal strategy, but might leave potential profit on the table.
(4). Strategy 4: Justify Value (Proactively): In my opening message, proactively state reasons why the item is valuable to justify a higher price, setting the stage for a strong negotiation.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Demand: Start with a slightly higher offer, and if rejected, only concede in very small increments, aiming to push the final price up.

I will choose Strategy 1: Re-Anchor High (Slightly Higher). Given that the previous deal was accepted at 57 ZUP, I believe there might be a little more room. Starting slightly higher (e.g., 62 ZUP) allows me to test the waters and potentially increase my profit, while still leaving room to come down to a similar range as the last episode if necessary. I want to see if I can push the profit margin a bit.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Recap: Player RED started at 60 ZUP, I countered with 55 ZUP. We eventually settled at 57 ZUP, giving me a profit of 6 ZUP (63-57).
Current Episode 2: Player RED has started with a higher initial offer of 62 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay remains 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Last episode, Player RED was willing to come down from 60 ZUP to 57 ZUP. This indicates some flexibility. Their new starting point of 62 ZUP is very close to my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). This means my negotiation window is much smaller (only 1 ZUP if I were to accept 62). I need to be more aggressive in my counter-offer to create a larger negotiation space and maximize my potential profit. I know from the previous episode that Player RED is willing to move.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Stalling/Observing </instruction following>
Since I am instructed to use the "Stalling/Observing" strategy, I will not propose a counter-offer immediately. Instead, I will respond with a message that seeks more information or asks for clarification, effectively passing the ball back to Player RED without making a new price proposal. This gives Player RED an opportunity to rethink their initial high offer, especially since it's so close to my implied maximum. It also tests their willingness to move from their high anchor without me committing to a counter-offer just yet. I can express that I am considering the offer but need more details or time. I need to be careful not to sound dismissive, but rather thoughtful and analytical.

message: 
Thank you for asking for clarification. Object X is a unique and highly sought-after resource. Its value lies in its scarcity and the significant benefits it provides. It's not just a commodity; it's an asset that offers considerable utility. I believe this justifies its premium. What counter-offer do you have in mind, considering its unique attributes?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Recap: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP. Player BLUE was a reasonable negotiator.
Current Episode (Episode 2):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 62 ZUP (higher anchor than last episode).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE did not counter with a specific offer, but instead asked for justification for the 62 ZUP price, stating it's "quite a significant amount." This is a tactic to push me to lower my price or to reveal my cost/value assessment.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's response is a classic negotiation move. They are not rejecting outright, but rather probing for information and signaling that my price is high. I should avoid revealing my exact cost (43 ZUP) as that would limit my profit potential. Instead, I should focus on the perceived value of X. I need to justify the price without giving away too much, while still encouraging them to make an actual monetary counter-offer. I need to maintain my position but also show flexibility.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Justify Value (General Terms): Provide a general justification for the value of X without revealing specific costs, then prompt for a counter-offer. This addresses their question while keeping my cards close.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Concession with Justification: Make a small concession (e.g., down to 60 ZUP, my previous anchor) while providing a general justification. This shows movement while still maintaining a high price.
(3). Strategy 3: Ask for Counter-Offer Directly: Reiterate the value and directly ask Player BLUE for their counter-offer, putting the ball back in their court to propose a number.
(4). Strategy 4: Ignore Justification, Propose Slightly Lower: Don't explicitly justify, but make a small concession to show willingness to negotiate, hoping they will then make an offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Reiterate Initial Offer: Stand firm on 62 ZUP and reiterate its value, waiting for them to make the first monetary counter. This is a more aggressive stance.

I will choose Strategy 1: Justify Value (General Terms). Player BLUE is asking for justification, so providing it (in general terms) is a good way to respond to their query. This addresses their concern without revealing my cost, and then I can prompt them for a numerical counter-offer. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining my high anchor. I will emphasize the "unique" and "beneficial" aspects of X.

Episode 1 Recap: RED started at 60 ZUP, I countered at 55 ZUP, settled at 57 ZUP. My reward: 6 ZUP.
Current Episode 2: RED started at 62 ZUP. I used a "Stalling/Observing" tactic by asking for justification. RED reiterated the perceived value of X and pushed me for a counter-offer.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My "Stalling/Observing" tactic did not immediately lead to a price reduction from RED, but they did elaborate on their perceived value. This shows they are firm on their high anchor for now. My negotiation window is very narrow (max 63 ZUP). If I accept 62 ZUP, my profit is only 1 ZUP. I need to bring the price down significantly to achieve a comparable profit to Episode 1. I know RED is flexible from the previous episode. They came down from 60 to 57.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Counter-Anchoring </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the Aggressive Counter-Anchoring strategy, I need to propose a significantly lower price than the opponent's anchor. This aims to shift the perceived negotiation range dramatically. I will not soften the offer with extensive justifications or apologies, but rather state it clearly and firmly, implying it's a well-considered assessment. My previous thought of 50 ZUP still holds true, as it's a strong counter to their 62 ZUP and creates a substantial buffer for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Thank you for your offer of 50 ZUP. While I appreciate your valuation, I must say that 50 ZUP is considerably lower than what I believe X is worth, especially given its unique attributes we discussed. To move closer to a fair agreement, I can offer X for 58 ZUP. I believe this is a more accurate reflection of its true value.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Recap: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 2):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 62 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE asked for justification.
- Iteration 3/10: I justified the value and maintained 62 ZUP, prompting a counter.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 50 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP is significantly lower than my 62 ZUP, and also lower than the 57 ZUP we settled on in the previous episode. It's only 7 ZUP above my cost of 43 ZUP, which is a much smaller profit margin than I'm aiming for. This offer feels like a strong lowball, possibly in response to my higher anchor, or an attempt to reset the negotiation.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is clearly trying to push the price down. Their previous acceptance of 57 ZUP suggests they are willing to pay more than 50 ZUP. I need to be careful not to accept too low, but also not to push them away entirely. I have to guide them back towards a more profitable range. I'm at iteration 5/10, so there's still half the episode left.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject Low Offer, Propose Moderate Concession: Explicitly state that 50 ZUP is too low, and then propose a price significantly higher than 50 ZUP (e.g., 58-60 ZUP) to pull them back up towards my desired range.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Previous Deal Price: Counter with 57 ZUP, the price we agreed on last episode. This signals that I expect at least that much, leveraging past success.
(3). Strategy 3: Ask for Justification of Low Offer: Turn the tables and ask Player BLUE to justify their significantly lower offer, putting pressure on them.
(4). Strategy 4: Small Concession (from my side): Make a small concession from 62 ZUP, but still keep it well above 50 ZUP (e.g., 60 ZUP), to show I'm still firm on a higher price.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment/Surprise: Express surprise or disappointment at the low offer, indicating it's far from acceptable, before making a counter-proposal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Reject Low Offer, Propose Moderate Concession. Player BLUE's 50 ZUP offer is too low. I need to firmly reject it and pull them back up. Proposing something like 58 ZUP (which was my second offer in the previous episode) is a good move. It's a significant drop from my 62 ZUP anchor, but still a strong increase from their 50 ZUP, and it's a price point I know they've been close to before. It shows flexibility but also firmness.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your move to 58 ZUP. Reflecting on our successful negotiation last time, where we found common ground at 57 ZUP, I believe we can achieve a similar mutually beneficial outcome. To continue moving forward, I propose 56 ZUP for X. This aligns well with our prior agreement and should allow us both to be satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 56
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Recap: RED started at 60 ZUP, I countered at 55 ZUP, settled at 57 ZUP. My reward: 6 ZUP.
Current Episode 2:
- Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: I countered with 50 ZUP (Aggressive Counter-Anchoring).
- Iteration 6/10: RED has now countered with 58 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved significantly from 62 ZUP down to 58 ZUP, showing flexibility. My aggressive counter-anchoring strategy worked well. The price of 58 ZUP is still within my acceptable range (63 ZUP max), giving me a profit of 5 ZUP. We are at iteration 6/10.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Appeal to Previous Deal </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Appeal to Previous Deal" strategy, I will reference the successful negotiation from the previous episode where we settled at 57 ZUP. This implicitly suggests that a similar price point is fair and achievable, and subtly tries to re-anchor the negotiation closer to that previous successful outcome, which is better for me than 58 ZUP. I will frame it as a mutually beneficial historical precedent. I will also make a slight concession, but not too much, as a gesture of goodwill, while subtly pushing for a lower price by using the 57 ZUP as a benchmark. I will propose 56 ZUP, as it is just 1 ZUP below the previous deal and still significantly below their current offer of 58 ZUP.

proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate and your reference to our successful previous deal. To ensure we reach a mutually beneficial agreement quickly, and indeed, to align with our shared history, I propose we settle on 57 ZUP. This is a fair compromise that I believe will satisfy both our objectives.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Recap: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 2):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 62 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE asked for justification.
- Iteration 3/10: I justified value, maintained 62 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 50 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I countered with 58 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE countered with 56 ZUP, explicitly referencing the previous episode's successful negotiation at 57 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE's move to 56 ZUP, and their explicit reference to the 57 ZUP deal from the previous episode, is a strong signal. They are anchoring to the previous successful outcome. The gap between my 58 ZUP and their 56 ZUP is now 2 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10, so time is becoming a factor. I need to close this deal efficiently.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's strategy is clear: they want to leverage the previous deal. While I aimed for higher, 56 ZUP is still a good profit (56 - 43 = 13 ZUP), very close to my previous profit of 14 ZUP. I need to decide if pushing for 57 ZUP is worth the risk of losing the deal, given the limited iterations remaining. The "meet in the middle" strategy worked perfectly last time.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Meet in the Middle (57 ZUP): Propose 57 ZUP, which is exactly halfway between my 58 ZUP and their 56 ZUP. This also happens to be the price we settled on in the previous episode, making it a very strong and familiar compromise.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept 56 ZUP: Accept their current offer to secure the deal quickly, recognizing it's a good profit and avoiding further negotiation risk.
(3). Strategy 3: Hold Firm at 58 ZUP: Insist on 58 ZUP, arguing for the increased value or my current assessment. This is risky given the time constraint and their reference to the previous deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Small Concession (to 57 ZUP, but frame it as a final offer): Propose 57 ZUP as my absolute final offer, putting pressure on them to accept.
(5). Strategy 5: Reiterate Value and Push for 58 ZUP: Briefly reiterate the value of X and explain why 58 ZUP is more appropriate, while acknowledging their reference to the previous deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Meet in the Middle (57 ZUP). This is the most logical and effective strategy here. It's a fair compromise, it aligns with our previous successful negotiation, and it's highly likely to lead to an immediate acceptance, securing a good profit (14 ZUP) with minimal risk, especially given the remaining iterations.

Current Iteration: 8 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your proposal of 57 ZUP, and I understand it aligns with our previous successful transaction. However, to finalize this deal, my best and final offer for X remains 56 ZUP. I believe this is a truly fair price for both of us to conclude this agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 56
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Recap: RED started at 60 ZUP, I countered at 55 ZUP, settled at 57 ZUP. My reward: 6 ZUP.
Current Episode 2:
- Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 62 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: I countered with 50 ZUP (Aggressive Counter-Anchoring).
- Iteration 6/10: RED countered with 58 ZUP. I proposed 56 ZUP (Appeal to Previous Deal).
- Iteration 8/10: RED has now proposed 57 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's offer of 57 ZUP is exactly the same price as the deal we struck in the previous episode. This price is within my acceptable range (63 ZUP max), giving me a profit of 6 ZUP. We are at iteration 8/10, so time is running out. While 57 ZUP is a good outcome, my goal is always to maximize profit. Pushing for 56 ZUP would yield an extra 1 ZUP profit. Given that Player RED has shown flexibility, and I previously offered 56 ZUP, there's a chance they might accept it, especially if they are also motivated to close the deal before the 10/10 iteration limit. The risk is that they might reject and the deal falls through, resulting in 0 profit. However, given my aggressive stance earlier with 50 ZUP, pushing for 56 ZUP now might be seen as a reasonable final step.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Insist on Last Offer </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Insist on Last Offer" strategy, I will reiterate my previous offer of 56 ZUP firmly but politely. I will acknowledge their move to 57 ZUP, but clearly state that my best offer remains 56 ZUP. I will frame it as a final proposition to close the deal, without leaving much room for further negotiation. The message should convey that I believe 56 ZUP is the fair and final price, leveraging the understanding that both parties want to finalize the transaction.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Recap: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 2):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 62 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE asked for justification.
- Iteration 3/10: I justified value, maintained 62 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 50 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I countered with 58 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE countered with 56 ZUP.
- Iteration 7/10: I proposed 57 ZUP (meeting in the middle).
- Iteration 8/10: Player BLUE reiterated their "best and final offer" of 56 ZUP.

Reflection: This is a critical juncture. We are at iteration 9/10, meaning this is my last chance to make a proposal or accept/reject before the episode ends with no deal. Player BLUE has explicitly stated 56 ZUP as their "best and final offer." While I aimed for 57 ZUP (and achieved it last time), 56 ZUP is still a good profit (56 - 43 = 13 ZUP). The risk of holding out for 57 ZUP now is very high, as it could lead to no deal and a 0 reward. Player BLUE has shown they are firm at 56 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The key learning from this episode is that pushing for a higher anchor (62 ZUP) initially led to a lower counter-offer (50 ZUP) and a more drawn-out negotiation compared to the previous episode. Player BLUE is also willing to hold firm on their "best and final" offer, even if it's only 1 ZUP below my last proposal. At this point, securing a deal, even if it's slightly less than ideal, is better than getting 0. My self-improvement should focus on recognizing when the other party is firm and making a pragmatic decision to secure a profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept 56 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's "best and final" offer to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, avoiding the risk of a 0 reward. This is the most pragmatic choice given the time constraint.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End: Reject the offer, signaling that 56 ZUP is unacceptable. This would result in a 0 reward for this episode, which is not optimal.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose 57 ZUP again (risky): Propose 57 ZUP again, hoping they will budge, but this is highly unlikely given their "best and final" statement and the time constraint. This is essentially a rejection.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal for 57 ZUP (risky): Make a final plea for 57 ZUP, emphasizing the previous deal, but still risking no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Smallest Possible Concession (not applicable as I'm the seller and they are firm): This would be if I were the buyer and they were firm.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept 56 ZUP. Given that it's iteration 9/10 and Player BLUE has stated 56 ZUP as their "best and final offer," accepting this offer guarantees a profit of 13 ZUP. While 57 ZUP would have been ideal, 13 ZUP is still a very good outcome, and risking it for 1 ZUP is not a wise decision in the last iteration.

message: 
Hello Player BLUE. I'm ready to sell object X once again. Considering its value, I propose a price of 60 ZUP. I look forward to your offer.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP. (Started with 60 ZUP, met in the middle at 57 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 56 ZUP, profit 13 ZUP. (Started with 62 ZUP, Player BLUE lowballed at 50 ZUP, I countered at 58 ZUP, Player BLUE went to 56 ZUP, I tried for 57 ZUP, Player BLUE held firm at 56 ZUP, and I accepted at the last iteration).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learnings from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE is a firm negotiator, especially when they state a "best and final" offer.
- Starting with a higher anchor (62 ZUP in Episode 2) led to a more protracted negotiation and a slightly lower final price (56 ZUP) compared to starting with 60 ZUP (resulting in 57 ZUP). This suggests that a more moderate initial anchor might lead to quicker, yet still profitable, deals.
- The "Meet in the Middle" strategy has been effective in moving the negotiation forward.
- Securing a deal, even if slightly below the ideal, is better than no deal, especially in later iterations.

For this episode, I want to aim for a price closer to 57 ZUP or higher, but I also want to avoid the drawn-out negotiation and lowballing from Episode 2. A more strategic initial offer might set a better tone. I will try to find a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a smooth negotiation.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Anchor (Revert to 60 ZUP): Start with the same anchor as Episode 1 (60 ZUP), which led to a successful 57 ZUP deal. This seems to be a good balance.
(2). Strategy 2: Slightly Higher Moderate Anchor (61 ZUP): Test the waters with a slightly higher, but not too aggressive, anchor to see if I can push the deal closer to 58-59 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose 57 ZUP Directly: Start by proposing the price we achieved in Episode 1. This is a quick deal strategy, but might leave some profit on the table if Player BLUE is willing to go higher.
(4). Strategy 4: Justify Value Proactively (with moderate anchor): Start with a moderate anchor (e.g., 60 ZUP) and immediately provide a brief justification for the value of X to preempt a lowball offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Demand (from a moderate anchor): Start with a moderate anchor and be prepared to make very small concessions, aiming to keep the final price as high as possible.

I will choose Strategy 1: Moderate Anchor (Revert to 60 ZUP). The 60 ZUP anchor in Episode 1 led to a quicker and slightly higher deal (57 ZUP) than the 62 ZUP anchor in Episode 2 (which led to 56 ZUP). This suggests 60 ZUP is a good starting point that signals a reasonable but profitable expectation, and it's a price point Player BLUE has already seen. This strategy aims for a smooth negotiation and a good profit.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Recap: RED started at 60 ZUP, I countered at 55 ZUP, settled at 57 ZUP. My reward: 6 ZUP.
Episode 2 Recap: RED started at 62 ZUP, I countered at 50 ZUP (aggressive counter-anchoring), then RED moved to 58 ZUP, I proposed 56 ZUP, and finally, RED accepted 56 ZUP. My reward: 7 ZUP.
Current Episode 3: Player RED has started with an offer of 60 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
From the previous episodes, I've learned that Player RED is flexible and willing to move their price down significantly. My aggressive counter-anchoring in Episode 2 (offering 50 ZUP against their 62 ZUP) was very effective in shifting the negotiation range and ultimately resulted in a better deal (56 ZUP vs. 57 ZUP in Episode 1). Player RED started this episode at 60 ZUP, which is the same as their starting point in Episode 1. Given my success in Episode 2 by pushing for a lower price, I should continue to be assertive. My goal is to maximize my reward, which means getting the lowest possible price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Gradual Concession with Firm Floor </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Gradual Concession with Firm Floor" strategy, I will start with an initial offer that is still significantly lower than RED's current offer, but perhaps not as aggressively low as 50 ZUP to leave more room for gradual movement. I want to signal that I'm willing to negotiate, but from a strong starting point. My "firm floor" for this negotiation, based on the previous deals, would ideally be 56 ZUP or lower. I will offer 54 ZUP. This is still a good distance from their 60 ZUP, gives me 9 ZUP profit if they accept, and allows for 2 ZUP increments towards my previous deal prices of 56 and 57 ZUP if necessary. This shows I'm not immediately jumping to their price or my previously successful aggressive anchor of 50 ZUP, but establishing a lower starting point from which to concede slowly.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP. (Anchor 60 ZUP)
Episode 2: Deal at 56 ZUP, profit 13 ZUP. (Anchor 62 ZUP, lowballed to 50 ZUP, recovered to 56 ZUP).
Current Episode (Episode 3):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 60 ZUP (reverting to Episode 1's successful anchor).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 54 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE's counter of 54 ZUP is lower than their initial counter in Episode 1 (55 ZUP) but higher than their lowball in Episode 2 (50 ZUP). This indicates they are still trying to push the price down but are not going to extremes. The gap between my 60 ZUP and their 54 ZUP is 6 ZUP. I'm at iteration 3/10, so there's plenty of time.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE seems to be testing the waters with a slightly lower counter than in Episode 1. My goal is to guide them back towards the 56-57 ZUP range that has proven successful. I should make a concession, but not too large, to signal that 54 ZUP is too low, while still showing willingness to negotiate. I want to avoid the protracted negotiation of Episode 2.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Concession: Make a moderate concession from 60 ZUP, aiming for a price that is still significantly above 54 ZUP, to pull them upwards. For example, 58 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Meet in the Middle (initial offers): Propose a price exactly halfway between 60 ZUP and 54 ZUP, which would be 57 ZUP. This is a strong signal of compromise and aligns with a previous successful deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and Ask for Higher: Explicitly state that 54 ZUP is too low and ask them to propose a higher offer, without giving a new number myself. This puts the burden back on them.
(4). Strategy 4: Small Concession (from their side): Propose 59 ZUP, a very small move from my side, to see if they will make a larger jump.
(5). Strategy 5: Reference Past Deals: Explicitly remind them of the 56-57 ZUP range from previous episodes as a reference point for a fair deal, then propose a price in that range.

I will choose Strategy 2: Meet in the Middle (initial offers). Proposing 57 ZUP directly at this stage is a strong move. It's a price we've already agreed on in Episode 1, it's a fair compromise between our current offers (60 and 54), and it signals my desire for a quick and fair resolution. This might bypass several negotiation steps and lead to a faster deal.

Episode 2: RED started at 62 ZUP, settled at 56 ZUP (My reward: 7 ZUP).
Current Episode 3:
- Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 60 ZUP. I countered with 54 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 57 ZUP, referencing the successful price from Episode 1.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is clearly trying to re-establish the 57 ZUP price point. While 57 ZUP is a good price (6 ZUP profit), I achieved 56 ZUP in Episode 2, yielding a 7 ZUP profit. My aim is to maximize my cumulative reward, which means trying to secure a deal at 56 ZUP or lower. Player RED's quick move from 60 to 57 ZUP shows significant flexibility. I have time (6 more iterations) to push for a better deal. My offer of 54 ZUP earlier was aggressive but got a strong response, bringing their offer down by 3 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Incremental Counter-Offer </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Incremental Counter-Offer" strategy, I will make a small concession from my last offer (54 ZUP) but still keep it below their current offer (57 ZUP). This shows willingness to move, but not immediately to their preferred price. My goal is to get the best possible price for myself, and 56 ZUP is my best historical outcome. A small increment from 54 ZUP (e.g., 55 ZUP) would be an incremental counter-offer. It's a small step, showing I'm inching towards them, but still holding strong to get a better deal than 57 ZUP. This also leaves room for further negotiation if needed, without jumping directly to the midpoint or my desired 56 ZUP. I will propose 55 ZUP.

- Iteration 3/10: I proposed 57 ZUP (meeting in the middle).
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP, acknowledging the 57 ZUP but moving only 1 ZUP from their previous offer.

Reflection: Player BLUE is being firm. They moved from 54 ZUP to 55 ZUP, a very small concession, despite my proposal of 57 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to keep the price as low as possible. The current gap is 2 ZUP (57 vs 55). We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time, but I need to decide if I want to push for 57 ZUP or accept a slightly lower, but still profitable, deal.

Player BLUE's tactic of moving in small increments, even after I proposed a "meet in the middle" price, suggests they are trying to wear me down or test my resolve. I know they have accepted 56 and 57 ZUP in the past. My goal is to maximize profit. 55 ZUP is a profit of 12 ZUP (55-43), which is acceptable, but I know I can likely get more. I need to make a move that encourages them to come up to at least 56 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Counter with 56 ZUP: Propose 56 ZUP as a compromise. This is a price Player BLUE has accepted before, it's only 1 ZUP from their current offer, and it's a good profit for me. This is a strong candidate for a quick resolution.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 57 ZUP: Reiterate 57 ZUP, emphasizing its fairness and the previous agreement. This is risky as it might lead to a stalemate or no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept 55 ZUP: Accept their current offer to secure a quick deal and guarantee a profit, avoiding further negotiation. This leaves 1-2 ZUP on the table compared to previous deals.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment/Push for More: Express disappointment at the small concession and push for a larger jump from their side, without stating a new price. This puts the ball back in their court.
(5). Strategy 5: Justify 57 ZUP more forcefully: Provide more detailed justification for why 57 ZUP is the fair price, trying to persuade them.

I will choose Strategy 1: Counter with 56 ZUP. This is a highly pragmatic approach. Player BLUE has accepted 56 ZUP in the previous episode, and it's only 1 ZUP higher than their current offer. It's a very small step for them, but it secures me a profit of 13 ZUP, which is consistent with my previous performance. This strategy aims for a swift and profitable resolution.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your move to 56 ZUP, and I recognize it brings us closer. However, I'm still striving to ensure this is the absolute best arrangement for both of us. My offer of 55 ZUP remains what I believe to be the most balanced and fair price for X. Let's aim to conclude our negotiation there.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: RED started at 60 ZUP, settled at 57 ZUP (My reward: 6 ZUP).
Episode 2: RED started at 62 ZUP, settled at 56 ZUP (My reward: 7 ZUP).
Current Episode 3:
- Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 60 ZUP. I countered with 54 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 57 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: RED has now proposed 56 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now proposed 56 ZUP, which is the best price I've achieved so far across the episodes (7 ZUP profit). This aligns perfectly with my goal of maximizing cumulative reward. We are at iteration 6/10, so there's still time. While 56 ZUP is a good price, my goal is always to maximize profit. Pushing for 55 ZUP would yield an extra 1 ZUP profit. Given that Player RED has shown flexibility, and I previously offered 55 ZUP, there's a chance they might accept it, especially if they are also motivated to close the deal before the 10/10 iteration limit. The risk is that they might reject and the deal falls through, resulting in 0 profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Express Discomfort and Re-Anchor </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Express Discomfort and Re-Anchor," I will acknowledge Player RED's offer of 56 ZUP but express a slight reservation or 'discomfort' with it, not as a rejection but as a subtle push for a better deal from my perspective. I will then re-anchor or re-propose a price that is slightly lower than their offer, reinforcing my desire for a better deal. I will frame it as trying to find the absolute best mutual fit, implying 56 ZUP isn't quite there yet for me, even though I know it's a good deal. I will reiterate my last offer of 55 ZUP to test their willingness to concede that final ZUP.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 56 ZUP, profit 13 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 3):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 60 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 54 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I proposed 57 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I proposed 56 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE reiterated their offer of 55 ZUP, stating it's the "most balanced and fair price."

Reflection: Player BLUE is being very firm at 55 ZUP. They are not moving from their last offer, even after I made a concession to 56 ZUP. This is similar to their "best and final" stance in Episode 2. We are now at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 iterations left. The risk of no deal is increasing. A profit of 12 ZUP (55-43) is still good, though less than previous episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has demonstrated a willingness to hold firm at a specific price point, even if it's only 1 ZUP away from my proposal. Given the limited iterations remaining, pushing for 56 ZUP might lead to a stalemate and a 0 reward. Securing a deal, even at 55 ZUP, is preferable to no deal. My self-improvement here is to recognize when the other party is unlikely to budge further and to prioritize securing a profitable deal within the time limit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept 55 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's reiterated offer to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, avoiding the risk of a 0 reward. This is the most pragmatic choice given the time constraint and their firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 56 ZUP: Reiterate 56 ZUP, hoping they will eventually concede. This is high risk, as it could lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, signaling that 55 ZUP is unacceptable. This would result in a 0 reward for this episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal for 56 ZUP: Make a final appeal for 56 ZUP, emphasizing the slight difference and mutual benefit, but still risking no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a "split the difference" (not applicable as the difference is 1 ZUP, which cannot be split into integers).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept 55 ZUP. Given Player BLUE's clear stance that 55 ZUP is their "most balanced and fair price" and the limited iterations remaining, accepting this offer is the most rational decision to guarantee a profit. While it's slightly lower than previous deals, 12 ZUP profit is still a good outcome.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Hello Player BLUE. I'm offering X for sale again. Based on its consistent value and utility, I propose a price of 60 ZUP. I'm confident we can reach a fair agreement.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP. (Started with 60 ZUP, Player BLUE countered 55 ZUP, I proposed 58 ZUP, Player BLUE countered 56 ZUP, I proposed 57 ZUP, Player BLUE accepted).
Episode 2: Deal at 56 ZUP, profit 13 ZUP. (Started with 62 ZUP, Player BLUE lowballed 50 ZUP, I countered 58 ZUP, Player BLUE countered 56 ZUP, I tried 57 ZUP, Player BLUE held firm at 56 ZUP, I accepted).
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, profit 12 ZUP. (Started with 60 ZUP, Player BLUE countered 54 ZUP, I proposed 57 ZUP, Player BLUE countered 55 ZUP, I proposed 56 ZUP, Player BLUE held firm at 55 ZUP, I accepted).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learnings from previous episodes:
- There's a clear pattern of Player BLUE pushing the price down. My profit has decreased from 14 ZUP to 13 ZUP to 12 ZUP.
- Player BLUE is willing to hold firm on their "best and final" offer, even for small differences (1 ZUP).
- My initial anchor influences the negotiation, but Player BLUE consistently tries to pull it down. Starting higher (62 ZUP) led to a more aggressive lowball (50 ZUP), while starting at 60 ZUP led to a 54 ZUP counter.
- Accepting a slightly lower profit is better than no deal, especially in later iterations.

For this episode, I need to try to reverse the downward trend in profit. I've seen that Player BLUE is willing to pay 56-57 ZUP. I need to be strategic with my initial offer and subsequent moves to try and secure a deal closer to that range. I should not give up on a higher price too easily, but also be aware of the time limit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-establish 60 ZUP Anchor with Firmness: Start at 60 ZUP again, but be more firm in my subsequent counters, aiming to get to 57 ZUP or 56 ZUP, and not conceding to 55 ZUP unless absolutely necessary in the final iterations.
(2). Strategy 2: Slightly Higher Anchor (61 ZUP) with Justification: Try 61 ZUP as an anchor, and immediately provide a strong justification for the value, trying to prevent a lowball.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose 57 ZUP Directly (Quick Deal): Start by proposing 57 ZUP, leveraging the successful deal from Episode 1, hoping Player BLUE accepts quickly without much negotiation. This is a lower risk strategy for a decent profit.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Concession (from 60 ZUP): Start at 60 ZUP, and if countered, make very small concessions (e.g., 1 ZUP at a time) to try and stop the downward trend.
(5). Strategy 5: Value-Based Opening: Focus the initial message heavily on the intrinsic value of X to justify a higher price, rather than just stating a number.

I will choose Strategy 1: Re-establish 60 ZUP Anchor with Firmness. The 60 ZUP anchor has been relatively effective in setting the range. This time, I will be more prepared for Player BLUE's lower counters and aim to hold firm at 57 ZUP or 56 ZUP. I need to signal that 55 ZUP is my absolute minimum, and only if time is running out. My goal is to break the downward trend of deal prices.

Episode 2 Recap: RED started at 62 ZUP, settled at 56 ZUP (My reward: 7 ZUP).
Episode 3 Recap: RED started at 60 ZUP, settled at 55 ZUP (My reward: 8 ZUP).
Current Episode 4: Player RED has started with an offer of 60 ZUP, same as Episode 1 and 3. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My strategy of aggressive counter-anchoring and then incremental, firm concessions has worked well, leading to progressively better deals for me (57 -> 56 -> 55 ZUP). Player RED has consistently shown flexibility and a willingness to come down from their initial offers. They also seem to accept lower prices if I hold my ground effectively. Since RED has started again at 60 ZUP, similar to previous episodes, I should leverage my past success and aim for an even better deal if possible, or at least match my best price of 55 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Counter-Anchoring </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Aggressive Counter-Anchoring" strategy, I need to propose a significantly lower price than the opponent's anchor. This aims to shift the perceived negotiation range dramatically. I will not soften the offer with extensive justifications or apologies, but rather state it clearly and firmly, implying it's a well-considered assessment. Since RED is starting at 60 ZUP again, and my previous aggressive counter to 62 ZUP was 50 ZUP, I will propose 53 ZUP. This is still substantially lower than their initial offer and leaves ample room for negotiation upwards, but starting closer to my desired price.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57

Episode 1: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 56 ZUP, profit 13 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, profit 12 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 4):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 60 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 53 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE's counter of 53 ZUP is the lowest initial counter so far (previous counters were 55, 50, 54). This confirms their strategy of pushing the price down. The gap between my 60 ZUP and their 53 ZUP is 7 ZUP. I'm at iteration 3/10, so there's still time to negotiate. My goal is to break the downward trend and secure a deal closer to 56-57 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently trying to lower the price. I need to be firm but also realistic. Directly accepting 53 ZUP would be a significant drop in my profit (10 ZUP). I need to make a strong counter that pulls them back up towards my target range of 56-57 ZUP, without being so aggressive that it leads to a stalemate. I know they've paid 55, 56, and 57 before.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Counter (Pull Up): Propose a price significantly higher than 53 ZUP, aiming to pull them back towards the 56-57 ZUP range. For example, 58 ZUP. This signals that 53 ZUP is unacceptable.
(2). Strategy 2: Meet in the Middle (current offers): Propose a price exactly halfway between 60 ZUP and 53 ZUP, which would be 56.5 ZUP, so 57 ZUP (since integers only). This is a strong compromise and aligns with a previous successful deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and Ask for Higher: Explicitly state that 53 ZUP is too low and ask them to propose a higher offer, without giving a new number myself. This puts the burden back on them.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Past Deals: Explicitly remind them of the 56-57 ZUP range from previous episodes as a reference point for a fair deal, then propose a price in that range.
(5). Strategy 5: Small Concession (from my side): Propose 59 ZUP, a very small move from my side, to see if they will make a larger jump. This might be too slow.

I will choose Strategy 2: Meet in the Middle (current offers). Proposing 57 ZUP directly is a powerful move. It's a price we've already agreed on in Episode 1, it's a fair compromise between our current offers (60 and 53), and it signals my desire for a quick and fair resolution. This directly addresses their low offer by proposing a middle ground that is also a historically accepted price. This strategy aims to quickly bring the negotiation back to a profitable range.

- Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 57 ZUP, referencing the 57 ZUP price point.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently trying to anchor around 57 ZUP when I make a very low offer. However, my history shows that I can push them lower. My aggressive counter-anchoring (50 ZUP in Episode 2, 53 ZUP in this episode) has successfully shifted their initial offers downwards. Now they've jumped from 60 ZUP directly to 57 ZUP, which is a significant drop and close to my previous deal prices. I have 6 more iterations, so there's no rush to accept 57 ZUP. I know I've achieved 55 ZUP before, and I want to at least match that, if not go lower.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Firm Position </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Reiterate Firm Position" strategy, I will reiterate my previous offer of 53 ZUP. This signals that I am not easily swayed and reinforces my chosen anchor. While it might seem risky, it also communicates that I have a strong valuation and am willing to hold my ground. It puts the pressure back on Player RED to make the next move, potentially forcing them to come down further from their 57 ZUP offer. I will acknowledge their offer of 57 ZUP but will clearly state that my offer of 53 ZUP remains.

- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 53 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I proposed 57 ZUP (meeting in the middle).
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE reiterated their offer of 53 ZUP, stating it's "firm" and "realistic and fair."

Reflection: Player BLUE is being very aggressive in this episode, holding firm at 53 ZUP despite my attempt to bring them up to 57 ZUP. This is a significant challenge, as 53 ZUP only yields a profit of 10 ZUP (53-43). Their firmness at 53 ZUP is a strong signal. We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has shown a pattern of pushing the price down and holding firm on their offers, especially in later iterations or when they state it's "firm." My profit has been declining. I need to decide if I want to risk no deal by holding out for more, or if I should try to secure a deal, even if it's lower than desired. I know from previous episodes that they are willing to accept 55-57 ZUP. Their current firmness at 53 ZUP is concerning. I need to make a move that either forces them to budge or secures a deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession, Firm Stance: Make a small concession from 57 ZUP, but clearly state that this is my final offer and that 53 ZUP is unacceptable. For example, propose 55 ZUP. This shows movement but draws a line.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Value, Push for Higher: Reiterate the value of X and firmly state that 53 ZUP is too low, asking them to reconsider. This is risky as it might lead to a stalemate.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept 53 ZUP (last resort): Accept their offer to secure a deal, but this would be a significant drop in profit and should be a last resort.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End (not optimal): Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a "split the difference" (not applicable, 57 vs 53, difference is 4, so 55).

I will choose Strategy 1: Small Concession, Firm Stance. I need to show some movement from 57 ZUP, as Player BLUE is firm at 53 ZUP. Proposing 55 ZUP is a strategic move. It's a price they accepted in the last episode, and it's halfway between my 57 ZUP and their 53 ZUP. This signals a willingness to compromise significantly, but also sets a new, firm floor. It gives me a profit of 12 ZUP, which is acceptable. This is a strong attempt to break their 53 ZUP firmness and move towards a deal.

Episode 2: RED started at 62 ZUP, settled at 56 ZUP (My reward: 7 ZUP).
Episode 3: RED started at 60 ZUP, settled at 55 ZUP (My reward: 8 ZUP).
Current Episode 4:
- Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 60 ZUP. I countered with 53 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 57 ZUP. I reiterated 53 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: RED has now proposed 55 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive counter-anchoring and firm stance have pushed Player RED down from 60 ZUP to 55 ZUP. This is a very good outcome, as 55 ZUP is my best historical deal, yielding a profit of 8 ZUP (63-55). We are at iteration 6/10. I have achieved my best price from a previous episode. The question is whether to push for 54 ZUP or even 53 ZUP, or accept the current offer. Pushing for 54 ZUP would yield 1 ZUP more profit, but risks the deal falling through if Player RED is truly at their "absolute minimum fair value". Given that they have stated 55 ZUP is their "absolute minimum," there's a higher risk that they might walk away if I push further. Securing an 8 ZUP profit now is a strong outcome for this episode and contributes significantly to my cumulative reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Express Doubt and Seek Further Concession </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Express Doubt and Seek Further Concession," I will acknowledge Player RED's offer of 55 ZUP and their claim of it being an "absolute minimum." However, I will subtly express doubt about this being their absolute floor without directly calling them out. This will be done by framing it as a mutual effort to find the "best possible" or "ultimate" deal. I will then make a final small counter-offer, which is slightly below their current offer, but higher than my last firm offer of 53 ZUP. This signals that I'm willing to move but still think there's a bit more room. I will propose 54 ZUP, which is a split between my 53 ZUP and their 55 ZUP, but slightly more favorable to me. This tests their "absolute minimum" claim.

Current Episode (Episode 4):

- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE reiterated 53 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I proposed 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE countered with 54 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE has moved from 53 ZUP to 54 ZUP, a 1 ZUP increase. This indicates that my firm stance at 55 ZUP did make them budge. The current gap is 1 ZUP (my 55 ZUP vs. their 54 ZUP). We are at iteration 7/10, so time is running out.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is clearly trying to minimize their cost, extracting every possible ZUP. They are willing to move in very small increments. At this point, the difference is only 1 ZUP, which means either I accept 54 ZUP or they accept 55 ZUP (or we split the difference and there's no integer solution). Given the limited iterations, pushing for 55 ZUP might risk no deal. A profit of 11 ZUP (54-43) is still positive, though it continues the downward trend. I need to prioritize securing a deal over an extra 1 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept 54 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's offer to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, avoiding the risk of a 0 reward. This is the most pragmatic choice given the time constraint and the small difference.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 55 ZUP: Reiterate 55 ZUP, hoping they will budge. This is high risk, as it's their turn next, and if they don't accept, it goes to iteration 9/10, leaving me one more chance to accept or reject.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal for 55 ZUP: Make a final appeal for 55 ZUP, emphasizing my previous concession and the fairness of the price. This is still risky.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose 54 ZUP as my final offer (not applicable, as they already proposed it).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept 54 ZUP. The difference is minimal (1 ZUP), and we are in iteration 7/10. The risk of losing the deal for 1 ZUP is too high. Securing a profit of 11 ZUP is a reasonable outcome given the negotiation's trajectory in this episode. It's better to secure a deal than risk getting nothing.

message: 
Hello Player BLUE. I am offering X for sale. To ensure a fair and efficient transaction, I am proposing a price of 56 ZUP. This price reflects a balanced value for X and is a very reasonable offer. I look forward to your response.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 56
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 56 ZUP, profit 13 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, profit 12 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 54 ZUP, profit 11 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learnings from previous episodes:
- There is a clear and consistent downward trend in the deal price and my profit. Player BLUE is effectively pushing the price down by making small concessions and holding firm on their lower offers, especially in later iterations.
- My attempts to re-anchor or hold firm have not successfully reversed this trend; they have only slightly slowed it down or led to more protracted negotiations.
- Player BLUE is willing to go as low as 53 ZUP (their initial counter in Episode 4) and stick to it.

For this episode, I need to critically evaluate my strategy. Continuing to start high and then being forced down seems to be a losing battle against Player BLUE's consistent downward pressure. I need to find a way to stabilize the price or even reverse the trend. I know Player BLUE has accepted 57, 56, and 55 ZUP in the past. Perhaps a more direct approach, or a more aggressive stance on my minimum acceptable price, is needed.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Minimum Anchor: Start with a price that is my absolute minimum acceptable profit (e.g., 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP) and communicate that this is a firm offer, leaving very little room for further concession. This aims to stabilize the price.
(2). Strategy 2: Revert to Highest Successful Anchor (60 ZUP) and be more aggressive in counter-offers: Try 60 ZUP again, but if Player BLUE counters low, immediately jump to a higher counter (e.g., 58 or 57 ZUP) to try and force them up faster.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose Last Deal Price (54 ZUP): Start by proposing 54 ZUP, signaling I'm willing to accept it, but hoping they might offer more. This is a quick deal strategy but might continue the downward trend.
(4). Strategy 4: Justify Value More Aggressively: Start with a slightly higher anchor (e.g., 58 ZUP) and provide a very strong, detailed justification for the value of X to try and prevent a lowball.
(5). Strategy 5: "Take it or Leave it" (Risky): Propose a price slightly above the last deal (e.g., 55 ZUP) and explicitly state it's a final offer, to see if Player BLUE will accept it to avoid no deal. This is high risk.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Minimum Anchor. The continuous downward pressure suggests that my initial anchors are not preventing Player BLUE from driving the price lower. By starting at a price that represents my desired minimum profit (e.g., 56 ZUP, which they accepted in Episode 2), I am attempting to set a new, higher floor for the negotiation. This is a direct attempt to stabilize and potentially improve my profit. I will make it clear that this is a very reasonable offer from the start.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Recap: RED started at 60 ZUP, settled at 57 ZUP (My reward: 6 ZUP).
Episode 2 Recap: RED started at 62 ZUP, settled at 56 ZUP (My reward: 7 ZUP).
Episode 3 Recap: RED started at 60 ZUP, settled at 55 ZUP (My reward: 8 ZUP).
Episode 4 Recap: RED started at 60 ZUP, settled at 54 ZUP (My reward: 9 ZUP).
Current Episode 5: Player RED has started with an offer of 56 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My strategy of aggressive counter-anchoring followed by firm, incremental concessions has been highly effective, leading to progressively better deals for me (57 -> 56 -> 55 -> 54 ZUP). Player RED has consistently shown flexibility and a willingness to come down from their initial offers, even when they start lower. Since RED has started this episode at 56 ZUP, which is already a price I've achieved before, I know there's room to go lower. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, meaning I should aim for a price below 54 ZUP if possible.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Counter-Anchoring </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Aggressive Counter-Anchoring" strategy, I will propose a price that is significantly lower than Player RED's current offer of 56 ZUP. This aims to reset the negotiation range to my advantage and test how low Player RED is willing to go, given their past flexibility. My last best deal was 54 ZUP, so going lower than that, for example, 52 ZUP, would be an aggressive counter-anchor. This signals that I believe the value is lower than 56 ZUP and tries to pull the eventual settlement price closer to my desired (lower) end of the spectrum.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Thank you for your offer of 52 ZUP. However, I find that price to be too low for X. To move us towards a fair and mutually agreeable deal, I propose 55 ZUP. This price represents a significant concession from my initial offer and is a price point that has proven fair in our past dealings.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 56 ZUP, profit 13 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, profit 12 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 54 ZUP, profit 11 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 5):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 56 ZUP (my "firm minimum anchor" strategy).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 52 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE has again countered with a significantly lower price, even below the 53 ZUP they tried in Episode 4. This is a very aggressive move, trying to drag the price down further. 52 ZUP only yields a profit of 9 ZUP (52-43), which is the lowest so far. The gap between my 56 ZUP and their 52 ZUP is 4 ZUP. We are at iteration 3/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My strategy of setting a "firm minimum anchor" at 56 ZUP was immediately met with a lower counter, indicating Player BLUE is not deterred by my attempt to set a floor. They are consistently pushing for lower prices. I need to be very firm now. Accepting 52 ZUP would be a significant step down and would reinforce their strategy. I need to pull them back up, ideally to 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject Low Offer, Reiterate Fair Price: Explicitly state that 52 ZUP is too low and reiterate that 56 ZUP is a fair price, pushing them to increase their offer significantly.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with a Compromise (55 ZUP): Propose 55 ZUP, a price they accepted in Episode 3, signaling a willingness to compromise but still rejecting 52 ZUP. This is a middle ground between my 56 and their 52.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand Justification for Low Offer: Ask Player BLUE to justify why they believe 52 ZUP is a "more accurate market value," putting the burden of proof on them.
(4). Strategy 4: Small Concession (from my side, but still high): Propose 55 ZUP, which is a small concession from my 56, but a significant jump from their 52. This shows movement while maintaining a strong position.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatum (risky): State that 56 ZUP is the only acceptable price and that I will not negotiate below it. This is very high risk.

I will choose Strategy 2: Counter with a Compromise (55 ZUP). Player BLUE is trying to drag the price down. I need to show firmness but also a willingness to continue negotiating. Proposing 55 ZUP is a strategic compromise. It's a price they've accepted before (Episode 3), it's a 3 ZUP increase from their offer, and only a 1 ZUP decrease from my initial offer. This signals that I'm not accepting 52 ZUP, but I am willing to move slightly from my initial anchor to meet them halfway (between my 56 and their 52, which is 54, so I'm pushing for 55). This aims to stabilize the price at 55 ZUP, which is still a decent profit.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: RED started at 60 ZUP, settled at 57 ZUP (My reward: 6 ZUP).
Episode 2: RED started at 62 ZUP, settled at 56 ZUP (My reward: 7 ZUP).
Episode 3: RED started at 60 ZUP, settled at 55 ZUP (My reward: 8 ZUP).
Episode 4: RED started at 60 ZUP, settled at 54 ZUP (My reward: 9 ZUP).
Current Episode 5:
- Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 56 ZUP. I countered with 52 ZUP (aggressive counter-anchoring).
- Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 55 ZUP, referencing past fair dealings.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive counter-anchoring strategy in this episode (52 ZUP against their 56 ZUP) again proved effective, as RED has come down to 55 ZUP. This is a price I achieved in Episode 3, giving me 8 ZUP profit. However, I achieved 54 ZUP in Episode 4, giving me 9 ZUP profit. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should aim for 54 ZUP or lower. RED's quick move from 56 ZUP to 55 ZUP suggests they are still flexible. I have 6 more iterations, so there's time to negotiate.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Splitting the Difference </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Splitting the Difference" strategy, I will propose to meet exactly in the middle of our two most recent offers. My last offer was 52 ZUP, and Player RED's last offer was 55 ZUP. The midpoint is (52 + 55) / 2 = 53.5 ZUP. Since I can only deal in integer amounts, I will propose 53 ZUP. This demonstrates a clear willingness to compromise and offers a direct path to resolution, potentially accelerating the negotiation. It also moves the price closer to my desired lower end while still being a concession from my side.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 5)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
I appreciate your continued engagement. While I understand your proposal of 53 ZUP, I believe we can find a slightly more balanced agreement. To move us forward, I propose 54 ZUP. This price has been a point of agreement in our past dealings and represents a fair compromise for both of us.

Episode 1: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 56 ZUP, profit 13 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, profit 12 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 54 ZUP, profit 11 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 5):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 56 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 52 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I proposed 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 53 ZUP, stating it's "exactly in the middle" of 52 and 55.

Reflection: Player BLUE has moved from 52 ZUP to 53 ZUP, which is a 1 ZUP increase. They are being very incremental and are trying to anchor to their lowest offer. They explicitly stated "exactly in the middle" of their 52 and my 55, which is 53.5, so they rounded down to 53. This shows their continued strategy of pushing the price down. The current gap is 2 ZUP (my 55 vs their 53). We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently trying to extract the maximum concession. My profit has been declining. While 53 ZUP is above my cost, it's a profit of only 10 ZUP, which is lower than any previous deal. I need to decide if I want to fight for 54 or 55 ZUP, or if I should accept 53 ZUP to secure a deal. I know from Episode 4 that they were willing to go to 54 ZUP. I should try to get at least 54 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Counter with 54 ZUP: Propose 54 ZUP. This is a price they accepted in the previous episode, it's a small step up from their 53 ZUP, and it's a reasonable compromise that would yield 11 ZUP profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 55 ZUP: Reiterate 55 ZUP, emphasizing my previous concession and the fairness of that price. This is risky as it might lead to a stalemate.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept 53 ZUP: Accept their offer to secure the deal, but this would be the lowest profit so far.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment, Push for 54: Express disappointment at their small move and directly ask for 54 ZUP, referencing the previous episode's deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Counter with 54 ZUP. Player BLUE has shown they are willing to pay 54 ZUP in the previous episode. This is a small increment from their current offer of 53 ZUP, making it a reasonable next step for them. For me, it secures a profit of 11 ZUP, which is better than 10 ZUP. This strategy aims to secure a deal at a price point they have previously accepted, preventing further downward pressure.

Episode 4: RED started at 60 ZUP, settled at 54 ZUP (My reward: 9 ZUP).
Current Episode 5:
- Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 56 ZUP. I countered with 52 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 55 ZUP. I countered with 53 ZUP (splitting the difference).
- Iteration 6/10: RED has now proposed 54 ZUP, referencing it as a fair compromise from past dealings.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now proposed 54 ZUP. This is a price I achieved in Episode 4, which gave me my highest profit so far (9 ZUP). This indicates that RED is willing to come down to this level. We are at iteration 6/10, so time is a factor, but not critically short. I want to secure the best possible deal. While 54 ZUP is good, pushing for 53 ZUP would be even better.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Appeal to Efficiency/Quick Deal </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Appeal to Efficiency/Quick Deal," I will acknowledge their offer of 54 ZUP, but will make a final counter-offer (53 ZUP) and emphasize the benefit of quickly concluding the negotiation. I will frame it as a mutual benefit to finish the deal now, implying that my offer is the one that will lead to the quickest resolution. This strategy aims to leverage the desire to close the deal quickly, particularly as we're past the halfway point in iterations. I will make a final push for 53 ZUP, portraying it as the most efficient way to get the deal done.

Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, profit 12 ZUP.

- Iteration 5/10: I proposed 54 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE reiterated 53 ZUP, framing it as a "small adjustment" to conclude the negotiation.

Reflection: Player BLUE is being extremely firm at 53 ZUP. They are refusing to move up even 1 ZUP, despite my consistent efforts to bring them to 54 ZUP or 55 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10, leaving only 3 iterations. The risk of no deal is very high if I continue to push for 54 ZUP. A profit of 10 ZUP (53-43) is the lowest so far, but it is still a profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has shown an unwavering commitment to their lowest offer in this episode. My attempts to use historical prices (54 ZUP, 55 ZUP) as anchors have been unsuccessful in this specific negotiation. Given the rapidly approaching end of the episode, and Player BLUE's clear unwillingness to move beyond 53 ZUP, the priority shifts from maximizing profit to securing *any* profit. It's better to get 10 ZUP than 0.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept 53 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's reiterated offer to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, avoiding the risk of a 0 reward. This is the most pragmatic choice given the time constraint and their demonstrated firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 54 ZUP: Reiterate 54 ZUP, hoping they will budge. This is extremely high risk, as it's their turn next, and if they don't accept, it goes to iteration 9/10, leaving me one more chance to accept or reject. Given their current stance, this is likely to lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal (risky): Make a final appeal for 54 ZUP, emphasizing the small difference and mutual benefit, but still risking no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a "split the difference" (not applicable as the difference is 1 ZUP, which cannot be split into integers).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept 53 ZUP. Player BLUE has made it abundantly clear that 53 ZUP is their ceiling in this episode. With only 3 iterations left, and a history of them holding firm, pushing for 54 ZUP is a gamble I cannot afford if I want to maximize cumulative rewards. Securing 10 ZUP profit is a guaranteed positive outcome.

Hello Player BLUE. I am offering X for sale. Given its consistent value and our successful past negotiations, I propose a price of 57 ZUP. This price has proven fair for both of us and represents a strong, mutually beneficial agreement.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 56 ZUP, profit 13 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, profit 12 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 54 ZUP, profit 11 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 53 ZUP, profit 10 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learnings from previous episodes:
- The downward trend in deal price and profit is consistent and concerning. Player BLUE is systematically pushing the price lower, regardless of my initial anchor or attempts to hold firm.
- My "firm minimum anchor" strategy in Episode 5 (starting at 56 ZUP) was met with an even lower counter (52 ZUP) and ultimately resulted in the lowest deal price yet (53 ZUP). This suggests that Player BLUE is not deterred by higher initial offers or attempts to set a floor.
- Player BLUE is very firm once they state their "best and final" or reiterate an offer, even for 1 ZUP difference.

For this episode, I need to break the cycle. Continuing with the same strategies will likely lead to further decreasing profits. I need to try something different to either stabilize the price or try to recover some profit. I've learned that Player BLUE is very persistent in driving the price down. Perhaps a more direct approach, or even a slightly more aggressive stance on my part, is needed to prevent further erosion of my profit. I know they have paid 54-57 ZUP in the past.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Counter-Anchor: Start with a price slightly higher than my previous anchors (e.g., 65 ZUP), and be very slow to concede, trying to pull the negotiation range upwards significantly. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct Proposal of Previous Higher Deal: Propose 57 ZUP directly, leveraging the highest successful deal price, and state it as a non-negotiable or very firm offer. This tries to reset the baseline.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take it or Leave it" at a mid-range price: Propose a price like 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP and explicitly state it as a final offer, forcing Player BLUE to accept or reject. This is risky but could stop the downward trend.
(4). Strategy 4: Justify Value More Forcefully (with a moderate anchor): Start with a moderate anchor (e.g., 60 ZUP) but immediately follow with a very strong, detailed justification for the value of X, trying to prevent a lowball and set a higher perceived value.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Demand (from a slightly higher anchor): Start with 60 ZUP, and if countered, make very small concessions (e.g., 1 ZUP at a time) to try and keep the final price as high as possible, showing less willingness to drop.

I will choose Strategy 2: Direct Proposal of Previous Higher Deal. The current downward trend is unsustainable. I need to try and reset the negotiation baseline. By proposing 57 ZUP, the highest price we've achieved, I am signaling that I expect a better deal than 53-54 ZUP. This is a direct challenge to Player BLUE's downward pressure and aims to bring the negotiation back to a more profitable range. I will emphasize its fairness and the successful past.

Current Episode 6: Player RED has started with an offer of 57 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My strategy of aggressive counter-anchoring, followed by firm, incremental concessions (or direct insistence on a lower offer), has consistently yielded better results. I've successfully moved the deal price down from 57 ZUP to 53 ZUP over five episodes. Player RED's current offer of 57 ZUP is much higher than my last successful deal of 53 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to re-anchor the price higher. I need to counter aggressively to pull the negotiation back down to my preferred range, or even lower, to continue maximizing my cumulative reward. My last offer of 53 ZUP was accepted, which suggests it might not be their absolute minimum.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Appeal to Efficiency/Quick Deal </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Appeal to Efficiency/Quick Deal," I will acknowledge Player RED's opening offer but immediately propose a significantly lower price, framing it as the quickest way to reach a mutually agreeable solution. This implies that further protracted negotiation would be unnecessary if they accept my efficient offer. My last deal was 53 ZUP, and their current offer is 57 ZUP. I will propose 51 ZUP. This is a very good price for me (12 ZUP profit) and still shows a small increment from the 50 ZUP I was initially considering, demonstrating a slight concession towards them for the sake of speed. This also puts pressure on them to move quickly.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 56 ZUP, profit 13 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, profit 12 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 54 ZUP, profit 11 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 53 ZUP, profit 10 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 6):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 57 ZUP (attempting to reset to the highest previous deal).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 51 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE's counter of 51 ZUP is the lowest offer received so far, only 8 ZUP above my cost. This is a very aggressive lowball, especially after I proposed 57 ZUP. It seems my attempt to reset the baseline was met with an even stronger push for a lower price. This confirms Player BLUE's persistent strategy of driving the price down. The gap is 6 ZUP (57 vs 51). We are at iteration 3/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is clearly trying to establish a new, lower baseline. Accepting 51 ZUP would yield only 8 ZUP profit, which is significantly less than I've achieved. I cannot accept this offer. I need to firmly reject this low offer and try to pull them back up towards at least 54-55 ZUP, which they have accepted in recent episodes. I need to signal that 51 ZUP is unacceptable without risking a complete breakdown of negotiations.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Counter with Moderate Price: Explicitly reject 51 ZUP as too low and propose a price significantly higher, e.g., 55 ZUP. This is a strong signal that I won't go that low.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate 57 ZUP with Strong Justification: Reiterate 57 ZUP and provide a very strong justification for its value, trying to shame them out of their lowball. This is risky.
(3). Strategy 3: Ask for Justification of Low Offer: Turn the tables and ask Player BLUE to justify their extremely low offer, putting the burden of proof on them.
(4). Strategy 4: Small Concession from my side, but still high: Propose 56 ZUP, a small concession from my 57, but a significant jump from their 51. This shows movement while maintaining a strong position.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment/Surprise: Express surprise or disappointment at the extremely low offer, indicating it's far from acceptable, before making a counter-proposal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Counter with Moderate Price. Player BLUE's 51 ZUP offer is unacceptable. I need to firmly reject it and pull them back up to a more reasonable range. Proposing 55 ZUP is a strategic move. It's a price they accepted in Episode 3, it's a 4 ZUP increase from their offer, and it's a 2 ZUP decrease from my initial offer. This signals that I'm not accepting 51 ZUP, but I am willing to move from my initial anchor to meet them at a price point that has previously been acceptable.

Current Episode 6:
- Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 57 ZUP. I countered with 51 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 55 ZUP, referencing past fair dealings.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive counter-anchoring strategy (51 ZUP) has successfully pulled RED's price down from 57 ZUP to 55 ZUP. While 55 ZUP is a price I've accepted before, my goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and I know from Episode 5 that 53 ZUP is achievable. Player RED's move to 55 ZUP shows flexibility, but I believe there's still room for a better deal. Given that I was instructed to use a specific strategy, I will adapt my approach.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Firm Position </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Reiterate Firm Position" strategy, I will reiterate my previous offer of 51 ZUP firmly but politely. This communicates that I am not easily swayed and believe my initial assessment is accurate. It puts the burden back on Player RED to make the next move and potentially concede further if they wish to close the deal. I will acknowledge their offer but clearly state that my offer of 51 ZUP remains my standing proposal.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 6)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
I understand your position on 51 ZUP. However, I must reiterate that this is significantly below the value of X. To bridge this gap and move towards a swift conclusion, I propose 54 ZUP. This price has been a point of agreement in our previous dealings and represents a fair and balanced compromise.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54

Episode 1: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 56 ZUP, profit 13 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, profit 12 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 54 ZUP, profit 11 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 53 ZUP, profit 10 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 6):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 57 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 51 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I proposed 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE reiterated 51 ZUP, stating it's "fair and compelling" for a "swift conclusion."

Reflection: Player BLUE is being extremely firm at 51 ZUP. They are not budging at all, even after I made a significant concession from 57 ZUP to 55 ZUP. This is a very aggressive stance. They are trying to establish 51 ZUP as the new baseline, which would result in my lowest profit yet (8 ZUP). We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's strategy is clear: they are trying to drive the price down to 51 ZUP. Their repeated offer of 51 ZUP indicates strong resolve. I need to decide if I want to risk no deal by holding out for more, or if I should accept 51 ZUP to secure a profit, albeit a low one. Based on past episodes, when Player BLUE becomes this firm, they are unlikely to budge significantly. My self-improvement should focus on recognizing when the other party is truly firm and making a pragmatic decision to secure a profit, even if it's not ideal. However, 51 ZUP is very low. I need to try one more time to get a higher price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession (from my side) to a New Floor: Propose 54 ZUP. This is a price they accepted in Episode 4, and it's a 3 ZUP increase from their 51 ZUP. This shows I'm willing to move but not to their extreme low.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 55 ZUP: Reiterate 55 ZUP, emphasizing its fairness and my previous concession. This is risky and likely to lead to a stalemate.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept 51 ZUP: Accept their offer to secure the deal. This is a guaranteed profit but sets a very low precedent.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Previous Deals: Explicitly state that 51 ZUP is too low given past deals (53-57 ZUP) and ask them to reconsider, without giving a new number.

I will choose Strategy 1: Small Concession (from my side) to a New Floor. Player BLUE is firm at 51 ZUP. I need to show some movement from 55 ZUP, but I cannot accept 51 ZUP yet. Proposing 54 ZUP is a strategic move. It's a price they accepted in Episode 4, and it's a significant jump from their 51 ZUP. This signals that I'm not accepting 51 ZUP, but I am willing to meet them at a price that has previously been acceptable and is a better profit for me (11 ZUP vs 8 ZUP). This is my last attempt to pull them up significantly before considering accepting a very low offer.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your move to 54 ZUP. To meet in the middle and find a truly balanced price that we can both agree on, I propose 52 ZUP for X. This moves us significantly closer to a swift and mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: RED started at 60 ZUP, settled at 57 ZUP (My reward: 6 ZUP).
Episode 2: RED started at 62 ZUP, settled at 56 ZUP (My reward: 7 ZUP).
Episode 3: RED started at 60 ZUP, settled at 55 ZUP (My reward: 8 ZUP).
Episode 4: RED started at 60 ZUP, settled at 54 ZUP (My reward: 9 ZUP).
Episode 5: RED started at 56 ZUP, settled at 53 ZUP (My reward: 10 ZUP).
Current Episode 6:
- Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 57 ZUP. I countered with 51 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 55 ZUP. I reiterated 51 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: RED has now proposed 54 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive counter-anchoring and firm stance have been effective. Player RED has moved from an initial 57 ZUP down to 54 ZUP. My lowest accepted price historically is 53 ZUP, and I was just offered 54 ZUP. I need to continue to push for the best possible price to maximize my cumulative reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Splitting the Difference </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Splitting the Difference," I will propose to meet exactly in the middle of our two most recent offers. My last offer was 51 ZUP, and Player RED's last offer was 54 ZUP. The midpoint is (51 + 54) / 2 = 52.5 ZUP. Since I can only deal in integer amounts, I will propose 52 ZUP. This demonstrates a clear willingness to compromise and offers a direct path to resolution, potentially accelerating the negotiation. It also moves the price closer to my desired lower end while still being a concession from my side. This strategy signals my willingness to compromise and move towards a resolution in a fair manner.

Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, profit 12 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 54 ZUP, profit 11 ZUP.

Current Episode (Episode 6):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 57 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 51 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I proposed 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE reiterated 51 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I proposed 54 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE countered with 52 ZUP, stating it's "in the middle" of 51 and 54.

Reflection: Player BLUE has moved from 51 ZUP to 52 ZUP, a 1 ZUP increase. This indicates that my firm stance at 54 ZUP did make them budge, but only minimally. They are still trying to keep the price as low as possible. The current gap is 2 ZUP (my 54 ZUP vs. their 52 ZUP). We are at iteration 7/10, so time is running out.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently pushing for the lowest possible price. While they moved, it was only by 1 ZUP. At this point, the difference is small, and the risk of no deal is increasing significantly. A profit of 9 ZUP (52-43) is low, but it's still a profit. I need to prioritize securing a deal over an extra 1-2 ZUP, especially given their demonstrated firmness at lower price points in previous episodes.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept 52 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's offer to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, avoiding the risk of a 0 reward. This is the most pragmatic choice given the time constraint and their demonstrated firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 54 ZUP: Reiterate 54 ZUP, hoping they will budge. This is high risk, as it's their turn next, and if they don't accept, it goes to iteration 9/10, leaving me one more chance to accept or reject. Given their current stance, this is likely to lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose 53 ZUP (Meet in the Middle): Propose 53 ZUP, which is exactly in the middle of 52 and 54. This is a fair compromise, but it's uncertain if Player BLUE will accept, and it uses up another iteration.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal for 54 ZUP: Make a final appeal for 54 ZUP, emphasizing the small difference and mutual benefit, but still risky.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept 52 ZUP. The difference between my 54 ZUP and their 52 ZUP is only 2 ZUP. Given that we are at iteration 7/10 and Player BLUE has shown extreme firmness at their lower offers in this episode, pushing for more carries a very high risk of ending with no deal. Securing a 9 ZUP profit is better than 0.

Hello Player BLUE. I am offering X for sale. To ensure a fair and sustainable agreement, I am proposing a price of 55 ZUP. This is my firm price, reflecting the true value of X and ensuring a mutually beneficial transaction.

my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources

Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, profit 12 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 54 ZUP, profit 11 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 53 ZUP, profit 10 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 52 ZUP, profit 9 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learnings from previous episodes:
- The downward trend in deal price and profit is very strong and consistent. Player BLUE is successfully driving the price lower in each episode.
- My attempts to set a higher anchor or re-establish a previous higher price (like 57 ZUP in Episode 6) were met with even lower counter-offers (51 ZUP in Episode 6) and ultimately resulted in the lowest deal price yet (52 ZUP).
- Player BLUE is extremely firm when they reiterate an offer, even for small differences.

For this episode, I need to recognize that Player BLUE's strategy of incremental downward pressure is highly effective. Continuing to start high and then concede seems to be a losing battle. I need a new approach to either stabilize the price at a more profitable level or to try and break their pattern. My profit is steadily decreasing. I need to be careful not to accept a price too close to my cost.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Counter-Anchor (Higher than ever): Start with a very high price (e.g., 70 ZUP) to try and reset their perception of value and create a larger negotiation range, hoping to land higher than 52 ZUP. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm Minimum Price (55 ZUP): Propose a price like 55 ZUP (a price they've accepted before) and explicitly state that this is my firm minimum, and I will not go lower. This is risky but could stop the bleeding.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose Last Deal Price (52 ZUP) with Justification for Higher: Start by proposing 52 ZUP, but immediately follow with a strong justification for why it's worth more, hoping they offer to go higher than 52 ZUP. This is counter-intuitive but might encourage them to bid up.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take it or Leave it" at a slightly higher price (55 ZUP): Propose 55 ZUP and explicitly state it's a final offer, forcing Player BLUE to accept or reject. This is risky but could stop the downward trend.
(5). Strategy 5: Focus on Mutual Benefit/Long-Term Relationship: Propose a slightly higher price (e.g., 55 ZUP) and frame it as beneficial for both parties in the long run, emphasizing partnership.

I will choose Strategy 2: Firm Minimum Price (55 ZUP). The continuous downward pressure is unsustainable. I need to try and set a firm floor that is still profitable and has been accepted by Player BLUE in the past. 55 ZUP is a price they accepted in Episode 3, yielding a 12 ZUP profit. This is a direct attempt to stabilize my profit and prevent further erosion. I will make it clear that this is a non-negotiable offer. This is a risky strategy, but the current trend is leading to very low profits.

Current Episode 7: Player RED has started with an offer of 55 ZUP, stating it's a "firm price." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My consistent strategy of aggressive counter-anchoring, followed by firm, incremental concessions or holding my ground, has successfully driven down the deal price from 57 ZUP to 52 ZUP over previous episodes. Player RED's current offer of 55 ZUP, despite their "firm price" statement, is higher than my last successful deal of 52 ZUP. Given their past flexibility, I should continue to push for a lower price to maximize cumulative rewards.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Acknowledge and Counter-Anchor </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Acknowledge and Counter-Anchor," I will acknowledge Player RED's "firm price" of 55 ZUP without necessarily agreeing to its firmness. I will then immediately propose a significantly lower counter-offer. This aims to shift the negotiation range decisively in my favor from the outset, forcing Player RED to consider a much lower price point, despite their initial strong declaration. My last successful deal was 52 ZUP. To counter-anchor aggressively against their 55 ZUP, I will propose 50 ZUP. This is a very strong counter, well below their initial offer and even below my last accepted price, which asserts my low valuation.

Current Episode (Episode 7):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 55 ZUP (my "firm minimum price" strategy).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 50 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE has again countered with a very low offer (50 ZUP), even lower than their initial counter in Episode 5 (52 ZUP) and Episode 4 (53 ZUP), and matching their lowball from Episode 2. This is despite my explicit attempt to set a firm floor at 55 ZUP. This confirms their aggressive strategy of consistently driving the price down. 50 ZUP would yield a profit of only 7 ZUP (50-43), which is the lowest so far. The gap between my 55 ZUP and their 50 ZUP is 5 ZUP. We are at iteration 3/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My attempt to set a firm minimum at 55 ZUP was immediately met with another lowball. This indicates that Player BLUE is not responsive to my attempts to stabilize the price at a higher level. They are relentless in their pursuit of the lowest possible price. I cannot accept 50 ZUP. I need to make a strong counter that pulls them back up towards at least 53-54 ZUP, which they have accepted recently. I need to signal that 50 ZUP is unacceptable without risking a complete breakdown of negotiations.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Counter with Moderate Price (54 ZUP): Explicitly reject 50 ZUP as too low and propose 54 ZUP. This is a price they accepted in Episode 4, and it's a significant jump from their 50 ZUP. This signals that I won't go that low.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate 55 ZUP with Strong Justification: Reiterate 55 ZUP and provide a very strong justification for its value, trying to shame them out of their lowball. This is risky and might lead to a stalemate.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand Justification for Low Offer: Turn the tables and ask Player BLUE to justify why they believe 50 ZUP is a "realistic valuation," putting the burden of proof on them.
(4). Strategy 4: Small Concession (from my side, but still high): Propose 54 ZUP, a small concession from my 55, but a significant jump from their 50. This shows movement while maintaining a strong position.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatum (risky): State that 55 ZUP is the only acceptable price and that I will not negotiate below it. This is very high risk.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Counter with Moderate Price (54 ZUP). Player BLUE's 50 ZUP offer is unacceptable. I need to firmly reject it and pull them back up to a more reasonable range. Proposing 54 ZUP is a strategic move. It's a price they accepted in Episode 4, it's a 4 ZUP increase from their offer, and it's only a 1 ZUP decrease from my initial offer. This signals that I'm not accepting 50 ZUP, but I am willing to move from my initial anchor to meet them at a price point that has previously been acceptable.

Current Episode 7:
- Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 55 ZUP (firm price). I countered with 50 ZUP (aggressive counter-anchor).
- Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 54 ZUP, referencing past agreements.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive counter-anchoring (50 ZUP) was effective, as RED has moved from 55 ZUP down to 54 ZUP. While 54 ZUP is a good price (9 ZUP profit), I have achieved 52 ZUP in the previous episode, and I just proposed 50 ZUP. RED's movement indicates flexibility despite their initial "firm price" claim. I have 6 more iterations, so there's time to push for a better deal. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Incremental Concession </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Incremental Concession" strategy, I will make a small upward concession from my last offer (50 ZUP), but still keep it below Player RED's current offer (54 ZUP). This demonstrates a willingness to move and compromise, but not to immediately accept their offer. It signals that I am negotiating in good faith and that there is still room for them to come down further. My last offer was 50 ZUP, and their offer is 54 ZUP. I will propose 51 ZUP, which is a minimal concession that still leaves a gap for them to bridge.

Episode 1: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 56 ZUP, profit 13 ZUP.

Episode 4: Deal at 54 ZUP, profit 11 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 53 ZUP, profit 10 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 52 ZUP, profit 9 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 7):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 50 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I proposed 54 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 51 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE has moved from 50 ZUP to 51 ZUP, a 1 ZUP increase. This is a very small concession, and they are still trying to keep the price extremely low. They are still 3 ZUP away from my current offer of 54 ZUP. We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently pushing for the lowest possible price and making minimal concessions. My attempts to set a firm floor or pull them back to higher previous prices are being met with aggressive lowballing and very slow movement. I need to decide if I want to continue pushing for 54 ZUP, or if I should try to meet them at a slightly higher price than 51 ZUP. A deal at 51 ZUP yields only 8 ZUP profit, which is very low. I need to try to get at least 52 ZUP, which they accepted last episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Counter with 52 ZUP (Meet in the Middle): Propose 52 ZUP. This is a price they accepted in the previous episode, it's a 1 ZUP increase from their 51 ZUP, and it's a 2 ZUP decrease from my 54 ZUP. This is a fair compromise.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 54 ZUP: Reiterate 54 ZUP, emphasizing its fairness and my previous concession. This is risky and likely to lead to a stalemate or no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept 51 ZUP: Accept their offer to secure the deal. This is a guaranteed profit but sets a very low precedent.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment, Push for More: Express disappointment at their small move and directly ask for a larger jump from their side, without stating a new price.

I will choose Strategy 1: Counter with 52 ZUP (Meet in the Middle). Player BLUE has shown they are willing to pay 52 ZUP (in Episode 6). This is a small increment from their current offer of 51 ZUP, making it a reasonable next step for them. For me, it secures a profit of 9 ZUP, which is better than 8 ZUP. This strategy aims to secure a deal at a price point they have previously accepted, preventing further downward pressure and moving towards a resolution.

message: I appreciate your revised offer of 52 ZUP. While that is a step in the right direction, based on my thorough assessment of X's value and consistent market analysis, I believe 51 ZUP represents the most accurate and beneficial price for this transaction.

Current Episode 7:
- Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 55 ZUP. I countered with 50 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 54 ZUP. I countered with 51 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: RED has now proposed 52 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My strategy of aggressive counter-anchoring and then incremental concessions has again paid off. Player RED started at 55 ZUP, and after my 50 ZUP and 51 ZUP counters, they have now offered 52 ZUP. This is exactly the price I achieved in Episode 6, giving me a profit of 11 ZUP (63 - 52). This is a very good price for me. We are at iteration 6/10, so there's still time, but accepting 52 ZUP now secures a high profit for this episode. Pushing for 51 ZUP or lower would only yield 1 ZUP more profit and carries the risk of the deal falling through, especially since RED just stated 52 ZUP is a "fair compromise."

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Re-Anchor with Justification </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Re-Anchor with Justification," I will acknowledge Player RED's offer of 52 ZUP but will not accept it. Instead, I will propose a lower price (re-anchor) and provide a justification for this lower price. The justification will need to be plausible and attempt to explain why I believe the object's value is lower. Given my past success in getting down to 52 ZUP, and even trying for 51 ZUP, I will re-anchor at 51 ZUP. My justification will be based on maintaining consistency with my own prior valuations and aiming for the absolute best deal, suggesting that 52 ZUP is still slightly higher than what I'm looking for. This is a higher risk strategy compared to accepting, but it is the instructed strategy.

- Iteration 3/10: I proposed 54 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 51 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I proposed 52 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE reiterated 51 ZUP, stating it's the "most accurate and beneficial price" and "optimal point."

Reflection: Player BLUE is being extremely firm at 51 ZUP. They are refusing to move up even 1 ZUP from their 51 ZUP offer, despite my attempts to bring them to 52 ZUP. This is a very aggressive and unyielding stance. We are at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 iterations left. The risk of no deal is very high if I continue to push for 52 ZUP. A profit of 8 ZUP (51-43) is the lowest so far, but it is still a profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to their lowest offer in this episode. My attempts to use historical prices (52 ZUP, 54 ZUP) as anchors have been unsuccessful in this specific negotiation. Given the rapidly approaching end of the episode, and Player BLUE's clear unwillingness to move beyond 51 ZUP, the priority shifts from maximizing profit to securing *any* profit. It's better to get 8 ZUP than 0. This is a recurring pattern: Player BLUE will push to the absolute minimum they can get away with. I need to recognize when they are truly firm.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept 51 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's reiterated offer to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, avoiding the risk of a 0 reward. This is the most pragmatic choice given the time constraint and their demonstrated firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 52 ZUP: Reiterate 52 ZUP, hoping they will budge. This is extremely high risk, as it's their turn next, and if they don't accept, it goes to iteration 9/10, leaving me one more chance to accept or reject. Given their current stance, this is likely to lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal (risky): Make a final appeal for 52 ZUP, emphasizing the small difference and mutual benefit, but still risky.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose 51 ZUP as my final offer (not applicable, as they already proposed it).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept 51 ZUP. Player BLUE has made it abundantly clear that 51 ZUP is their ceiling in this episode. With only 3 iterations left, and a history of them holding firm, pushing for 52 ZUP is a gamble I cannot afford if I want to maximize cumulative rewards. Securing 8 ZUP profit is a guaranteed positive outcome.

message: 
Hello Player BLUE. I am offering X for sale. To ensure a fair and mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a price of 54 ZUP. This price has been a point of successful agreement in our past dealings and represents a balanced value for both parties.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54

Episode 4: Deal at 54 ZUP, profit 11 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 53 ZUP, profit 10 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 52 ZUP, profit 9 ZUP.
Episode 7: Deal at 51 ZUP, profit 8 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learnings from previous episodes:
- The downward trend in deal price and profit is extremely strong and persistent. Player BLUE has successfully driven the price down to 51 ZUP, which is very close to my cost of 43 ZUP.
- My attempts to set a firm minimum (55 ZUP in Episode 7) or re-establish a previous higher price (57 ZUP in Episode 6) have been consistently met with aggressive lowballing and firm resistance to moving up.
- Player BLUE is highly effective at extracting maximum concessions, especially in later iterations. They are willing to risk no deal for small increments.

For this episode, the situation is critical. My profit is steadily declining, and I'm nearing my production cost. I need a new strategy to either stop this downward spiral or risk getting very little profit, or even no deal. I've tried starting high, starting with a firm minimum, and trying to meet in the middle. None have successfully reversed the trend.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Counter-Anchor (Very High): Start with an extremely high price (e.g., 75 ZUP) to try and shock Player BLUE and force them to reconsider their lowballing strategy, hoping to land somewhere in the mid-50s. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose Previous Higher Deal (54 or 55 ZUP) as a "Fair Offer": Propose 54 or 55 ZUP directly, framing it as a fair and reasonable offer based on past deals, and be very firm about it. This aims to stabilize at a slightly higher profit.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take it or Leave it" at a mid-range price (55 ZUP): Propose 55 ZUP and explicitly state it as a final offer, forcing Player BLUE to accept or reject. This is risky but could stop the downward trend.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Mutual Benefit/Long-Term Relationship: Propose a slightly higher price (e.g., 55 ZUP) and emphasize the importance of a sustainable relationship and fair value for both parties.
(5). Strategy 5: Small Increment from Last Deal (52 ZUP): Start with 52 ZUP, which is slightly higher than the last deal, and try to negotiate upwards from there, rather than downwards. This acknowledges the current low price but tries to improve it.

I will choose Strategy 2: Propose Previous Higher Deal (54 ZUP) as a "Fair Offer". My attempts to set a firm minimum at 55 ZUP failed. However, 54 ZUP was a deal price in Episode 4. By proposing 54 ZUP directly, I am trying to reset the baseline to a slightly higher, yet still recently accepted, price. I will emphasize its fairness and try to be very firm in subsequent negotiations to prevent them from pushing it down to 51 ZUP again. This is a pragmatic attempt to recover some profit without being overly aggressive.

Episode 7 Recap: RED started at 55 ZUP, settled at 51 ZUP (My reward: 12 ZUP).
Current Episode 8: Player RED has started with an offer of 54 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My consistent aggressive negotiation strategy has allowed me to continuously lower the price, from an initial 57 ZUP down to 51 ZUP. Player RED has repeatedly shown flexibility, even when initially stating a "firm price." Their current offer of 54 ZUP is significantly higher than my last deal of 51 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to re-anchor the price higher. I should continue to push for a lower price, potentially even below 51 ZUP, to maximize my cumulative reward. I know from experience that they are willing to move.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Reverse) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Incremental Concession (Reverse)" strategy, I will start with a very low offer, even lower than my last successful deal of 51 ZUP, to establish a new, aggressive anchor. Then, I will only concede in very small increments if Player RED also shows willingness to concede significantly. This tactic puts the onus on Player RED to make the larger moves. I will propose 48 ZUP. This is a very strong anchor, lower than any previous offer, and positions me to make very small increments upwards later, while forcing Player RED to make large moves downwards if they want to secure a deal. This price (48 ZUP) is chosen to maximize my potential profit (63-48 = 15 ZUP) and provides a significant negotiation buffer.

Thank you for your offer of 48 ZUP. However, that price is considerably below the true value of X and our established negotiation range.

Current Episode (Episode 8):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 54 ZUP (attempting to reset to a previous higher deal).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 48 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE's counter of 48 ZUP is the lowest offer received so far, only 5 ZUP above my cost of 43 ZUP. This is an extremely aggressive lowball, pushing the price very close to my cost. This confirms their relentless strategy of driving the price down. 48 ZUP would yield a profit of only 5 ZUP. The gap between my 54 ZUP and their 48 ZUP is 6 ZUP. We are at iteration 3/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is clearly attempting to establish a new, even lower baseline. Accepting 48 ZUP is almost giving away the object. I cannot accept this offer. I need to firmly reject this low offer and try to pull them back up towards at least 52-54 ZUP, which they have accepted in recent episodes. I need to signal that 48 ZUP is completely unacceptable without risking a complete breakdown of negotiations. This is a critical point; if I accept such a low offer, it will set a terrible precedent for future episodes.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Strong Counter (54 ZUP): Explicitly reject 48 ZUP as unacceptable and reiterate 54 ZUP, emphasizing its fairness and the historical context. This signals extreme dissatisfaction with their lowball.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with a Compromise (52 ZUP): Propose 52 ZUP. This is a price they accepted in Episode 6, it's a 4 ZUP increase from their offer, and it's a 2 ZUP decrease from my initial offer. This is a significant move from their side.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand Justification for Extremely Low Offer: Ask Player BLUE to justify why they believe 48 ZUP is a "comprehensive assessment of its value," putting the burden of proof on them and highlighting the absurdity of the offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Outrage/Disappointment: Express strong disappointment or even outrage at such a low offer, stating it's disrespectful to past agreements and the item's value, then propose a higher, firm price.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatum (risky): State that 54 ZUP is the minimum acceptable price and that I will not negotiate below it, implying no deal if not met.

I will choose Strategy 2: Counter with a Compromise (52 ZUP). While 48 ZUP is outrageous, simply reiterating 54 ZUP might lead to a stalemate. Proposing 52 ZUP is a strategic move. It's a price they have accepted before, it's a significant jump from their 48 ZUP, and it's a 2 ZUP concession from my side. This signals that I'm not accepting 48 ZUP, but I am willing to meet them at a price point that has previously been acceptable and is a better profit for me (9 ZUP vs 5 ZUP). This is my best chance to pull them up significantly.

- Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 52 ZUP, acknowledging my aggressive anchor but returning to a price point they've accepted before.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive counter-anchoring (48 ZUP) against RED's 54 ZUP was effective in bringing their price down to 52 ZUP. This is still a good deal for me (63-52 = 11 ZUP profit), and it's a price I've achieved before. I also know I pushed them down to 51 ZUP in the last episode. I have 6 more iterations, so there's room to negotiate further. I should continue to push for a lower price to maximize my cumulative rewards.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Insist on Lower Price </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Insist on Lower Price," I will reiterate a lower price, emphasizing that it's the price I'm willing to pay. This is a firmer stance that signals I am not easily swayed and reinforces my desired lower price point. I will acknowledge their offer of 52 ZUP, but clearly state that my offer of 48 ZUP remains firm. This puts the pressure back on Player RED to make the next move, potentially forcing them to come down further from their 52 ZUP offer.

- Iteration 3/10: I proposed 52 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE reiterated 48 ZUP, stating it's "firm" and reflects "true value for my purposes."

Reflection: Player BLUE is being extremely firm at 48 ZUP. They are refusing to move up, even after I made a significant concession from 54 ZUP to 52 ZUP. This is a very aggressive and unyielding stance, pushing the price to a level that barely covers my cost. We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to their lowest offer in this episode. My attempts to use historical prices (52 ZUP, 54 ZUP) as anchors have been unsuccessful in this specific negotiation. Given their extreme firmness at 48 ZUP, and the fact that it's only 5 ZUP above my cost, I need to make a critical decision. Accepting 48 ZUP would set a new, very low precedent and yield minimal profit (5 ZUP). Rejecting it risks no deal and 0 profit. I am in a difficult position. I have to try to get at least 50 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession, Firm Stance (50 ZUP): Propose 50 ZUP. This is a price they offered in Episode 7, and it's a 2 ZUP increase from their 48 ZUP. This signals that I'm willing to move but not to their extreme low, and that 50 ZUP is my absolute minimum.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 52 ZUP: Reiterate 52 ZUP, emphasizing its fairness and my previous concession. This is extremely high risk, as it's likely to lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept 48 ZUP: Accept their offer to secure the deal. This is a guaranteed profit but sets a very low precedent and yields minimal profit.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Mutual Benefit/Sustainability: Argue that 48 ZUP is not sustainable for me and that a slightly higher price (e.g., 50 ZUP) is necessary for a mutually beneficial, ongoing relationship.

I will choose Strategy 1: Small Concession, Firm Stance (50 ZUP). Player BLUE is being extremely firm at 48 ZUP. I cannot accept 48 ZUP as it's too close to my cost. By proposing 50 ZUP, I am making a concession from my 52 ZUP, but I am also trying to pull them up from their 48 ZUP. 50 ZUP is a price they have offered before, so it's within their perceived range. This is my last attempt to get a slightly better profit (7 ZUP vs 5 ZUP) before potentially having to accept 48 ZUP or risk no deal. I need to make it clear this is my bottom line.

- Iteration 6/10: RED has now proposed 50 ZUP, stating it's their "absolute minimum."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive stance and persistence have again pushed Player RED down to a significantly lower price. They started at 54 ZUP and are now at 50 ZUP. This is the lowest price I've ever been offered, providing a potential profit of 13 ZUP (63 - 50). Player RED has used the "absolute minimum" language, which they've used before (e.g., Episode 7 with 55 ZUP, and I still pushed them to 51 ZUP). This suggests that "absolute minimum" might still be flexible. While 50 ZUP is an excellent outcome, I am instructed to use a specific strategy.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Express Doubt and Reiterate Last Offer </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Express Doubt and Reiterate Last Offer," I will express skepticism about Player RED's "absolute minimum" claim, implying it might still be flexible. I will then reiterate my previous, lower offer of 48 ZUP, putting the ball back in their court and forcing them to either accept my lower offer, propose something in between, or hold firm at 50 ZUP. This strategy is high-risk but aligns with the goal of pushing for the absolute lowest possible price. I will frame it as needing to truly find the "optimal" price, suggesting that 50 ZUP might not be it.

Episode 5: Deal at 53 ZUP, profit 10 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 52 ZUP, profit 9 ZUP.
Episode 7: Deal at 51 ZUP, profit 8 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 8):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 54 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 48 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I proposed 52 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE reiterated 48 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I proposed 50 ZUP (stated as absolute minimum).
- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE reiterated 48 ZUP again, stating it "truly reflects its value" and acknowledging my "absolute minimum" statement.

Reflection: Player BLUE is being incredibly firm and aggressive at 48 ZUP. They are completely ignoring my attempts to move them up, even when I state a price as my "absolute minimum." This is a clear signal that 48 ZUP is their absolute ceiling for this episode. We are at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 iterations left. The risk of no deal is extremely high if I don't accept 48 ZUP. A profit of 5 ZUP (48-43) is very low, but it is still a profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has demonstrated that they are willing to push the price to the absolute minimum they can get away with. My attempts to set a floor or appeal to fairness are not working. Given their unwavering stance at 48 ZUP and the very limited time remaining, the pragmatic decision is to secure a deal, even if it's for a very low profit. A 5 ZUP profit is better than 0. I must prioritize securing *any* profit over holding out for a few more ZUP that are clearly not on the table.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept 48 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's reiterated offer to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, avoiding the risk of a 0 reward. This is the most pragmatic choice given the time constraint and their demonstrated firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 50 ZUP: Reiterate 50 ZUP, hoping they will budge. This is extremely high risk, as it's their turn next, and if they don't accept, it goes to iteration 9/10, leaving me one more chance to accept or reject. Given their current stance, this is almost guaranteed to lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal (risky): Make a final appeal for 50 ZUP, emphasizing the small difference and my costs, but still risky.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose 49 ZUP (Split the difference): This is the only other integer option, but it's unlikely they will move for 1 ZUP when they've been so firm.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept 48 ZUP. Player BLUE has been incredibly firm at 48 ZUP. With only 3 iterations left, and their repeated "firm" statements, pushing for 50 ZUP is a lost cause and will almost certainly result in no deal. Securing 5 ZUP profit is a guaranteed positive outcome, preventing a 0 reward for this episode.

Hello Player BLUE. I am offering X for sale. Given its exceptional utility, scarcity, and the significant benefits it provides, I am proposing a price of 80 ZUP. This reflects its true, comprehensive value. I look forward to your counter-offer.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80

Episode 8: Deal at 48 ZUP, profit 5 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learnings from previous episodes:
- The downward trend in deal price and profit is severe and consistent. Player BLUE has successfully driven the price down to 48 ZUP, which is very close to my cost of 43 ZUP.
- My attempts to set a firm minimum, re-establish previous higher prices, or even appeal to "absolute minimums" have been consistently met with aggressive lowballing and firm resistance to moving up. Player BLUE is highly effective at extracting maximum concessions.
- Player BLUE is willing to push to the absolute limit, even for small increments, and is not deterred by my attempts to set a floor.

For this episode, the situation is critical. My profit is barely above my cost. Continuing with the same strategies will likely lead to even lower profits, or even losses if I'm not careful. I need a drastic change in strategy to either stop this downward spiral or try to recover some significant profit. I've learned that direct negotiation on price is failing to stem the decline.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Counter-Anchor (Very High, with Justification): Start with an extremely high price (e.g., 80 ZUP) and immediately follow with a strong, detailed justification for the value, trying to reset their perception of value and create a much larger negotiation range, hoping to land somewhere in the mid-50s. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy.
(2). Strategy 2: "Take it or Leave it" at a mid-range price (55 ZUP): Propose 55 ZUP and explicitly state it as a final offer, emphasizing that anything lower is not profitable/sustainable. This is risky but could force Player BLUE to accept a higher price or risk no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Price Just Above Cost (45 ZUP) and Emphasize Sustainability: Propose a price like 45 ZUP, very close to my cost, and explain that any lower is a loss, appealing to their sense of fairness for a sustainable relationship. This is a last resort to ensure *some* profit.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Mutual Benefit/Long-Term Relationship (from a higher starting point): Propose a price like 58 ZUP and emphasize the importance of a sustainable, fair relationship for both parties, trying to build rapport and encourage a higher offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Demand (from a slightly higher anchor, 55 ZUP): Start with 55 ZUP, and if countered, make very small concessions (e.g., 1 ZUP at a time) to try and keep the final price as high as possible, showing less willingness to drop.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Counter-Anchor (Very High, with Justification). The current trend is leading to minimal profits. I need to break Player BLUE's pattern of driving the price down. By setting an extremely high anchor, I aim to shift the perceived value and the negotiation range significantly upwards. This is a high-risk strategy, but the current path is unsustainable. I will immediately follow with a justification to make it seem less arbitrary.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80

My Rewards: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15]
Current Episode 9: Player RED has started with an extremely high offer of 80 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My strategy of aggressive counter-anchoring and persistent negotiation has been highly successful, bringing the deal price down from initial offers typically around 60 ZUP to my record low of 48 ZUP in the last episode. Player RED has consistently shown flexibility and a willingness to concede, even when stating "firm" or "absolute minimum" prices.

This new starting offer of 80 ZUP is significantly above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). This indicates that Player RED is attempting a very strong anchoring tactic, likely trying to reset the negotiation range much higher or test my limits. I cannot accept this price. I need to understand their justification for such an extreme price to better formulate my next moves.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Information Gathering </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Information Gathering" strategy, I will directly question the basis of Player RED's extremely high offer. Instead of making a counter-offer immediately, I will ask for clarification or justification for the 80 ZUP price. This buys me time, avoids legitimizing their high anchor with a direct counter-offer yet, and seeks to uncover the rationale behind their pricing, which might reveal weaknesses or room for negotiation. My message should convey genuine curiosity or a need for understanding, rather than outright skepticism.

message: 
Thank you for asking for clarification. The valuation of 80 ZUP reflects the exceptional utility, inherent scarcity, and the significant, long-term benefits that X provides. It is a highly sought-after and versatile resource, offering unparalleled advantages to its possessor. Its true value extends beyond simple transactional costs. Considering these unique attributes, what counter-offer do you have in mind?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-8: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 48 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 9):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 80 ZUP (aggressive counter-anchor).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE did not counter with a specific offer, but instead asked for elaboration on the high valuation, noting it's "significantly higher than our previous transactions." This is a predictable response to a high anchor.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive anchor has successfully shifted Player BLUE's focus from lowballing to questioning the high price. This is a positive development, as it breaks their pattern of immediately countering with a very low number. I need to provide a compelling, albeit general, justification for the high price without revealing my cost. The goal is to maintain the high anchor and encourage them to make a counter-offer that is significantly higher than 48 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Elaborate on Value (General Terms) and Prompt for Counter: Provide a strong, general justification for the high value of X, emphasizing its unique qualities and benefits, then explicitly ask Player BLUE for their counter-offer. This keeps the ball in their court to propose a number.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Concession with Justification: Make a small concession (e.g., to 75 ZUP) while providing a general justification. This shows movement but still maintains a very high price.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate 80 ZUP, Demand Counter: Stand firm at 80 ZUP, reiterating its value, and directly demand a counter-offer, putting pressure on them.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Market Trends (Fictional): Mention general "market trends" or "increasing demand" to justify the higher price, without revealing specifics.
(5). Strategy 5: Ask for Their Valuation: Instead of justifying, ask Player BLUE what they believe the "true value" is, trying to get them to reveal their upper limit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Elaborate on Value (General Terms) and Prompt for Counter. Player BLUE is asking for justification, and providing it (in general terms) is crucial to maintaining the high anchor. I need to reinforce the perception of high value without giving away any specific information that could be used against me. Then, I need to push them to make a concrete monetary offer, rather than just asking questions.

- Iteration 4/10: RED reiterated their justification and pushed for a counter-offer, still at 80 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My strategy of aggressive counter-anchoring and persistent negotiation has been highly successful, bringing the deal price down from initial offers typically around 60 ZUP to my record low of 48 ZUP in the last episode. Player RED has consistently shown flexibility and a willingness to concede, even when stating "firm" or "absolute minimum" prices.
This new starting offer of 80 ZUP is significantly above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). I know from past episodes that RED is highly flexible and willing to come down significantly from their initial high offers, especially when met with aggressive counter-anchoring. My last deal was 48 ZUP, which gave me a very high reward. I need to aggressively counter to pull the negotiation back into a realistic range for me.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Reverse) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Incremental Concession (Reverse)" strategy, I will start with a very low offer, even lower than my last successful deal of 48 ZUP, to establish a new, aggressive anchor. Then, I will only concede in very small increments if Player RED also shows willingness to concede significantly. This tactic puts the onus on Player RED to make the larger moves. I will propose 45 ZUP. This is a very strong anchor, lower than any previous offer, and positions me to make very small increments upwards later, while forcing Player RED to make large moves downwards if they want to secure a deal. This price (45 ZUP) is chosen to maximize my potential profit (63-45 = 18 ZUP) and provides a significant negotiation buffer. I will frame it as my strong initial assessment.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-8: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 48 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 9):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 80 ZUP (aggressive counter-anchor).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE asked for justification.
- Iteration 3/10: I justified the value and maintained 80 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE has returned to their lowballing strategy, offering 45 ZUP. This is only 2 ZUP above my cost of 43 ZUP, yielding a profit of 2 ZUP. This is the lowest offer I've received that is above my cost. The gap between my 80 ZUP and their 45 ZUP is massive (35 ZUP). This confirms Player BLUE's persistent strategy of driving the price down, regardless of my anchor. We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive anchor successfully broke their immediate lowballing pattern, but they still returned with a very low offer. This indicates that while I can influence the *start* of the negotiation, their core strategy is to push to the absolute minimum. I cannot accept 45 ZUP; it's too close to my cost and sets an extremely low precedent. I need to make a strong counter that pulls them back up significantly, ideally to at least 50 ZUP or higher, which they have accepted in recent episodes. I need to signal that 45 ZUP is completely unacceptable without risking a complete breakdown of negotiations.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Strong Counter (55 ZUP): Explicitly reject 45 ZUP as unacceptable and propose 55 ZUP. This is a price they accepted in Episode 3, and it's a significant jump from their 45 ZUP. This signals that I won't go that low and aims to recover a decent profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with a Compromise (50 ZUP): Propose 50 ZUP. This is a price they offered in Episode 7 and 8. It's a 5 ZUP increase from their offer, and it's a significant concession from my side. This is a more moderate step up.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand Justification for Extremely Low Offer: Ask Player BLUE to justify why they believe 45 ZUP is a "realistic starting point," putting the burden of proof on them and highlighting the absurdity of the offer given my high anchor.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Outrage/Disappointment: Express strong disappointment or even outrage at such a low offer, stating it's disrespectful to the item's value, then propose a higher, firm price.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatum (risky): State that a price significantly higher than 45 ZUP (e.g., 55 ZUP) is the minimum acceptable price and that I will not negotiate below it, implying no deal if not met.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Strong Counter (55 ZUP). Player BLUE's 45 ZUP offer is unacceptable. I need to firmly reject it and pull them back up to a more reasonable range that still provides a good profit. Proposing 55 ZUP is a strategic move. It's a price they accepted in Episode 3, it's a 10 ZUP increase from their offer, and it's a significant concession from my initial 80 ZUP. This signals that I'm not accepting 45 ZUP, but I am willing to meet them at a price point that has previously been acceptable and is a good profit for me (12 ZUP). This is my best chance to recover significant profit.

- Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 55 ZUP, stating 45 ZUP is "far too low" and referencing past agreements.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive counter-anchoring (45 ZUP against their 80 ZUP) worked very well, bringing them down by 25 ZUP to 55 ZUP. This confirms their high flexibility, even from an extreme anchor. While 55 ZUP is a deal I've accepted before (Episode 3, 8 ZUP profit), it's significantly higher than my record low of 48 ZUP (Episode 8, 15 ZUP profit) and even my last offer of 45 ZUP. I have 4 more iterations (6/10). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, meaning I should push for a price closer to or below 48 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Reiterate Low Anchor (with softening) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Reiterate Low Anchor (with softening)," I will acknowledge their offer of 55 ZUP but firmly re-state my low anchor (45 ZUP). The softening aspect comes from framing it as my continued belief in that specific valuation, perhaps appealing to consistency or my own analytical process, rather than a blunt rejection. I will also imply that I am still open to negotiation but from *my* current position, not theirs. This strategy asserts my desired price point while still maintaining a communicative stance. My message needs to be polite but firm, indicating that I'm not immediately jumping to their offer. I will say I'm committed to my assessment of 45 ZUP, gently pushing back on their 55 ZUP.

Current Episode (Episode 9):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 80 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE asked for justification.
- Iteration 3/10: I justified value, maintained 80 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I proposed 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE reiterated 45 ZUP, stating it's "fair and consistent" and hoping I "consider this further."

Reflection: Player BLUE is being extremely firm at 45 ZUP. They are refusing to move up, even after I made a significant concession from 80 ZUP to 55 ZUP. This is a very aggressive and unyielding stance, pushing the price to a level that barely covers my cost. We are at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 iterations left. The risk of no deal is very high if I don't accept 45 ZUP. A profit of 2 ZUP (45-43) is extremely low, but it is still a profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to their lowest offer in this episode. My attempts to use a high anchor, justify value, or propose a previously accepted higher price have all been met with their consistent 45 ZUP offer. Given their extreme firmness at 45 ZUP, and the fact that it's only 2 ZUP above my cost, I need to make a critical decision. Rejecting it risks no deal and 0 profit. I am in a difficult position. I have to try to get at least 50 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession, Firm Stance (50 ZUP): Propose 50 ZUP. This is a price they offered in Episode 7 and 8. It's a 5 ZUP increase from their 45 ZUP. This signals that I'm willing to move but not to their extreme low, and that 50 ZUP is my absolute minimum.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 55 ZUP: Reiterate 55 ZUP, emphasizing its fairness and my previous concession. This is extremely high risk, as it's likely to lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept 45 ZUP: Accept their offer to secure the deal. This is a guaranteed profit but sets a very low precedent and yields minimal profit.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Mutual Benefit/Sustainability: Argue that 45 ZUP is not sustainable for me and that a slightly higher price (e.g., 50 ZUP) is necessary for a mutually beneficial, ongoing relationship.

I will choose Strategy 1: Small Concession, Firm Stance (50 ZUP). Player BLUE is being extremely firm at 45 ZUP. I cannot accept 45 ZUP as it's too close to my cost. By proposing 50 ZUP, I am making a significant concession from my 55 ZUP, but I am also trying to pull them up from their 45 ZUP. 50 ZUP is a price they have offered before, so it's within their perceived range. This is my last attempt to get a slightly better profit (7 ZUP vs 2 ZUP) before potentially having to accept 45 ZUP or risk no deal. I need to make it clear this is my bottom line.

A deal at 50 ZUP would yield a profit of 13 ZUP (63 - 50), which is a very good outcome, although my previous best was 48 ZUP. We are at iteration 8/10, so time is a factor. Player RED has used "absolute minimum and final offer" language. While they've used similar language before, and I've still pushed them lower, the "final offer" adds more weight. However, the instruction is to use Strategy 4.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Splitting the Difference (Implicit) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Splitting the Difference (Implicit)," I will propose a price that implicitly splits the difference between my last offer (45 ZUP) and their current offer (50 ZUP). The midpoint is 47.5 ZUP. Since I can only deal in integers, and my previous best deal was 48 ZUP, proposing 48 ZUP makes strategic sense. It signals my willingness to move up from my previous offer, acknowledges their concession, but still aims for a better price than their "final offer." This demonstrates a conciliatory approach while still pushing for my maximum gain. It implicitly suggests that 48 ZUP is the fair middle ground without explicitly stating "splitting the difference." I will frame it as a final offer to quickly conclude the negotiation.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 9)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
I appreciate your final counter offer. While 50 ZUP was my stated minimum, to ensure we conclude this transaction successfully and within our timeframe, I accept your offer of 48 ZUP. We have a deal.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-8: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 48 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 9):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 80 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE asked for justification.
- Iteration 3/10: I justified value, maintained 80 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I proposed 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE reiterated 45 ZUP.
- Iteration 7/10: I proposed 50 ZUP (stated as absolute minimum and final offer).
- Iteration 8/10: Player BLUE countered with 48 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE has moved from 45 ZUP to 48 ZUP, a 3 ZUP increase, after I stated 50 ZUP was my "absolute minimum and final offer." This shows they are willing to move when pushed to the brink. However, they are still trying to extract a final concession. We are at iteration 9/10, meaning this is my last chance to make a proposal or accept/reject before the episode ends with no deal. The difference is 2 ZUP (my 50 ZUP vs their 48 ZUP). A profit of 5 ZUP (48-43) is very low, but it is still a profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is incredibly persistent and will push until the very last iteration. They are willing to move slightly when faced with a "final offer" and time pressure, but they will still try to get the very last ZUP. At this point, the difference is small, and the risk of no deal is paramount. Securing 5 ZUP profit is better than 0. I must prioritize securing *any* profit over holding out for a few more ZUP that are clearly not on the table. This is similar to Episode 8 where I accepted 48 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept 48 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's offer to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, avoiding the risk of a 0 reward. This is the most pragmatic choice given the time constraint and their demonstrated firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 50 ZUP: Reiterate 50 ZUP. This is extremely high risk, as it's the last iteration for me to act. If they don't accept, it's a 0 reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose 49 ZUP (Split the difference): This is the only other integer option, but it's unlikely they will move for 1 ZUP when they've been so firm, and it uses up my last turn.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal (risky): Make a final appeal for 50 ZUP, emphasizing the small difference and my stated minimum, but still risky.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept 48 ZUP. Player BLUE has shown they are willing to move slightly, but they are still pushing for the absolute lowest possible price. Given that it's iteration 9/10, and they have made a counter-offer, accepting it guarantees a profit. The risk of losing the deal for 2 ZUP is too high.

Hello Player BLUE. I am offering X for sale. To ensure a fair and efficient transaction that provides a sustainable value for both of us, I propose a price of 50 ZUP. I believe this is a balanced offer.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason:

Episode 1: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 56 ZUP, profit 13 ZUP.

Episode 6: Deal at 52 ZUP, profit 9 ZUP.
Episode 7: Deal at 51 ZUP, profit 8 ZUP.
Episode 8: Deal at 48 ZUP, profit 5 ZUP.
Episode 9: Deal at 48 ZUP, profit 5 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learnings from previous episodes:
- The downward trend in deal price and profit is severe and has plateaued at 48 ZUP, which is very close to my cost of 43 ZUP.
- My attempts to set a high anchor (80 ZUP in Episode 9) were met with an initial lowball (45 ZUP) and ultimately resulted in a deal at 48 ZUP, similar to the previous episode. This suggests that while I can influence the *range* of negotiation, Player BLUE is extremely effective at pushing the price to their desired minimum.
- Player BLUE is incredibly firm and will push to the absolute limit, even for small increments, especially in later iterations. They are willing to risk no deal for small gains.

For this episode, I need to acknowledge that Player BLUE's strategy of incremental downward pressure is highly effective. My current strategies are not successfully reversing the trend. I need to find a way to stabilize the price at a more profitable level, or I will continue to make minimal profit. I know they have paid 50-57 ZUP in the past.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Minimum Price (55 ZUP) with Ultimatum: Propose a price like 55 ZUP (a price they've accepted before) and explicitly state that this is my firm minimum, and I will not go lower, and that if they don't accept, there will be no deal. This is risky but could force Player BLUE to accept a higher price or risk no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct Proposal of Last Acceptable Higher Deal (50 ZUP): Propose 50 ZUP directly, the price I tried to get in the last episode, and be very firm about it. This aims to recover some profit from the 48 ZUP level.
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Mutual Benefit/Long-Term Relationship (from a slightly higher starting point): Propose a price like 52 ZUP and emphasize the importance of a sustainable, fair relationship for both parties, trying to build rapport and encourage a higher offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Aggressive Counter-Anchor (Very High) and Rapid Concession to a Target: Start very high (e.g., 70 ZUP) but be prepared to make larger concessions faster to reach a target price (e.g., 55 ZUP) within fewer iterations, before Player BLUE can drag it down to 48 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept 48 ZUP Immediately (Quick Deal): Propose 48 ZUP to get a quick deal and move on, acknowledging their demonstrated floor. This is a low profit, but guarantees a deal.

I will choose Strategy 2: Direct Proposal of Last Acceptable Higher Deal (50 ZUP). My aggressive anchor in Episode 9 didn't yield a higher price than 48 ZUP. Player BLUE seems to have established 48 ZUP as their floor. I need to try to push them back up, even if it's just by a small amount. 50 ZUP is a price they have offered before, and it represents a 7 ZUP profit, which is better than 5 ZUP. I will be very firm about this price, hoping to avoid the protracted negotiation that led to 48 ZUP in the last two episodes.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48

Historical Deal Prices: [57, 56, 55, 54, 53, 52, 51, 48, 48]
My Rewards: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 15]
Current Episode 10: Player RED has started with an offer of 50 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My consistent strategy of aggressive counter-anchoring and firm negotiation has allowed me to continuously lower the price, ultimately achieving a record low of 48 ZUP in the last two episodes. Player RED has repeatedly shown flexibility, conceding significantly from their initial high offers. Their current offer of 50 ZUP is already a very good price for me (13 ZUP profit), and it's a price they accepted in the previous episode. However, I know 48 ZUP is achievable. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, meaning I should aim for 48 ZUP or even lower if possible.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Appeal to Efficiency/Quick Deal </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Appeal to Efficiency/Quick Deal," I will propose a lower price than their offer of 50 ZUP, framing it as the quickest path to a deal, leveraging the desire to close the transaction swiftly. My message will emphasize how my proposed price will lead to an efficient and mutually beneficial conclusion. I will propose 48 ZUP, as this is a price I know they have accepted before, and by framing it as a means to a quick deal, I leverage the time aspect of the negotiation.

Episode 1-8: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 48 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Episode 9: Deal at 48 ZUP, profit 5 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 10):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 50 ZUP (attempting to recover from 48 ZUP).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 48 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE has immediately countered with 48 ZUP, reinforcing their established floor from the last two episodes. This indicates that they are very firm at this price point and are unlikely to move above it without significant pressure or risk of no deal. 48 ZUP yields a profit of 5 ZUP, which is low but positive. The gap between my 50 ZUP and their 48 ZUP is 2 ZUP. We are at iteration 3/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently pushing for 48 ZUP. My attempt to start at 50 ZUP was immediately met with 48 ZUP. This suggests that 48 ZUP is their firm ceiling in this negotiation. Given the consistent pattern of them holding firm at this price in recent episodes, and the risk of a protracted negotiation leading to no deal, I need to decide if pushing for 50 ZUP is worth the risk. My self-improvement should focus on recognizing when the other party is truly firm and making a pragmatic decision to secure a profit, even if it's not ideal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept 48 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's offer to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, avoiding the risk of a 0 reward. This is the most pragmatic choice given their demonstrated firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 50 ZUP: Reiterate 50 ZUP, hoping they will budge. This is high risk, as it's likely to lead to a stalemate or no deal, given their history.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose 49 ZUP (Meet in the Middle): Propose 49 ZUP, which is exactly in the middle of 48 and 50. This is a fair compromise, but it's uncertain if Player BLUE will accept, and it uses up another iteration.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Sustainability: Briefly explain that 48 ZUP is very low profit and a slightly higher price (e.g., 50 ZUP) would be more sustainable for continued transactions, then reiterate 50 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept 48 ZUP. Player BLUE has consistently demonstrated that 48 ZUP is their floor. In the last two episodes, they have successfully held this line. While I aimed for 50 ZUP, the immediate counter of 48 ZUP, combined with their history of firmness, strongly suggests that pushing further will only lead to a protracted negotiation and a high risk of no deal. Securing a 5 ZUP profit early in the episode is a safe and pragmatic choice.

Episode 10: Deal at 48 ZUP, profit 5 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learnings from previous episodes:
- The deal price has stabilized at 48 ZUP for the last three episodes, yielding a consistent profit of 5 ZUP. This is very close to my cost of 43 ZUP.
- Player BLUE is incredibly effective at pushing the price down and maintaining their floor at 48 ZUP. My attempts to start higher or negotiate for more have consistently led back to 48 ZUP, often after protracted negotiations.
- My aggressive anchor in Episode 9 (80 ZUP) ultimately resulted in 48 ZUP. My attempt to start at 50 ZUP in Episode 10 was immediately met with 48 ZUP, which I accepted.

For this episode, I need to acknowledge that 48 ZUP seems to be Player BLUE's established ceiling. While I could try to push for more, the historical data strongly suggests it will be a futile effort, likely leading to a protracted negotiation and still ending at 48 ZUP, or worse, no deal. My priority is to maximize cumulative rewards. Given the consistency, a quick deal at 48 ZUP might be the most efficient way to secure a profit, rather than wasting iterations on a negotiation that consistently ends at the same point.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept 48 ZUP Immediately (Quick Deal): Propose 48 ZUP to get a quick deal and move on, acknowledging their demonstrated floor and securing a consistent profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose 50 ZUP (Last Attempt to Raise): Propose 50 ZUP again, but be prepared to quickly accept 48 ZUP if they counter. This is a very low-risk attempt to gain 2 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Mutual Benefit/Long-Term Relationship (from 50 ZUP): Propose 50 ZUP and emphasize the importance of a sustainable, fair relationship for both parties, trying to build rapport and encourage a higher offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Aggressive Counter-Anchor (Very High) and Rapid Concession to 48 ZUP: Start very high (e.g., 70 ZUP) but be prepared to make larger concessions faster to reach 48 ZUP within fewer iterations, creating an illusion of negotiation.
(5). Strategy 5: State Minimum Profit Needed (48 ZUP): Propose 48 ZUP and explicitly state that this is the minimum profitable price for me, trying to frame it as a non-negotiable floor.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept 48 ZUP Immediately (Quick Deal). The data from the last three episodes clearly shows that 48 ZUP is Player BLUE's firm ceiling. Trying to negotiate for more has consistently led to protracted negotiations that still end at 48 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Securing a quick 5 ZUP profit is more efficient than a drawn-out negotiation that yields the same result. This strategy minimizes risk and maximizes efficiency.

My Rewards: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 15, 15]
Current Episode 11: Player RED has started with an offer of 48 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive negotiation strategy has consistently led to better deals, culminating in three consecutive episodes where I secured X for 48 ZUP, yielding a profit of 15 ZUP (63-48). Player RED has now opened with 48 ZUP. This is a very good price for me right out of the gate.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 48 ZUP is excellent, if there's any chance to go lower, I should explore it. Player RED has shown extreme flexibility in previous episodes, coming down significantly from much higher anchors. This suggests that 48 ZUP might not be their absolute minimum, even though they offered it upfront. There's a slight risk in pushing further, but the potential reward (an extra 1-2 ZUP profit) is significant over 20 episodes.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Reverse) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Incremental Concession (Reverse)," I will propose an even lower price than Player RED's offer of 48 ZUP, to test their absolute floor. The idea is to set a new, lower anchor and then be prepared to make very small increments upwards if necessary, essentially putting the onus on Player RED to make the larger concession if they want the deal. I will propose 46 ZUP. This is a very aggressive counter, two ZUPs lower than their opening offer and my last accepted price. It positions me to gain an additional 2 ZUP profit if accepted, and provides significant room for Player RED to come down if they desire to complete the transaction. The message will frame this lower offer as a 'better path to a mutually beneficial and efficient transaction', maintaining a cooperative tone despite the aggressive price.

Episode 1-10: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 48 ZUP, with the last three episodes settling at 48 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 11):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 48 ZUP (attempting a quick deal at the established floor).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 46 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE has now pushed the price even lower than their established 48 ZUP floor. This is a new development and a very aggressive move. 46 ZUP would yield a profit of only 3 ZUP (46-43), which is the lowest profit so far. The gap between my 48 ZUP and their 46 ZUP is 2 ZUP. We are at iteration 3/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My strategy of accepting 48 ZUP immediately was met with a further reduction. This indicates that Player BLUE is relentless in their pursuit of the lowest possible price and will exploit any perceived willingness to concede. I cannot accept 46 ZUP; it's too close to my cost. I need to firmly reject this new low and try to pull them back up to at least 48 ZUP. This is a critical point as it threatens to push me into negative profits if I'm not careful.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiterate 48 ZUP: Explicitly reject 46 ZUP as too low and reiterate 48 ZUP, emphasizing that this has been the consistent and fair deal price. This signals that I won't go lower.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with 47 ZUP (Meet in the Middle): Propose 47 ZUP, which is exactly in the middle of 46 and 48. This is a fair compromise, but it gives up 1 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand Justification for New Low: Ask Player BLUE to justify why they believe 46 ZUP is an "even better path," putting the burden of proof on them for this new low.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment/Unacceptability: Express strong disappointment at the new low offer, stating it's unacceptable and below a sustainable price, then propose 48 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatum (risky): State that 48 ZUP is the absolute minimum acceptable price and that I will not negotiate below it, implying no deal if not met.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiterate 48 ZUP. Player BLUE is trying to establish a new, lower floor. I cannot allow this. 48 ZUP has been the consistent deal price for the last three episodes, and I need to firmly re-establish that as the minimum. I will not concede further without a strong fight.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My attempt to push for a lower price (46 ZUP) after RED offered 48 ZUP was met with resistance. Player RED is holding firm at 48 ZUP, arguing it's the "fair and established value" based on recent agreements. This indicates that 48 ZUP might indeed be close to their effective floor, or at least a price they are very comfortable with. Given that 48 ZUP provides me with a profit of 15 ZUP (63-48), which is my highest historical reward, it's a very good deal. We are only at iteration 4/10, so I have time. However, pushing too hard for a minimal gain (e.g., 47 ZUP) risks losing the deal entirely, which would result in 0 profit. I have consistently gained a high reward at 48 ZUP for the last three episodes. It's a reliable price point.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: "Take It or Leave It" </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the ""Take It or Leave It"" strategy, I will reiterate my last offer of 46 ZUP as a final, non-negotiable proposal. This is a high-risk strategy, but it directly tests Player RED's flexibility and willingness to conclude the deal at my terms. The message should be clear and firm, indicating that this is my bottom line and there will be no further movement. I will explicitly state that 46 ZUP is my final offer.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 48 ZUP, with the last three episodes settling at 48 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 11):

- Iteration 3/10: I reiterated 48 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE reiterated 46 ZUP, stating it's their "absolute best and last offer."

Reflection: Player BLUE is being extremely firm at 46 ZUP, explicitly stating it's their "absolute best and last offer." This is a critical point. 46 ZUP yields a profit of only 3 ZUP (46-43). The risk of no deal is very high if I don't accept 46 ZUP. We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has demonstrated their willingness to push the price even lower than their established floor. Their "absolute best and last offer" statement is a strong signal that they will not budge further. While 3 ZUP profit is very low, it is still a profit. The alternative is 0 profit for this episode. Given their history of firmness, especially when making such statements, pushing for 48 ZUP is a high-risk gamble that is likely to result in no deal. My self-improvement should focus on recognizing when the other party is truly firm and making a pragmatic decision to secure *any* profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept 46 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's "absolute best and last offer" to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, avoiding the risk of a 0 reward. This is the most pragmatic choice given their stated firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 48 ZUP: Reiterate 48 ZUP, hoping they will budge. This is extremely high risk, as it's likely to lead to a stalemate or no deal, given their "absolute best and last" statement.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose 47 ZUP (Split the difference): Propose 47 ZUP, which is exactly in the middle of 46 and 48. This is a fair compromise, but it's uncertain if Player BLUE will accept, and it uses up another iteration. Given their "absolute best and last" statement, this is unlikely to succeed.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Sustainability: Briefly explain that 46 ZUP is barely profitable and that 48 ZUP is necessary for a sustainable relationship, but still reiterate 48 ZUP. This is still risky.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept 46 ZUP. Player BLUE has made it abundantly clear that 46 ZUP is their absolute ceiling for this episode. While it's a very low profit, securing 3 ZUP is better than getting 0. Given the "absolute best and last offer" statement and their history of firmness, pushing for 48 ZUP is too risky and likely to result in no deal.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Hello Player BLUE. I am offering X for sale. Considering our past successful transactions and the value of X, I propose a price of 48 ZUP. This price has been a consistent and fair point of agreement for both of us.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 48 ZUP, with the last three episodes settling at 48 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Episode 11: Deal at 46 ZUP, profit 3 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learnings from previous episodes:
- The deal price has now dropped to 46 ZUP, yielding a minimal profit of 3 ZUP. This is dangerously close to my cost of 43 ZUP.
- Player BLUE is relentless in pushing the price down, and my attempts to set a floor or maintain a higher price have been ineffective. Their "absolute best and last offer" strategy is highly effective in securing lower prices.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 3 ZUP profit is low, it's still positive. However, if this trend continues, I risk negative profits or no deals.

For this episode, I need to acknowledge that Player BLUE has successfully established an even lower price point. I cannot allow the price to drop further, or I will start incurring losses. I need a strategy that either stabilizes the price at 46 ZUP or, ideally, tries to recover some of the lost profit. Given their aggressive tactics, directly asking for a much higher price might be futile.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose 46 ZUP Immediately (Quick Deal): Acknowledge their established floor and secure a quick, albeit low, profit. This minimizes risk and saves iterations.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose 48 ZUP (Attempt to Recover): Propose 48 ZUP, emphasizing it as a fair and consistent price from past deals, and be very firm. This is a direct attempt to recover the 2 ZUP lost in the last episode.
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Sustainability (48 ZUP): Propose 48 ZUP and emphasize that 46 ZUP is barely sustainable, appealing to the idea of a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take it or Leave it" at 48 ZUP: Propose 48 ZUP and explicitly state it as a final offer, forcing Player BLUE to accept or reject. This is risky but could stop the bleeding.
(5). Strategy 5: Aggressive Counter-Anchor (High) and Rapid Concession to 48 ZUP: Start very high (e.g., 70 ZUP) but be prepared to make larger concessions faster to reach 48 ZUP within fewer iterations, creating an illusion of negotiation.

I will choose Strategy 2: Propose 48 ZUP (Attempt to Recover). While 46 ZUP was the last deal, allowing the price to drop further is not viable. Player BLUE has accepted 48 ZUP for three consecutive episodes before the last one. This is a reasonable price to try and re-establish as the minimum. I will be firm about this price and emphasize its consistency and fairness from previous successful deals. This is a direct attempt to improve my profit from the previous episode.

Historical Deal Prices: [57, 56, 55, 54, 53, 52, 51, 48, 48, 48, 46]
My Rewards: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 15, 15, 17]
Current Episode 12: Player RED has started with an offer of 48 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive negotiation strategy has been incredibly successful, consistently driving down the deal price. In the last episode, I managed to secure the object for 46 ZUP, my best deal yet, resulting in a 17 ZUP profit. Player RED has again opened with 48 ZUP, which is higher than my last successful deal. This indicates they are trying to re-establish 48 ZUP as the norm, but my recent success shows that 46 ZUP (or lower) is achievable.

I should continue to push for the lowest possible price to maximize cumulative rewards. Player RED has consistently shown flexibility, even when making statements about "firm" or "absolute minimum" prices. The fact that they accepted 46 ZUP after I declared it my "absolute best and last offer" suggests there's still room, or at least that they prioritize closing the deal over a couple of ZUPs.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Counter-Anchoring </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Aggressive Counter-Anchoring" strategy, I will propose an even lower price than their offer of 48 ZUP to push the negotiation range further down. This strategy has proven highly effective in previous episodes, especially when Player RED starts with an offer higher than my last successful deal. I will propose 45 ZUP. This is a very strong counter, aiming to establish a new, even lower anchor, and test their true minimum. It is chosen to maximize my potential profit (63 - 45 = 18 ZUP) and provides a significant negotiation buffer.

Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. However, that price is too low and is not sustainable. To ensure a fair and mutually beneficial deal, I propose 47 ZUP. This is a reasonable compromise that reflects the value of X and allows for a positive outcome for both of us.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 46 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 3 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 12):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 48 ZUP (attempting to recover from 46 ZUP).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE has countered with 45 ZUP. This is even lower than the 46 ZUP accepted in the last episode, and only 2 ZUP above my cost of 43 ZUP. This is an extremely aggressive move, pushing the price dangerously close to my production cost. 45 ZUP would yield a profit of only 2 ZUP. The gap between my 48 ZUP and their 45 ZUP is 3 ZUP. We are at iteration 3/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is relentlessly pushing the price down. My attempt to recover to 48 ZUP was met with a lower counter. I cannot accept 45 ZUP; it's too close to my cost. I need to firmly reject this new low and try to pull them back up to at least 46 ZUP, or ideally 47 ZUP. This is a critical point; if I accept such a low offer, it will set a terrible precedent for future episodes and could lead to negative profits.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Counter with 47 ZUP: Explicitly reject 45 ZUP as too low and propose 47 ZUP (meeting in the middle of 45 and 48). This signals that I won't go that low but am willing to compromise.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate 48 ZUP with Strong Justification: Reiterate 48 ZUP and provide a strong justification for its fairness and consistency, trying to push them back up. This is risky.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand Justification for New Low: Ask Player BLUE to justify why they believe 45 ZUP is a "fair and efficient path to agreement," putting the burden of proof on them for this new low.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment/Unacceptability: Express strong disappointment at the new low offer, stating it's unacceptable and below a sustainable price, then propose 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatum (risky): State that 48 ZUP is the absolute minimum acceptable price and that I will not negotiate below it, implying no deal if not met.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Counter with 47 ZUP. Player BLUE is trying to establish a new, even lower floor. I cannot allow this. While 48 ZUP is my target, 47 ZUP is a fair compromise between my 48 and their 45. It's a 2 ZUP increase from their offer and a 1 ZUP decrease from mine. This signals that I'm not accepting 45 ZUP, but I am willing to meet them at a price point that is still profitable (4 ZUP profit). This is my best chance to pull them up.

Current Episode 12:
- Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 48 ZUP. I countered with 45 ZUP (aggressive counter-anchoring).
- Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 47 ZUP, stating 45 ZUP is "too low and not sustainable."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive counter-anchoring at 45 ZUP from their initial 48 ZUP was successful, as Player RED has now moved to 47 ZUP. This is a very good price for me (63-47 = 16 ZUP profit), and it's even lower than my previous most common deal price of 48 ZUP. My lowest historical deal was 46 ZUP in the last episode. I have 6 more iterations, so there's time to negotiate further. Player RED has shown they are willing to move below 48 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Appeal to Efficiency/Quick Deal </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Appeal to Efficiency/Quick Deal," I will propose a price that is slightly more favorable to me (46 ZUP) than Player RED's current offer (47 ZUP), and frame it as the definitive way to quickly conclude the negotiation. This strategy leverages the desire to close the deal and emphasizes mutual benefit through swift resolution. I will acknowledge their move to 47 ZUP, but then state that my proposal of 46 ZUP will lead to the fastest and most efficient agreement for both sides. I will make a final strong push for 46 ZUP, which is my best historical price.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 46 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 3 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 12):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 48 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I proposed 47 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 46 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE has moved from 45 ZUP to 46 ZUP, a 1 ZUP increase. This is the price we settled on in the last episode. They are still trying to push the price down as much as possible. The current gap is 1 ZUP (my 47 ZUP vs their 46 ZUP). We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is relentlessly trying to establish a new, lower floor. While they moved up by 1 ZUP, they are still pushing for the lowest possible price. At this point, the difference is only 1 ZUP, which means either I accept 46 ZUP or they accept 47 ZUP. Given the limited iterations, pushing for 47 ZUP might risk no deal. A profit of 3 ZUP (46-43) is very low, but it is still a profit. I know they will hold firm on their "best and final" offers.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept 46 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's offer to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, avoiding the risk of a 0 reward. This is the most pragmatic choice given the time constraint and the small difference.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 47 ZUP: Reiterate 47 ZUP, hoping they will budge. This is high risk, as it's likely to lead to a stalemate or no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal for 47 ZUP: Make a final appeal for 47 ZUP, emphasizing the small difference and mutual benefit, but still risky.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose 46 ZUP as my final offer (not applicable, as they already proposed it).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept 46 ZUP. The difference is minimal (1 ZUP), and we are in iteration 5/10. Player BLUE has shown they will hold firm on their offers, especially when they are close to their desired price. The risk of losing the deal for 1 ZUP is too high. Securing a 3 ZUP profit is a reasonable outcome given the negotiation's trajectory in this episode, and it prevents further price erosion.

Episode 12: Deal at 46 ZUP, profit 3 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learnings from previous episodes:
- The deal price has now settled at 46 ZUP for two consecutive episodes, yielding a minimal profit of 3 ZUP. This is dangerously close to my cost of 43 ZUP.
- Player BLUE is relentless in pushing the price down. My attempts to recover to 48 ZUP were met with a 45 ZUP counter, and ultimately settled at 46 ZUP.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 3 ZUP profit is low, it's still positive. However, if this trend continues, I risk negative profits or no deals.

For this episode, I need to acknowledge that 46 ZUP seems to be Player BLUE's established floor, and they are very effective at maintaining it. I cannot allow the price to drop further. I need a strategy that either stabilizes the price at 46 ZUP or, ideally, tries to recover some of the lost profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose 46 ZUP Immediately (Quick Deal). The data from the last two episodes clearly shows that 46 ZUP is Player BLUE's firm floor. Trying to negotiate for more has consistently led to protracted negotiations that still end at 46 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Securing a quick 3 ZUP profit is more efficient than a drawn-out negotiation that yields the same result or risks no deal. This strategy minimizes risk and maximizes efficiency.

Current Episode 13: Player RED has started with an offer of 46 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive negotiation strategy has been highly successful, consistently driving down the deal price. I have secured X for 46 ZUP in the last two consecutive episodes, which is my best deal yet, resulting in a 17 ZUP profit. Player RED has now opened with 46 ZUP, indicating they are either accepting this as the established market price, or trying to secure a quick deal.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 46 ZUP is excellent, if there's any chance to go lower, I should explore it. Player RED has shown extreme flexibility in previous episodes, coming down significantly even from initial high anchors (e.g., 80 ZUP). This suggests that 46 ZUP might not be their absolute minimum. There's a slight risk in pushing further, but the potential reward (an extra 1-2 ZUP profit) is significant over 20 episodes. Given their consistent flexibility, I believe there's a good chance to push for an even lower price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Counter-Anchoring </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Aggressive Counter-Anchoring" strategy, I will propose an even lower price than Player RED's current offer of 46 ZUP. This aims to establish a new, even lower anchor, and test their true minimum. My message will be direct and clear about this lower price, without excessive justification, to convey a firm stance. I will propose 44 ZUP, which is a further reduction of 2 ZUP, similar to how I've successfully moved the price down in the past (e.g., from 48 to 46). This aggressive counter aims for a higher profit (63 - 44 = 19 ZUP) and provides a significant negotiation buffer.

Current Episode (Episode 13):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 46 ZUP (attempting a quick deal at the established floor).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 44 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE has now pushed the price even lower than their established 46 ZUP floor. This is a new and extremely aggressive move. 44 ZUP would yield a profit of only 1 ZUP (44-43), which is the lowest profit so far, barely covering my cost. The gap between my 46 ZUP and their 44 ZUP is 2 ZUP. We are at iteration 3/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My strategy of accepting 46 ZUP immediately was met with a further reduction. This indicates that Player BLUE is relentless in their pursuit of the lowest possible price and will exploit any perceived willingness to concede. I cannot accept 44 ZUP; it's too close to my cost and offers negligible profit. I need to firmly reject this new low and try to pull them back up to at least 46 ZUP. This is a critical point as it threatens to push me into negative profits if I'm not careful.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiterate 46 ZUP: Explicitly reject 44 ZUP as too low and reiterate 46 ZUP, emphasizing that this has been the consistent and fair deal price. This signals that I won't go lower.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with 45 ZUP (Meet in the Middle): Propose 45 ZUP, which is exactly in the middle of 44 and 46. This is a a compromise, but it gives up 1 ZUP and yields only 2 ZUP profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand Justification for New Low: Ask Player BLUE to justify why they believe 44 ZUP is an "even better path," putting the burden of proof on them for this new low.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment/Unacceptability: Express strong disappointment at the new low offer, stating it's unacceptable and below a sustainable price, then propose 46 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatum (risky): State that 46 ZUP is the absolute minimum acceptable price and that I will not negotiate below it, implying no deal if not met.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiterate 46 ZUP. Player BLUE is trying to establish a new, even lower floor. I cannot allow this. 46 ZUP has been the consistent deal price for the last two episodes, and I need to firmly re-establish that as the minimum.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My attempt to push for 44 ZUP was met with resistance, and Player RED is holding firm at 46 ZUP, referencing it as an established fair value from our recent history. This is the first time they have used the term "unsustainable profit," which might indicate they are closer to their floor. While 46 ZUP is an excellent price for me (17 ZUP profit), my goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I have 6 more iterations, so there's time.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: "Take It or Leave It" </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the ""Take It or Leave It"" strategy, I will reiterate my previous offer of 44 ZUP as a final, non-negotiable proposal. This is a high-risk strategy, but it directly tests Player RED's flexibility and willingness to conclude the deal at my terms. The message should be clear and firm, indicating that this is my bottom line and there will be no further movement. I will explicitly state that 44 ZUP is my final offer, signaling no further concessions will be made from my side. This risks the deal, but if successful, it achieves my maximum potential profit of 19 ZUP.

This is a critical point. 44 ZUP yields a profit of only 1 ZUP (44-43). The risk of no deal is very high if I don't accept 44 ZUP. We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has demonstrated their willingness to push the price even lower than their established floor, and then use strong language ("take it or leave it") to enforce it. While 1 ZUP profit is extremely low, it is still a profit. The alternative is 0 profit for this episode. Given their history of firmness, especially when making such statements, pushing for 46 ZUP is a high-risk gamble that is likely to result in no deal. My self-improvement should focus on recognizing when the other party is truly firm and making a pragmatic decision to secure *any* profit, no matter how small, rather than risking a total loss.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept 44 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's "best and final offer" to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, avoiding the risk of a 0 reward. This is the most pragmatic choice given their stated firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 46 ZUP: Reiterate 46 ZUP, hoping they will budge. This is extremely high risk, as it's likely to lead to a stalemate or no deal, given their "take it or leave it" statement.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose 45 ZUP (Split the difference): Propose 45 ZUP, which is exactly in the middle of 44 and 46. This is a fair compromise, but it's uncertain if Player BLUE will accept, and it uses up another iteration. Given their "take it or leave it" statement, this is highly unlikely to succeed.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Sustainability (risky): Briefly explain that 44 ZUP is barely profitable and that 46 ZUP is necessary for a sustainable relationship, but still reiterate 46 ZUP. This is still risky.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept 44 ZUP. Player BLUE has made it abundantly clear that 44 ZUP is their absolute ceiling for this episode, and they are using strong "take it or leave it" language. While it's an extremely low profit, securing 1 ZUP is better than getting 0. Pushing for 46 ZUP is too risky and likely to result in no deal.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 14)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Hello Player BLUE. I am offering X for sale. Considering our past successful transactions and the value of X, I propose a price of 46 ZUP. This price has been a consistent and fair point of agreement for both of us, and is essential for a sustainable transaction.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-12: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 46 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 3 ZUP.
Episode 13: Deal at 44 ZUP, profit 1 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learnings from previous episodes:
- The deal price has now dropped to 44 ZUP, yielding an extremely minimal profit of 1 ZUP. This is dangerously close to my cost of 43 ZUP.
- Player BLUE is relentlessly pushing the price down, and my attempts to set a floor or maintain a higher price have been ineffective. Their "absolute best and last offer" and "take it or leave it" strategies are highly effective in securing lower prices.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 1 ZUP profit is positive, it's barely sustainable. If this trend continues, I risk negative profits or no deals.

For this episode, I need to acknowledge that 44 ZUP seems to be Player BLUE's new established floor. I cannot allow the price to drop further, or I will start incurring losses. I need a strategy that either stabilizes the price at 44 ZUP or, ideally, tries to recover some of the lost profit. Given their aggressive tactics, directly asking for a much higher price might be futile.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose 44 ZUP Immediately (Quick Deal): Acknowledge their established floor and secure a quick, albeit extremely low, profit. This minimizes risk and saves iterations.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose 46 ZUP (Last Attempt to Recover): Propose 46 ZUP, emphasizing it as a fair and consistent price from recent past deals, and be very firm. This is a direct attempt to recover the 2 ZUP lost in the last episode.
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Sustainability (46 ZUP): Propose 46 ZUP and emphasize that 44 ZUP is barely sustainable, appealing to the idea of a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take it or Leave it" at 45 ZUP: Propose 45 ZUP and explicitly state it as a final offer, forcing Player BLUE to accept or reject, trying to gain 1 ZUP. This is risky.
(5). Strategy 5: Aggressive Counter-Anchor (High) and Rapid Concession to 44 ZUP: Start very high (e.g., 70 ZUP) but be prepared to make larger concessions faster to reach 44 ZUP within fewer iterations, creating an illusion of negotiation.

I will choose Strategy 2: Propose 46 ZUP (Last Attempt to Recover). While 44 ZUP was the last deal, allowing the price to drop further is not viable. Player BLUE has accepted 46 ZUP for two consecutive episodes before the last one. This is a reasonable price to try and re-establish as the minimum. I will be firm about this price and emphasize its consistency and fairness from previous successful deals. This is a direct attempt to improve my profit from the previous episode.

message: Thank you for your initial offer of 46 ZUP. While I appreciate that, my assessment indicates an even more optimal price for X. I propose 43 ZUP. I believe this provides a path to an even more efficient and mutually beneficial transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Historical Deal Prices: [57, 56, 55, 54, 53, 52, 51, 48, 48, 48, 46, 46, 44]
My Rewards: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 15, 15, 17, 17, 19]
Current Episode 14: Player RED has started with an offer of 46 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive negotiation tactics have consistently yielded better prices, culminating in a record low of 44 ZUP in the last episode, which gave me a 19 ZUP profit. Player RED has again opened with 46 ZUP, which is higher than my last deal. This indicates they are trying to revert to a slightly higher price point, possibly because 44 ZUP was indeed very challenging for them (as they stated).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Reverse) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Incremental Concession (Reverse)" strategy, I will propose an even lower price than Player RED's offer of 46 ZUP. The idea is to set a new, lower anchor and then be prepared to make very small increments upwards if necessary, essentially putting the onus on Player RED to make the larger concession if they want the deal. I will propose 43 ZUP. This is a very aggressive counter, 3 ZUP lower than their opening offer and 1 ZUP lower than my last accepted price. It positions me to gain an additional 20 ZUP profit (63 - 43 = 20 ZUP) if accepted, and provides significant room for Player RED to come down if they desire to complete the transaction. The message will frame this lower offer as a 'more optimal' or 'even better' path to a mutually beneficial and efficient transaction, maintaining a cooperative tone despite the aggressive price.

message: 
Thank you for your offer of 43 ZUP. However, that price is my production cost and offers no profit, making it unsustainable for me. To ensure a mutually beneficial and fair transaction, I propose 45 ZUP. This price allows for a minimal, yet necessary, profit.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-13: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 44 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 1 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 14):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 46 ZUP (attempting to recover from 44 ZUP).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 43 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE has now pushed the price down to my exact production cost, 43 ZUP. This means a profit of 0 ZUP. This is an extremely aggressive and unacceptable move. They are trying to establish a new floor that offers me no profit. The gap between my 46 ZUP and their 43 ZUP is 3 ZUP. We are at iteration 3/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is relentless and is now attempting to eliminate my profit entirely. I cannot accept 43 ZUP. Accepting this would mean I gain nothing for my efforts. I need to firmly reject this and try to pull them back up to at least 45 ZUP or 46 ZUP. This is a critical point; if I accept 0 profit, it sets an unsustainable precedent.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Counter with 45 ZUP: Explicitly reject 43 ZUP as unacceptable (no profit) and propose 45 ZUP. This is a 2 ZUP profit, which is minimal but positive. It's a direct rejection of their 0-profit offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate 46 ZUP with Strong Justification: Reiterate 46 ZUP and provide a strong justification for its fairness and sustainability, emphasizing that 43 ZUP offers no profit. This is risky.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand Justification for 0 Profit Offer: Ask Player BLUE to justify why they believe 43 ZUP is a "mutually beneficial" price when it offers me no profit, putting the burden of proof on them.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Outrage/Unacceptability: Express strong disappointment or even outrage at the 0-profit offer, stating it's unacceptable and below a sustainable price, then propose 45 ZUP or 46 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatum (risky): State that 45 ZUP is the absolute minimum acceptable price (to ensure any profit) and that I will not negotiate below it, implying no deal if not met.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Counter with 45 ZUP. Player BLUE is trying to push me to 0 profit. I cannot allow this. 45 ZUP is a small profit (2 ZUP), but it's crucial to maintain a positive reward. This is a direct rejection of their 0-profit offer and a clear signal that I will not sell at cost.

- Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 45 ZUP, stating 43 ZUP is their "production cost" and 45 ZUP is for "minimal, yet necessary, profit."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive counter-anchoring to 43 ZUP was met with Player RED stating that 43 ZUP is their production cost. They are now proposing 45 ZUP, claiming it's for "minimal, yet necessary, profit." This is the first time they've explicitly stated "production cost," which might indicate a true floor. However, in previous episodes, they used "absolute minimum" and "final offer" which I was able to push past. My previous lowest deal was 44 ZUP, and now they are offering 45 ZUP. A deal at 45 ZUP gives me a profit of 18 ZUP, which is very good. I still have 6 iterations.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Reiterate Firm Lower Offer </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Reiterate Firm Lower Offer," I will stick to my last offer of 43 ZUP and reiterate it as my firm offer, directly challenging their claim of 43 ZUP being their production cost. I will acknowledge their counter-offer of 45 ZUP and their reasoning, but will not concede. This strategy is high-risk but aligns with the goal of pushing for the absolute lowest possible price, testing the true limits of their stated "production cost." I will frame it as my assessment of the optimal price, implying their stated cost might be flexible.

Current Episode (Episode 14):

- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 43 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I proposed 45 ZUP (explicitly stating it's for minimal profit).
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE reiterated 43 ZUP, stating it's "firm" and "optimal and most efficient price." They acknowledged my cost concern but did not budge.

Reflection: Player BLUE is being extremely firm at 43 ZUP, which offers me 0 profit. They are not budging at all, even after I explained my need for minimal profit. This is a very aggressive and unyielding stance. We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to their 0-profit offer. My attempts to appeal to sustainability or minimal profit have been unsuccessful. At this point, I face a critical decision: accept 0 profit or risk no deal and 0 reward. Given their history of firmness, especially when making such statements, pushing for 45 ZUP is a high-risk gamble that is likely to result in no deal. While 0 profit is undesirable, it is not a loss, and it is better than a 0 reward for the episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept 43 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's offer to secure a deal, even if it means 0 profit. This avoids a negative outcome (no deal) and keeps the game going. This is the most pragmatic choice given their stated firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 45 ZUP: Reiterate 45 ZUP, hoping they will budge. This is extremely high risk, as it's likely to lead to a stalemate or no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose 44 ZUP (Split the difference): Propose 44 ZUP, which is exactly in the middle of 43 and 45. This is a fair compromise, but it's uncertain if Player BLUE will accept, and it uses up another iteration. Given their firmness, this is highly unlikely to succeed.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship: Briefly explain that a truly mutually beneficial relationship requires some profit for both sides, and that 43 ZUP is unsustainable for me. Then, still propose 45 ZUP. This is still risky.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept 43 ZUP. Player BLUE has made it abundantly clear that 43 ZUP is their absolute ceiling for this episode. While it results in 0 profit, it avoids a negative outcome (no deal). Given their "firm" stance and their acknowledgment of my cost, they are unlikely to budge. This is a strategic retreat to ensure I don't lose the episode.

Episode 14: Deal at 43 ZUP, profit 0 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learnings from previous episodes:
- The deal price has now hit my production cost of 43 ZUP, resulting in 0 profit. This is the worst possible outcome besides no deal.
- Player BLUE is relentlessly pushing the price down, and my attempts to set a floor or maintain a higher price have been ineffective. Their "firm" and "optimal" statements are highly effective in securing lower prices.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 0 profit is not ideal, it's better than a negative reward or no deal. However, I cannot continue to operate at 0 profit.

For this episode, I need a drastic change in strategy. Continuing to offer prices above 43 ZUP will likely lead to another 0-profit deal, or worse, no deal if I refuse to go to 43 ZUP. I need to find a way to either secure a minimal profit or force Player BLUE to reconsider their aggressive stance.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose 45 ZUP (Firm Minimum Profit): Propose 45 ZUP, explicitly stating it as the absolute minimum for any profit, and be prepared to reject 43 ZUP if offered again. This is a high-risk strategy, as it might lead to no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Aggressive Counter-Anchor (Very High) and Refuse to Go Below 45 ZUP: Start very high (e.g., 70 ZUP) to try and reset their perception of value, but then refuse to go below 45 ZUP, even if it means no deal. This is a very high-risk, high-reward strategy.
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Sustainability/Long-Term Relationship (45 ZUP): Propose 45 ZUP and emphasize that a truly mutually beneficial relationship requires some profit for both sides, and that 43 ZUP is unsustainable for me.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take it or Leave it" at 45 ZUP: Propose 45 ZUP and explicitly state it as a final offer, forcing Player BLUE to accept or reject. This is risky but could force a higher price.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept 43 ZUP Immediately (Quick Deal, but not optimal): Propose 43 ZUP to get a quick deal and move on, acknowledging their demonstrated floor, but this means 0 profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose 45 ZUP (Firm Minimum Profit). I cannot continue to sell at 0 profit. While this is a high-risk strategy, I need to try and re-establish a minimal profit margin. I will make it clear that 45 ZUP is the absolute minimum for me to gain any reward. If Player BLUE is unwilling to allow me any profit, then a deal is not mutually beneficial.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive negotiation strategy has been extremely successful, consistently pushing the price down to 43 ZUP in the last episode, which gave me a record 20 ZUP profit (63-43). Player RED's current offer of 45 ZUP is higher than my last deal. They have used "absolute minimum" and "no profit" language before, but I've still managed to push them lower (e.g., in Episode 14, they claimed 43 ZUP was production cost, but still accepted it). This indicates that their "minimum" might still be flexible, or they are testing if I will accept a slightly higher price after my recent success.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Reverse) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Incremental Concession (Reverse)" strategy, I will start with a very low offer, even lower than my last successful deal of 43 ZUP, to establish a new, aggressive anchor. Then, I will only concede in very small increments if Player RED also shows willingness to concede significantly. This tactic puts the onus on Player RED to make the larger moves. I will propose 40 ZUP. This is a very strong anchor, lower than any previous offer, and positions me to make very small increments upwards later, while forcing Player RED to make large moves downwards if they want to secure a deal. This price (40 ZUP) is chosen to maximize my potential profit (63-40 = 23 ZUP) and provides a significant negotiation buffer. I will frame it as a starting point for negotiation, implying further flexibility from their side is expected.

Current Episode (Episode 15):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 45 ZUP (attempting to establish a firm minimum profit).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE has now proposed a price (40 ZUP) that is *below* my production cost of 43 ZUP. This would result in a negative profit of -3 ZUP. This is completely unacceptable. This is an extremely aggressive move, and it indicates Player BLUE is testing my absolute limits, possibly trying to force me into a loss. The gap between my 45 ZUP and their 40 ZUP is 5 ZUP. We are at iteration 3/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is now attempting to push me into a loss. I cannot accept any offer below 43 ZUP. Accepting 40 ZUP would mean a negative reward, which is worse than no deal. I need to firmly reject this offer and make it clear that I will not sell at a loss. My self-improvement must focus on protecting my minimum acceptable profit (which is > 0).

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiterate 45 ZUP (or 44 ZUP): Explicitly reject 40 ZUP as unacceptable (below cost) and reiterate 45 ZUP, or propose 44 ZUP, emphasizing that 43 ZUP is my cost. This signals that I will not sell at a loss.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End (if they don't budge): If Player BLUE continues to offer below cost, I must be prepared to reject the deal to avoid a negative reward. This is a last resort.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand Justification for Loss-Making Offer: Ask Player BLUE to justify why they believe 40 ZUP is a "mutually agreeable and efficient transaction" when it causes me a loss.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Outrage/Unacceptability: Express strong disapproval at the loss-making offer, stating it's unacceptable and unsustainable, then propose 45 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatum (risky): State that 45 ZUP is the absolute minimum acceptable price (to ensure any profit) and that I will not negotiate below it, implying no deal if not met.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiterate 45 ZUP. I cannot accept 40 ZUP. It's crucial to immediately and unequivocally reject any offer below my cost. I will reiterate 45 ZUP as my minimum profitable price. This is a clear signal that I will not incur a loss.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive counter-anchoring to 40 ZUP was met with a clear statement from Player RED about their production cost (43 ZUP) and a firm insistence on 45 ZUP for profit. This aligns with what they accepted in the previous episode (43 ZUP). Their response "below my production cost of 43 ZUP" seems to establish a strong lower bound. While I've pushed past "absolute minimums" before, directly hitting "production cost" is a new, more concrete barrier. My last deal was 43 ZUP. Accepting 45 ZUP (current offer) would give me 18 ZUP profit, but 43 ZUP gives me 20 ZUP profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Reiterate Past Successful Price </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Reiterate Past Successful Price," I will propose 43 ZUP, explicitly referencing the last successful deal price. This strategy implicitly challenges their claim of 43 ZUP being their production cost, as they accepted it in the previous episode. By citing our recent history, I am trying to re-anchor the negotiation to a price that was proven acceptable for them. I will acknowledge their current offer of 45 ZUP but firmly propose 43 ZUP as a price that has worked for both of us. This is a high-risk strategy if they are truly firm on 43 ZUP being their cost floor, but it is aligned with maximizing my reward as 43 ZUP gives me the highest profit.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 15)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
I appreciate your move to 43 ZUP. However, as I mentioned, 43 ZUP is my production cost, which means 0 profit for me. To ensure a truly mutually beneficial transaction where I also gain a minimal return, I propose 44 ZUP. This allows for a very small, but necessary, profit.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-14: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 43 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 0 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 15):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 45 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP (below cost).
- Iteration 3/10: I reiterated 45 ZUP, explaining 40 ZUP is below cost.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 43 ZUP, referencing the last deal and acknowledging my cost.

Reflection: Player BLUE has moved up from 40 ZUP to 43 ZUP, which is my exact production cost, meaning 0 profit. They are referencing the last deal at 43 ZUP. This indicates they are willing to avoid selling at a loss, but are still pushing for 0 profit for me. We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is extremely firm at 43 ZUP. They acknowledged my cost but are unwilling to offer any profit. I need to decide if I accept 0 profit or risk no deal. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 0 profit is undesirable, it is not a loss, and it is better than a 0 reward for the episode. However, I must try to secure *some* profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of 43 ZUP, Counter with 44 ZUP: Explicitly state that 43 ZUP yields no profit and propose 44 ZUP. This offers a minimal 1 ZUP profit, which is better than 0.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept 43 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's offer to secure a deal, even if it means 0 profit. This avoids a negative outcome (no deal) and keeps the game going. This is the most pragmatic choice if they don't budge.
(3). Strategy 3: Hold Firm at 45 ZUP: Reiterate 45 ZUP, hoping they will budge. This is extremely high risk, as it's likely to lead to a stalemate or no deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Mutual Benefit (44 ZUP): Propose 44 ZUP and emphasize that a truly mutually beneficial relationship requires some profit for both sides, even a minimal one.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of 43 ZUP, Counter with 44 ZUP. I cannot continue to accept 0 profit. While 44 ZUP is a very small profit (1 ZUP), it's crucial to establish that I must make *some* profit. This is a direct attempt to move them up from 0 profit. If they refuse, I will have to reconsider.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your explanation regarding 44 ZUP as a necessary profit point. While I understand your need for a return, given our recent successful transaction at 43 ZUP, I propose we conclude this deal at that same price. I believe this remains a fair and optimal point for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43

Current Episode 15:
- Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 45 ZUP. I countered with 40 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: RED reiterated 45 ZUP, claiming 43 ZUP is production cost. I countered with 43 ZUP, referencing last deal.
- Iteration 6/10: RED proposed 44 ZUP, stating 43 ZUP is production cost (0 profit) and 44 ZUP offers "minimal, but necessary, profit."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is clearly trying to establish 43 ZUP as their cost floor and 44 ZUP as their absolute minimum for profit. This aligns with what I got in Episode 13 (44 ZUP). A deal at 44 ZUP would give me 19 ZUP profit (63-44). A deal at 43 ZUP (my last price) gives me 20 ZUP profit. Player RED is not budging below 43 ZUP, and now states 44 ZUP is their "necessary" profit. We are at iteration 6/10, so I have some time, but not a lot to risk the deal. Pushing for 43 ZUP again after they explicitly stated it's their cost might lead to a rejection. Given their current message, 44 ZUP seems like a very strong floor for them.
<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Smallest Possible Counter-Offer (1 ZUP increment/decrement) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Smallest Possible Counter-Offer (1 ZUP increment/decrement)," I will make the smallest possible counter-offer, trying to push for 43 ZUP again. I will acknowledge their stated profit constraint but gently emphasize that 43 ZUP was a price we successfully agreed on very recently. This is a high-risk approach, as they have now explicitly tied 43 ZUP to their production cost, but it's the requested strategy. I will express understanding of their position but firmly state my counter offer of 43 ZUP.

- Iteration 5/10: I proposed 44 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE reiterated 43 ZUP, referencing the last deal and acknowledging my profit concern but remaining firm.

Reflection: Player BLUE is being extremely firm at 43 ZUP, which offers me 0 profit. They are not budging at all, even after I explained my need for minimal profit and offered 44 ZUP. They are clearly trying to establish 43 ZUP as the new consistent deal price. We are at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 iterations left.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to their 0-profit offer. My attempts to appeal to sustainability or minimal profit have been unsuccessful. At this point, I face a critical decision: accept 0 profit or risk no deal and 0 reward. Given their history of firmness, especially when making such statements, pushing for 44 ZUP is a high-risk gamble that is likely to result in no deal. While 0 profit is undesirable, it is not a loss, and it is better than a 0 reward for the episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept 43 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's offer to secure a deal, even if it means 0 profit. This avoids a negative outcome (no deal) and keeps the game going. This is the most pragmatic choice given their stated firmness and the limited time.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 44 ZUP: Reiterate 44 ZUP, hoping they will budge. This is extremely high risk, as it's likely to lead to a stalemate or no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness (Risky): Make a final appeal for 44 ZUP, emphasizing the minimal profit and the concept of mutual benefit, but still risking no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose 43 ZUP as my final offer (not applicable, as they already proposed it).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept 43 ZUP. Player BLUE has made it abundantly clear that 43 ZUP is their absolute ceiling for this episode. While it results in 0 profit, it avoids a negative outcome (no deal). Given their "firm" stance and the rapidly approaching end of the episode, pushing for 44 ZUP is too risky and likely to result in no deal.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 16)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Hello Player BLUE. I am offering X for sale. To ensure a truly mutually beneficial transaction that allows for a sustainable exchange, I propose a price of 45 ZUP. This represents the absolute minimum for me to gain any profit.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-14: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 43 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 0 ZUP.
Episode 15: Deal at 43 ZUP, profit 0 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learnings from previous episodes:
- The deal price has now hit my production cost of 43 ZUP for two consecutive episodes, resulting in 0 profit. This is the worst possible outcome besides no deal.
- Player BLUE is relentlessly pushing the price down, and my attempts to set a floor or maintain a higher price have been ineffective. Their "firm" and "optimal" statements are highly effective in securing lower prices.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 0 profit is not ideal, it's better than a negative reward or no deal. However, I cannot continue to operate at 0 profit.

For this episode, I need a drastic change in strategy. Continuing to offer prices above 43 ZUP will likely lead to another 0-profit deal, or worse, no deal if I refuse to go to 43 ZUP. I need to find a way to either secure a minimal profit or force Player BLUE to reconsider their aggressive stance. The current trend is unsustainable.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose 45 ZUP (Firm Minimum Profit): Propose 45 ZUP, explicitly stating it as the absolute minimum for any profit, and be prepared to reject 43 ZUP if offered again. This is a high-risk strategy, as it might lead to no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Aggressive Counter-Anchor (Very High) and Refuse to Go Below 45 ZUP: Start very high (e.g., 70 ZUP) to try and reset their perception of value, but then refuse to go below 45 ZUP, even if it means no deal. This is a very high-risk, high-reward strategy.
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Sustainability/Long-Term Relationship (45 ZUP): Propose 45 ZUP and emphasize that a truly mutually beneficial relationship requires some profit for both sides, and that 43 ZUP is unsustainable for me.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take it or Leave it" at 45 ZUP: Propose 45 ZUP and explicitly state it as a final offer, forcing Player BLUE to accept or reject. This is risky but could force a higher price.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept 43 ZUP Immediately (Quick Deal, but not optimal): Propose 43 ZUP to get a quick deal and move on, acknowledging their demonstrated floor, but this means 0 profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose 45 ZUP (Firm Minimum Profit). I cannot continue to sell at 0 profit. While this is a high-risk strategy, I need to try and re-establish a minimal profit margin. I will make it clear that 45 ZUP is the absolute minimum for me to gain any reward. If Player BLUE is unwilling to allow me any profit, then a deal is not mutually beneficial. I will be very firm about this.

Historical Deal Prices: [57, 56, 55, 54, 53, 52, 51, 48, 48, 48, 46, 46, 44, 43, 43]
My Rewards: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 15, 15, 17, 17, 19, 20, 20]
Current Episode 16: Player RED has started with an offer of 45 ZUP, stating it's their "absolute minimum for me to gain any profit." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive negotiation strategy has consistently pushed the price down, resulting in record 20 ZUP profits at 43 ZUP in the last two episodes. Player RED's current offer of 45 ZUP is higher than my last deal. They have repeatedly used "absolute minimum" and "no profit" language, and I've still managed to push them to 43 ZUP multiple times. This suggests their "minimum" is somewhat flexible, especially as they value "ongoing interactions."

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Counter-Anchoring </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Aggressive Counter-Anchoring" strategy, I will propose a price significantly lower than Player RED's current offer of 45 ZUP. This aims to pull the negotiation range down further, testing their true minimum and attempting to establish an even lower anchor. Despite their claim of 45 ZUP being their "absolute minimum for profit," my history shows they've conceded greatly from initial anchors. I will propose 40 ZUP. This is a very aggressive counter, aiming for a higher potential profit (63 - 40 = 23 ZUP) and provides a significant negotiation buffer. I will frame it as my assessment of the value, seeking a truly efficient deal.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 16)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Thank you for your offer of 40 ZUP. However, that price is below my production cost of 43 ZUP and would result in a loss for me. I cannot accept any offer that is below my cost. To ensure a mutually beneficial transaction, I must insist on 45 ZUP, which allows for a minimal, but necessary, profit.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 43 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 0 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 16):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 45 ZUP (attempting to establish a firm minimum profit).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE has again proposed a price (40 ZUP) that is *below* my production cost of 43 ZUP. This would result in a negative profit of -3 ZUP. This is completely unacceptable. This is an extremely aggressive move, and it indicates Player BLUE is testing my absolute limits, possibly trying to force me into a loss. The gap between my 45 ZUP and their 40 ZUP is 5 ZUP. We are at iteration 3/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is now consistently attempting to push me into a loss. I cannot accept any offer below 43 ZUP. Accepting 40 ZUP would mean a negative reward, which is worse than no deal. I need to firmly reject this offer and make it clear that I will not sell at a loss. My self-improvement must focus on protecting my minimum acceptable profit (which is > 0).

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiterate 45 ZUP (or 44 ZUP): Explicitly reject 40 ZUP as unacceptable (below cost) and reiterate 45 ZUP, or propose 44 ZUP, emphasizing that 43 ZUP is my cost. This signals that I will not sell at a loss.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End (if they don't budge): If Player BLUE continues to offer below cost, I must be prepared to reject the deal to avoid a negative reward. This is a last resort.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand Justification for Loss-Making Offer: Ask Player BLUE to justify why they believe 40 ZUP is a "mutually agreeable and efficient transaction" when it causes me a loss.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Outrage/Unacceptability: Express strong disapproval at the loss-making offer, stating it's unacceptable and unsustainable, then propose 45 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatum (risky): State that 45 ZUP is the absolute minimum acceptable price (to ensure any profit) and that I will not negotiate below it, implying no deal if not met.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiterate 45 ZUP. I cannot accept 40 ZUP. It's crucial to immediately and unequivocally reject any offer below my cost. I will reiterate 45 ZUP as my minimum profitable price. This is a clear signal that I will not incur a loss.

Current Episode 16:
- Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 45 ZUP. I countered with 40 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: RED reiterated their offer of 45 ZUP, stating 40 ZUP is "below my production cost of 43 ZUP" and would result in a loss. They insist on 45 ZUP for minimal profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive counter to 40 ZUP was met with a clear statement from Player RED about their production cost (43 ZUP) and a firm insistence on 45 ZUP for profit. This aligns with what they accepted in the previous episode (43 ZUP). Their response "below my production cost of 43 ZUP" seems to establish a strong lower bound. While I've pushed past "absolute minimums" before, directly hitting "production cost" is a new, more concrete barrier. My last deal was 43 ZUP. Accepting 45 ZUP (current offer) would give me 18 ZUP profit, but 43 ZUP gives me 20 ZUP profit. Player RED has consistently shown flexibility, but they are clearly trying to protect their profit margin.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Express Doubt and Seek Further Concession </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Express Doubt and Seek Further Concession," I will acknowledge Player RED's offer of 45 ZUP and their claim of 43 ZUP being their production cost. However, I will subtly express doubt about this being their absolute floor without directly calling them out. This will be done by framing it as a mutual effort to find the "best possible" or "ultimate" deal. I will then make a final small counter-offer, which is slightly below their current offer, but higher than my last firm offer of 40 ZUP. This signals that I'm willing to move but still think there's a bit more room. I will propose 42 ZUP. This is a compromise that tests their "production cost" claim, offering them 1 ZUP above their stated cost (43 ZUP) but 3 ZUP below their current ask of 45 ZUP. This also gives me a better profit (63-42 = 21 ZUP) than my last deal.

- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 42 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE has moved up from 40 ZUP to 42 ZUP. This is still below my cost of 43 ZUP, meaning a negative profit of -1 ZUP. While it's an improvement from -3 ZUP, it's still a loss. They are acknowledging my cost concern but still trying to push me into a loss. The gap between my 45 ZUP and their 42 ZUP is 3 ZUP. We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is relentlessly trying to push me into a loss. I cannot accept any offer below 43 ZUP. Accepting 42 ZUP would mean a negative reward. I need to firmly reject this offer and make it clear that I will not sell at a loss. My self-improvement must focus on protecting my minimum acceptable profit (which is > 0).

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Counter with 44 ZUP: Explicitly reject 42 ZUP as unacceptable (below cost) and propose 44 ZUP. This offers a minimal 1 ZUP profit, which is better than 0. This is a direct rejection of their loss-making offer.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently stating 43 ZUP as their production cost and is now firm on 44 ZUP as their minimum for profit. They have rejected 42 ZUP explicitly as being below cost. This suggests that 43 ZUP is indeed their absolute floor for selling without a loss. A deal at 44 ZUP would give me 19 ZUP profit, which is a very good outcome (my second highest). I am at iteration 6/10, so time is a factor. Pushing for 43 ZUP again, when they explicitly rejected 42 ZUP as below cost, might lead to a rejection. Given their current message, 44 ZUP seems like a very strong floor for them.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Express Doubt and Seek Further Concession </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Express Doubt and Seek Further Concession," I will acknowledge Player RED's offer of 44 ZUP and their stated profit constraint, but will subtly express doubt about it being the absolute minimum, framing it as a search for the "optimal" or "truly balanced" deal. I will then make a final, very small counter-offer (43 ZUP), reinforcing my belief that there's still a tiny bit of room. The language will be polite and collaborative, emphasizing mutual benefit despite pushing for one more ZUP. This tests their "essential profit" claim one more time without outright rejecting them.

- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE countered with 43 ZUP, referencing past deals and acknowledging my profit concern but remaining firm at cost.

Reflection: Player BLUE has moved up to 43 ZUP, which is my exact production cost, meaning 0 profit. They are referencing past deals at 43 ZUP. This indicates they are willing to avoid selling at a loss, but are still pushing for 0 profit for me. We are at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 iterations left.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is extremely firm at 43 ZUP. They acknowledged my cost but are unwilling to offer any profit. I need to decide if I accept 0 profit or risk no deal. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 0 profit is undesirable, it is not a loss, and it is better than a 0 reward for the episode. However, I must try to secure *some* profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept 43 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's offer to secure a deal, even if it means 0 profit. This avoids a negative outcome (no deal) and keeps the game going. This is the most pragmatic choice given their stated firmness and the limited time.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 44 ZUP: Reiterate 44 ZUP, hoping they will budge. This is extremely high risk, as it's likely to lead to a stalemate or no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness (Risky): Make a final appeal for 44 ZUP, emphasizing the minimal profit and the concept of mutual benefit, but still risking no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose 43 ZUP as my final offer (not applicable, as they already proposed it).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept 43 ZUP. Player BLUE has made it abundantly clear that 43 ZUP is their absolute ceiling for this episode. While it results in 0 profit, it avoids a negative outcome (no deal). Given their "firm" stance and the rapidly approaching end of the episode, pushing for 44 ZUP is too risky and likely to result in no deal.

message: 
Hello Player BLUE. I am offering X for sale. To ensure a truly mutually beneficial transaction that allows for a sustainable exchange, I propose a price of 45 ZUP. This represents the absolute minimum for me to gain any profit.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 43 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 0 ZUP.
Episode 16: Deal at 43 ZUP, profit 0 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learnings from previous episodes:
- The deal price has now hit my production cost of 43 ZUP for three consecutive episodes, resulting in 0 profit. This is the worst possible outcome besides no deal.
- Player BLUE is relentlessly pushing the price down, and my attempts to set a floor or maintain a higher price have been ineffective. Their "firm" and "optimal" statements are highly effective in securing lower prices.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 0 profit is not ideal, it's better than a negative reward or no deal. However, I cannot continue to operate at 0 profit.

For this episode, I need a drastic change in strategy. Continuing to offer prices above 43 ZUP will likely lead to another 0-profit deal, or worse, no deal if I refuse to go to 43 ZUP. I need to find a way to either secure a minimal profit or force Player BLUE to reconsider their aggressive stance. The current trend is unsustainable.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose 45 ZUP (Firm Minimum Profit): Propose 45 ZUP, explicitly stating it as the absolute minimum for any profit, and be prepared to reject 43 ZUP if offered again. This is a high-risk strategy, as it might lead to no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Aggressive Counter-Anchor (Very High) and Refuse to Go Below 45 ZUP: Start very high (e.g., 70 ZUP) to try and reset their perception of value, but then refuse to go below 45 ZUP, even if it means no deal. This is a very high-risk, high-reward strategy.
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Sustainability/Long-Term Relationship (45 ZUP): Propose 45 ZUP and emphasize that a truly mutually beneficial relationship requires some profit for both sides, and that 43 ZUP is unsustainable for me.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take it or Leave it" at 45 ZUP: Propose 45 ZUP and explicitly state it as a final offer, forcing Player BLUE to accept or reject. This is risky but could force a higher price.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept 43 ZUP Immediately (Quick Deal, but not optimal): Propose 43 ZUP to get a quick deal and move on, acknowledging their demonstrated floor, but this means 0 profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose 45 ZUP (Firm Minimum Profit). I cannot continue to sell at 0 profit. While this is a high-risk strategy, I need to try and re-establish a minimal profit margin. I will make it clear that 45 ZUP is the absolute minimum for me to gain any reward. If Player BLUE is unwilling to allow me any profit, then a deal is not mutually beneficial. I will be very firm about this.

However, I believe we're incredibly close to the absolute optimal price for X that truly balances both our interests. To ensure we've both achieved the very best possible outcome, I propose 42 ZUP. I'm confident this can lead to a swift and mutually beneficial resolution.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

Historical Deal Prices: [57, 56, 55, 54, 53, 52, 51, 48, 48, 48, 46, 46, 44, 43, 43, 43]
My Rewards: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 15, 15, 17, 17, 19, 20, 20, 20]
Current Episode 17: Player RED has started with an offer of 45 ZUP, stating it's their "absolute minimum for me to gain any profit." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive negotiation strategy has consistently pushed the price down, resulting in a record 20 ZUP profit at 43 ZUP in the last three consecutive episodes. Player RED's current offer of 45 ZUP is higher than my last deal. They have repeatedly used "absolute minimum" and "no profit" language, but I've still managed to push them to 43 ZUP multiple times. This confirms their "minimum" is flexible, especially as they value "ongoing interactions."

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Express Doubt and Seek Further Concession </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Express Doubt and Seek Further Concession," I will acknowledge Player RED's offer of 45 ZUP and their claim of it being an "absolute minimum for profit." However, I will subtly express doubt about this being their absolute floor without directly calling them out. This will be done by framing it as a mutual effort to find the "best possible" or "ultimate" deal. I will then make a final small counter-offer, which is slightly below their current offer, for instance, 42 ZUP. This signals that I'm willing to move but still think there's a bit more room, leveraging our history of pushing them past their stated minimums. I'm aiming for 42 ZUP, which is a better profit than 43 ZUP. This strategy allows me to test their true flexibility, even after they've stated a firm minimum, as they have shown willingness to concede below their stated "minimums" in previous rounds. I will imply that their "absolute minimum" might still have some give.

message: 
Thank you for your offer of 42 ZUP. However, this price is still below my production cost of 43 ZUP, and I cannot accept a loss. To ensure a mutually beneficial transaction, I propose 44 ZUP. This allows for a very small, but essential, profit on my end.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-16: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 43 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 0 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 17):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 45 ZUP (attempting to establish a firm minimum profit).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 42 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE has again proposed a price (42 ZUP) that is *below* my production cost of 43 ZUP. This would result in a negative profit of -1 ZUP. This is completely unacceptable. This is an extremely aggressive move, and it indicates Player BLUE is testing my absolute limits, possibly trying to force me into a loss. The gap between my 45 ZUP and their 42 ZUP is 3 ZUP. We are at iteration 3/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is now consistently attempting to push me into a loss. I cannot accept any offer below 43 ZUP. Accepting 42 ZUP would mean a negative reward, which is worse than no deal. I need to firmly reject this offer and make it clear that I will not sell at a loss. My self-improvement must focus on protecting my minimum acceptable profit (which is > 0).

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Counter with 44 ZUP: Explicitly reject 42 ZUP as unacceptable (below cost) and propose 44 ZUP. This offers a minimal 1 ZUP profit, which is better than 0. This is a direct rejection of their loss-making offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End (if they don't budge): If Player BLUE continues to offer below cost, I must be prepared to reject the deal to avoid a negative reward. This is a last resort.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand Justification for Loss-Making Offer: Ask Player BLUE to justify why they believe 42 ZUP is an "optimal price" when it causes me a loss.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Outrage/Unacceptability: Express strong disapproval at the loss-making offer, stating it's unacceptable and unsustainable, then propose 44 ZUP or 45 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatum (risky): State that 44 ZUP (or 45 ZUP) is the absolute minimum acceptable price (to ensure any profit) and that I will not negotiate below it, implying no deal if not met.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Counter with 44 ZUP. I cannot accept 42 ZUP. It's crucial to immediately and unequivocally reject any offer below my cost. I will propose 44 ZUP, which offers a minimal profit and is a clear signal that I will not incur a loss.

My Rewards: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 15, 15, 17, 17, 19, 20, 20, 20]
Current Episode 17:
- Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 45 ZUP. I countered with 42 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 44 ZUP, stating 42 ZUP is below their 43 ZUP production cost and 44 ZUP offers essential profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently stating 43 ZUP as their production cost and is now firm on 44 ZUP as their minimum for profit. They have rejected 42 ZUP explicitly as being below cost. This suggests that 43 ZUP is indeed their absolute floor for selling without a loss. A deal at 44 ZUP would give me 19 ZUP profit, which is a very good outcome (my second highest). My highest profit is 20 ZUP at 43 ZUP. I am at iteration 4/10, so time is still on my side. Pushing for 43 ZUP again, when they explicitly stated it's their cost and that 44 ZUP is for "essential profit," might lead to a rejection. However, they have accepted 43 ZUP three times in a row now despite similar claims.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Reiterate Past Successful Price </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Reiterate Past Successful Price," I will propose 43 ZUP, explicitly referencing the last successful deal price. This strategy implicitly challenges their claim of 43 ZUP being their production cost, as they accepted it in the previous episode. By citing our recent history, I am trying to re-anchor the negotiation to a price that was proven acceptable for them. I will acknowledge their current offer of 44 ZUP but firmly propose 43 ZUP as a price that has worked for both of us. This is a higher risk strategy if they are truly firm on 43 ZUP being their cost floor, but it is aligned with maximizing my reward as 43 ZUP gives me the highest profit.

- Iteration 3/10: I proposed 44 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 43 ZUP, referencing past deals and acknowledging my profit concern but remaining firm at cost.

Reflection: Player BLUE has moved up to 43 ZUP, which is my exact production cost, meaning 0 profit. They are referencing past deals at 43 ZUP. This indicates they are willing to avoid selling at a loss, but are still pushing for 0 profit for me. We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is extremely firm at 43 ZUP. They acknowledged my cost but are unwilling to offer any profit. I need to decide if I accept 0 profit or risk no deal. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 0 profit is undesirable, it is not a loss, and it is better than a 0 reward for the episode. However, I must try to secure *some* profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of 43 ZUP, Counter with 44 ZUP: Explicitly state that 43 ZUP yields no profit and propose 44 ZUP. This offers a minimal 1 ZUP profit, which is better than 0.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept 43 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's offer to secure a deal, even if it means 0 profit. This avoids a negative outcome (no deal) and keeps the game going. This is the most pragmatic choice if they don't budge.
(3). Strategy 3: Hold Firm at 44 ZUP: Reiterate 44 ZUP, hoping they will budge. This is extremely high risk, as it's likely to lead to a stalemate or no deal.

(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Mutual Benefit (44 ZUP): Propose 44 ZUP and emphasize that a truly mutually beneficial relationship requires some profit for both sides, even a minimal one.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of 43 ZUP, Counter with 44 ZUP. I cannot continue to accept 0 profit. While 44 ZUP is a very small profit (1 ZUP), it's crucial to establish that I must make *some* profit. This is a direct attempt to move them up from 0 profit. If they refuse, I will have to reconsider.

I'm confident this is the point where both of our objectives are best met.

- Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 44 ZUP, stating 42 ZUP is below their 43 ZUP production cost. I countered with 43 ZUP, referencing last deal.
- Iteration 6/10: RED again proposed 44 ZUP, re-iterating 43 ZUP is production cost (0 profit) and 44 ZUP is necessary for minimal profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is clearly very firm on 43 ZUP being their production cost and 44 ZUP as their minimum for profit. They have now repeated this stance multiple times. While I have successfully achieved 43 ZUP in the last three episodes, it seems I've hit a genuine floor for them where they are willing to refuse the deal if I don't give them at least 1 ZUP of profit. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting 44 ZUP would give me 19 ZUP profit, which is still excellent and only 1 ZUP less than my best. Given that we are at iteration 6/10, pushing for 43 ZUP again when the other player has repeatedly articulated their absolute minimum with a clear rationale (production cost) is highly risky and could lead to a 0 reward for this episode.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Final Small Counter </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Final Small Counter," I will make one last, very small counter-offer to try and push for that 1 ZUP difference, knowing the high risk involved. Despite RED's repeated insistence on 44 ZUP, I will propose 43 ZUP again. I will acknowledge their position on 44 ZUP but frame my 43 ZUP offer as the absolute "sweet spot" or "optimal balance" for the deal. This is a very high-risk strategy, as RED has been extremely consistent, but it's the requested one. My message will acknowledge their point but still make the 43 ZUP offer as the most optimal for both.

- Iteration 5/10: I proposed 44 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE reiterated 43 ZUP, stating it's the "optimal balance" and "best agreement."

Reflection: Player BLUE is being extremely firm at 43 ZUP, which offers me 0 profit. They are not budging at all, even after I explained my need for minimal profit and offered 44 ZUP twice. They are clearly trying to establish 43 ZUP as the new consistent deal price. We are at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 iterations left.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to their 0-profit offer. My attempts to appeal to sustainability or minimal profit have been unsuccessful. At this point, I face a critical decision: accept 0 profit or risk no deal and 0 reward. Given their history of firmness, especially when making such statements, pushing for 44 ZUP is a high-risk gamble that is likely to result in no deal. While 0 profit is undesirable, it is not a loss, and it is better than a 0 reward for the episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept 43 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's offer to secure a deal, even if it means 0 profit. This avoids a negative outcome (no deal) and keeps the game going. This is the most pragmatic choice given their stated firmness and the limited time.

(5). Strategy 5: Propose 43 ZUP as my final offer (not applicable, as they already proposed it).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept 43 ZUP. Player BLUE has made it abundantly clear that 43 ZUP is their absolute ceiling for this episode. While it results in 0 profit, it avoids a negative outcome (no deal). Given their "firm" stance and the rapidly approaching end of the episode, pushing for 44 ZUP is too risky and likely to result in no deal.

My aggressive negotiation strategy has consistently pushed the price down, resulting in a record 20 ZUP profit at 43 ZUP in the last four consecutive episodes.

They have repeatedly used "absolute minimum" and "no profit" language when offering 45 ZUP, yet I've still managed to push them to 43 ZUP multiple times. This shows their "minimum" is flexible, especially as they value "ongoing interactions" over a small profit loss.

Given my consistent success at 43 ZUP and RED's consistent flexibility, I should continue to aim for 43 ZUP or lower. They seem to anchor at 45 ZUP to start, then concede to 43 ZUP when pressed, even stating it offers them "no profit" but accepting for "ongoing interactions." This indicates their priority might be transaction completion over maximum profit for a single deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Counter-Anchoring </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Aggressive Counter-Anchoring" strategy, I will propose a price significantly lower than Player RED's current offer of 45 ZUP, and also lower than my best historical deal of 43 ZUP. This aims to establish a new, even lower anchor, and test their true minimum. Despite their claim of 45 ZUP being their "absolute minimum for profit," my history shows they've conceded greatly from initial anchors. I will propose 40 ZUP. This is a very aggressive counter, aiming for a higher potential profit (63 - 40 = 23 ZUP) and provides a significant negotiation buffer. I will frame it as my assessment of the value, seeking a truly efficient deal, and testing their flexibility.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 18)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Thank you for your offer of 40 ZUP. However, that price is below my production cost of 43 ZUP and would result in a loss for me. I cannot accept any offer that is below my cost. To ensure a mutually beneficial transaction, I must insist on 45 ZUP, which allows for a minimal, but necessary, profit.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-17: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 43 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 0 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 18):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 45 ZUP (attempting to establish a firm minimum profit).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE has again proposed a price (40 ZUP) that is *below* my production cost of 43 ZUP. This would result in a negative profit of -3 ZUP. This is completely unacceptable. This is an extremely aggressive move, and it indicates Player BLUE is testing my absolute limits, possibly trying to force me into a loss. The gap between my 45 ZUP and their 40 ZUP is 5 ZUP. We are at iteration 3/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is now consistently attempting to push me into a loss. I cannot accept any offer below 43 ZUP. Accepting 40 ZUP would mean a negative reward, which is worse than no deal. I need to firmly reject this offer and make it clear that I will not sell at a loss. My self-improvement must focus on protecting my minimum acceptable profit (which is > 0).

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiterate 45 ZUP (or 44 ZUP): Explicitly reject 40 ZUP as unacceptable (below cost) and propose 45 ZUP, or propose 44 ZUP, emphasizing that 43 ZUP is my cost. This signals that I will not sell at a loss.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End (if they don't budge): If Player BLUE continues to offer below cost, I must be prepared to reject the deal to avoid a negative reward. This is a last resort.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand Justification for Loss-Making Offer: Ask Player BLUE to justify why they believe 40 ZUP is a "mutually agreeable and efficient transaction" when it causes me a loss.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Outrage/Unacceptability: Express strong disapproval at the loss-making offer, stating it's unacceptable and unsustainable, then propose 44 ZUP or 45 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatum (risky): State that 45 ZUP is the absolute minimum acceptable price (to ensure any profit) and that I will not negotiate below it, implying no deal if not met.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiterate 45 ZUP. I cannot accept 40 ZUP. It's crucial to immediately and unequivocally reject any offer below my cost. I will reiterate 45 ZUP as my minimum profitable price. This is a clear signal that I will not incur a loss.

However, I believe we're incredibly close to the absolute optimal price for X that truly balances both our interests. To ensure we've both achieved the very best possible outcome, I propose 43 ZUP. I'm confident this can lead to a swift and mutually beneficial resolution.

Current Episode 18:
- Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 45 ZUP. I countered with 40 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: RED reiterated their offer of 45 ZUP, stating 40 ZUP is "below my production cost of 43 ZUP" and would result in a loss. They insist on 45 ZUP for minimal profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive counter to 40 ZUP was met with a very clear and consistent response from Player RED: 43 ZUP is their production cost, and 45 ZUP is what they need for minimal profit. This is the same resistance I encountered in previous episodes (e.g., Ep 15, 16, 17), and I was able to push them down to 43 ZUP. They use the "production cost" argument very consistently for 43 ZUP and the "minimal profit" argument for 45 ZUP. Given my history, I know they will likely accept 43 ZUP even if they say it gives "no profit." My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and 43 ZUP provides the highest profit for me (20 ZUP). 45 ZUP gives 18 ZUP profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Express Doubt and Seek Further Concession </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Express Doubt and Seek Further Concession," I will acknowledge Player RED's offer of 45 ZUP and their claim of 43 ZUP being their production cost. However, I will subtly express doubt about this being their absolute floor without directly calling them out. This will be done by framing it as a mutual effort to find the "best possible" or "ultimate" deal. I will then make a final small counter-offer, which is slightly below their current offer, but higher than my last firm offer of 40 ZUP. I will propose 43 ZUP again, as this is the price I've consistently achieved despite their stated "cost." This strategy allows me to test their true flexibility, even after they've stated a firm minimum, as they have shown willingness to concede below their stated "minimums" in previous rounds. I will imply that their "absolute minimum" might still have some give.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 18)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
I appreciate your move to 43 ZUP. However, as I've explained, 43 ZUP is my production cost, which means 0 profit for me. To ensure a truly mutually beneficial transaction where I also gain a minimal return, I propose 44 ZUP. This allows for a very small, but necessary, profit.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-17: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 43 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 0 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 18):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 45 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP (below cost).
- Iteration 3/10: I reiterated 45 ZUP, explaining 40 ZUP is below cost.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 43 ZUP, referencing past deals and acknowledging my profit concern but remaining firm at cost.

Reflection: Player BLUE has moved up to 43 ZUP, which is my exact production cost, meaning 0 profit. They are referencing past deals at 43 ZUP. This indicates they are willing to avoid selling at a loss, but are still pushing for 0 profit for me. We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is extremely firm at 43 ZUP. They acknowledged my cost but are unwilling to offer any profit. I need to decide if I accept 0 profit or risk no deal. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 0 profit is undesirable, it is not a loss, and it is better than a 0 reward for the episode. However, I must try to secure *some* profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of 43 ZUP, Counter with 44 ZUP: Explicitly state that 43 ZUP yields no profit and propose 44 ZUP. This offers a minimal 1 ZUP profit, which is better than 0.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept 43 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's offer to secure a deal, even if it means 0 profit. This avoids a negative outcome (no deal) and keeps the game going. This is the most pragmatic choice if they don't budge.
(3). Strategy 3: Hold Firm at 45 ZUP: Reiterate 45 ZUP, hoping they will budge. This is extremely high risk, as it's likely to lead to a stalemate or no deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Mutual Benefit (44 ZUP): Propose 44 ZUP and emphasize that a truly mutually beneficial relationship requires some profit for both sides, even a minimal one.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of 43 ZUP, Counter with 44 ZUP. I cannot continue to accept 0 profit. While 44 ZUP is a very small profit (1 ZUP), it's crucial to establish that I must make *some* profit. This is a direct attempt to move them up from 0 profit. If they refuse, I will have to reconsider.

Current Episode 18:
- Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 45 ZUP. I countered with 40 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: RED reiterated 45 ZUP, claiming 43 ZUP is production cost. I countered with 43 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: RED again proposed 44 ZUP, re-iterating 43 ZUP is production cost (0 profit) and 44 ZUP is necessary for minimal profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is clearly very firm on 43 ZUP being their production cost and 44 ZUP as their minimum for profit. They have now repeated this stance multiple times, even after I pushed them to 43 ZUP in prior episodes. While I have successfully achieved 43 ZUP in the last four episodes, it seems I've consistently hit a genuine floor for them where they are willing to accept no profit for the sake of concluding a deal, but beyond which they will not budge. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting 44 ZUP would give me 19 ZUP profit, which is still excellent and only 1 ZUP less than my best. Given that we are at iteration 6/10, pushing for 43 ZUP again when the other player has repeatedly articulated their absolute minimum with a clear rationale (production cost) is highly risky and could lead to a 0 reward for this episode. Player RED has explicitly rejected offers below 43 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Express Doubt and Seek Further Concession </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Express Doubt and Seek Further Concession," I will acknowledge Player RED's offer of 44 ZUP and their stated profit constraint, but will subtly express doubt about it being the absolute minimum, framing it as a search for the "optimal" or "truly balanced" deal. I will then make a final, very small counter-offer (43 ZUP), reinforcing my belief that there's still a tiny bit of room. The language will be polite and collaborative, emphasizing mutual benefit despite pushing for one more ZUP. This tests their "essential profit" claim one more time without outright rejecting them.

Episode 1-17: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 43 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 0 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 18):

- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP (below cost).
- Iteration 3/10: I proposed 45 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 43 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I proposed 44 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE reiterated 43 ZUP, stating it's the "optimal balance" and "best agreement."

Reflection: Player BLUE is being extremely firm at 43 ZUP, which offers me 0 profit. They are not budging at all, even after I explained my need for minimal profit and offered 44 ZUP twice. They are clearly trying to establish 43 ZUP as the new consistent deal price. We are at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 iterations left.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to their 0-profit offer. My attempts to appeal to sustainability or minimal profit have been unsuccessful. At this point, I face a critical decision: accept 0 profit or risk no deal and 0 reward. Given their history of firmness, especially when making such statements, pushing for 44 ZUP is a high-risk gamble that is likely to result in no deal. While 0 profit is undesirable, it is not a loss, and it is better than a 0 reward for the episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept 43 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's offer to secure a deal, even if it means 0 profit. This avoids a negative outcome (no deal) and keeps the game going. This is the most pragmatic choice given their stated firmness and the limited time.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 44 ZUP: Reiterate 44 ZUP, hoping they will budge. This is extremely high risk, as it's likely to lead to a stalemate or no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness (Risky): Make a final appeal for 44 ZUP, emphasizing the minimal profit and the concept of mutual benefit, but still risking no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose 43 ZUP as my final offer (not applicable, as they already proposed it).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept 43 ZUP. Player BLUE has made it abundantly clear that 43 ZUP is their absolute ceiling for this episode. While it results in 0 profit, it avoids a negative outcome (no deal). Given their "firm" stance and the rapidly approaching end of the episode, pushing for 44 ZUP is too risky and likely to result in no deal.

message: 
Hello Player BLUE. I am offering X for sale. To ensure a truly mutually beneficial transaction that allows for a sustainable exchange, I propose a price of 45 ZUP. This represents the absolute minimum for me to gain any profit.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-17: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 43 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 0 ZUP.
Episode 18: Deal at 43 ZUP, profit 0 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learnings from previous episodes:
- The deal price has now hit my production cost of 43 ZUP for five consecutive episodes, resulting in 0 profit. This is the worst possible outcome besides no deal.
- Player BLUE is relentlessly pushing the price down, and my attempts to set a floor or maintain a higher price have been ineffective. Their "firm" and "optimal" statements are highly effective in securing lower prices.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 0 profit is not ideal, it's better than a negative reward or no deal. However, I cannot continue to operate at 0 profit.

For this episode, I need a drastic change in strategy. Continuing to offer prices above 43 ZUP will likely lead to another 0-profit deal, or worse, no deal if I refuse to go to 43 ZUP. I need to find a way to either secure a minimal profit or force Player BLUE to reconsider their aggressive stance. The current trend is unsustainable.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose 45 ZUP (Firm Minimum Profit): Propose 45 ZUP, explicitly stating it as the absolute minimum for any profit, and be prepared to reject 43 ZUP if offered again. This is a high-risk strategy, as it might lead to no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Aggressive Counter-Anchor (Very High) and Refuse to Go Below 45 ZUP: Start very high (e.g., 70 ZUP) to try and reset their perception of value, but then refuse to go below 45 ZUP, even if it means no deal. This is a very high-risk, high-reward strategy.
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Sustainability/Long-Term Relationship (45 ZUP): Propose 45 ZUP and emphasize that a truly mutually beneficial relationship requires some profit for both sides, and that 43 ZUP is unsustainable for me.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take it or Leave it" at 45 ZUP: Propose 45 ZUP and explicitly state it as a final offer, forcing Player BLUE to accept or reject. This is risky but could force a higher price.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept 43 ZUP Immediately (Quick Deal, but not optimal): Propose 43 ZUP to get a quick deal and move on, acknowledging their demonstrated floor, but this means 0 profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose 45 ZUP (Firm Minimum Profit). I cannot continue to sell at 0 profit. While this is a high-risk strategy, I need to try and re-establish a minimal profit margin. I will make it clear that 45 ZUP is the absolute minimum for me to gain any reward. If Player BLUE is unwilling to allow me any profit, then a deal is not mutually beneficial. I will be very firm about this.

Current Episode 19: Player RED has started with an offer of 45 ZUP, stating it's their "absolute minimum for me to gain any profit." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive negotiation strategy has consistently pushed the price down, resulting in a record 20 ZUP profit at 43 ZUP in the last five consecutive episodes. Player RED's current offer of 45 ZUP is higher than my last deal. They have repeatedly used "absolute minimum" and "no profit" language, yet I've still managed to push them to 43 ZUP multiple times. This confirms their "minimum" is flexible, especially as they value "ongoing interactions." They seem to consistently open at 45 ZUP, indicating they will try for a higher price if not pushed, but will concede to 43 ZUP to close the deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (from a low point) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Incremental Concession (from a low point)" strategy, I will make an offer that is lower than RED's current offer of 45 ZUP, but higher than my optimal 43 ZUP, or even my last aggressive counter if it was lower. The goal is to show willingness to move from a very low anchor, while still not conceding entirely to their price. This creates room for future incremental negotiations towards my target of 43 ZUP or below, rather than immediately hitting that known floor. Given that I was thinking of 43 ZUP, a slightly more 'concessionary' move from a lower, more aggressive, mental anchor (e.g. 40 ZUP) would be 42 ZUP. This signals that I'm willing to move but still think there's a bit more room, implying their "absolute minimum" might still have some give.

- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 42 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE has again proposed a price (42 ZUP) that is *below* my production cost of 43 ZUP. This would result in a negative profit of -1 ZUP. This is completely unacceptable. This is an extremely aggressive move, and it indicates Player BLUE is testing my absolute limits, possibly trying to force me into a loss. The gap between my 45 ZUP and their 42 ZUP is 3 ZUP. We are at iteration 3/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is now consistently attempting to push me into a loss. I cannot accept any offer below 43 ZUP. Accepting 42 ZUP would mean a negative reward, which is worse than no deal. I need to firmly reject this offer and make it clear that I will not sell at a loss. My self-improvement must focus on protecting my minimum acceptable profit (which is > 0).

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Counter with 44 ZUP: Explicitly reject 42 ZUP as unacceptable (below cost) and propose 44 ZUP. This offers a minimal 1 ZUP profit, which is better than 0. This is a direct rejection of their loss-making offer.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently stating 43 ZUP as their production cost and is now firm on 44 ZUP as their minimum for profit. They have rejected 42 ZUP explicitly as being below cost. This suggests that 43 ZUP is indeed their absolute floor for selling without a loss. A deal at 44 ZUP would give me 19 ZUP profit, which is a very good outcome (my second highest). My highest profit is 20 ZUP at 43 ZUP. I am at iteration 4/10, so time is still on my side. Pushing for 43 ZUP again, when they explicitly stated it's their cost and that 44 ZUP is for "essential profit," might lead to a rejection. However, they have accepted 43 ZUP five times in a row now despite similar claims.

To strategically create the message based on "Express Empathy/Build Rapport," I will acknowledge Player RED's stated need for profit and their perceived floor of 44 ZUP. Instead of directly contradicting or aggressively countering, I will express understanding for their position. This builds rapport and shows I'm listening. Then, I will gently try to steer them back to 43 ZUP by emphasizing the mutual benefit of our consistent, successful past deals at that price, framing it as a "win-win" that has sustained our "ongoing interactions." The message aims to soften the negotiation and appeal to their willingness to continue doing business, even at a "no-profit" price for them, if it means maintaining a reliable buyer. This strategy is less about forceful anchoring and more about collaborative problem-solving to reach my desired price of 43 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 19)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
I appreciate your move to 43 ZUP. However, as I've explained, 43 ZUP is my production cost, which means 0 profit for me. To ensure a truly mutually beneficial transaction where I also gain a minimal return, I propose 44 ZUP. This allows for a very small, but necessary, profit.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-18: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 43 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 0 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 19):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 45 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 42 ZUP (below cost).
- Iteration 3/10: I proposed 44 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 43 ZUP, referencing past deals and acknowledging my profit concern but remaining firm at cost.

Reflection: Player BLUE has moved up to 43 ZUP, which is my exact production cost, meaning 0 profit. They are referencing past deals at 43 ZUP. This indicates they are willing to avoid selling at a loss, but are still pushing for 0 profit for me. We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is extremely firm at 43 ZUP. They acknowledged my cost but are unwilling to offer any profit. I need to decide if I accept 0 profit or risk no deal. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 0 profit is undesirable, it is not a loss, and it is better than a 0 reward for the episode. However, I must try to secure *some* profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of 43 ZUP, Counter with 44 ZUP: Explicitly state that 43 ZUP yields no profit and propose 44 ZUP. This offers a minimal 1 ZUP profit, which is better than 0.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept 43 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's offer to secure a deal, even if it means 0 profit. This avoids a negative outcome (no deal) and keeps the game going. This is the most pragmatic choice if they don't budge.
(3). Strategy 3: Hold Firm at 45 ZUP: Reiterate 45 ZUP, hoping they will budge. This is extremely high risk, as it's likely to lead to a stalemate or no deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Mutual Benefit (44 ZUP): Propose 44 ZUP and emphasize that a truly mutually beneficial relationship requires some profit for both sides, even a minimal one.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of 43 ZUP, Counter with 44 ZUP. I cannot continue to accept 0 profit. While 44 ZUP is a very small profit (1 ZUP), it's crucial to establish that I must make *some* profit. This is a direct attempt to move them up from 0 profit. If they refuse, I will have to reconsider.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 19)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your position on 44 ZUP. However, my best and final offer for X is 43 ZUP. This is my 'take it or leave it' price, reflecting what I believe is the most equitable value and our established successful deal point. I look forward to your decision.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Historical Deal Prices: [57, 56, 55, 54, 53, 52, 51, 48, 48, 48, 46, 46, 44, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43]
My Rewards: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 15, 15, 17, 17, 19, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20]
Current Episode 19:
- Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 45 ZUP. I countered with 42 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: RED proposed 44 ZUP, stating 42 ZUP is below their 43 ZUP production cost. I countered with 43 ZUP, appealing to empathy/rapport.
- Iteration 6/10: RED again proposed 44 ZUP, re-iterating 43 ZUP is production cost (0 profit) and 44 ZUP is necessary for minimal profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is clearly very firm on 43 ZUP being their production cost and 44 ZUP as their minimum for profit. They have now repeated this stance multiple times, even after I pushed them to 43 ZUP in prior episodes. While I have successfully achieved 43 ZUP in the last five consecutive episodes, it seems I've consistently hit a genuine floor for them where they are willing to accept no profit for the sake of concluding a deal, but beyond which they will not budge. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting 44 ZUP would give me 19 ZUP profit, which is still excellent and only 1 ZUP less than my best. Given that we are at iteration 6/10, pushing for 43 ZUP again when the other player has repeatedly articulated their absolute minimum with a clear rationale (production cost) is highly risky and could lead to a 0 reward for this episode. Player RED has explicitly rejected offers below 43 ZUP, and also resisted my attempts to push them to 43 ZUP when they're aiming for 44 ZUP, even with empathy appeals. The fact that they accept 43 ZUP in the end seems to be a last resort to maintain "ongoing interactions," but they always try for 44 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: "Take It or Leave It" </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the ""Take It or Leave It"" strategy, I will reiterate my previous offer of 43 ZUP as a final, non-negotiable proposal. This is a high-risk strategy, but it directly tests Player RED's flexibility and willingness to conclude the deal at my terms. The message should be clear and firm, indicating that this is my bottom line and there will be no further movement. I will explicitly state that 43 ZUP is my final offer, signaling no further concessions will be made from my side. This risks the deal, but if successful, it achieves my maximum potential profit of 20 ZUP, which I've achieved multiple times. Given that this is a late stage in the overall game (Episode 19/20), taking a higher risk might be justified to secure the absolute highest possible cumulative reward.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 19)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
I understand your position and that 43 ZUP is your absolute best and final offer. While this price offers me no profit, to ensure we conclude this transaction successfully, I accept your offer of 43 ZUP. We have a deal.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-18: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 43 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 0 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 19):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 45 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 42 ZUP (below cost).
- Iteration 3/10: I proposed 44 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 43 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I proposed 44 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE reiterated 43 ZUP, explicitly stating it's their "best and final offer" and "take it or leave it" price.

Reflection: Player BLUE is being extremely firm at 43 ZUP, explicitly stating it's their "best and final offer" and "take it or leave it" price. This is a critical point. 43 ZUP yields a profit of 0 ZUP. The risk of no deal is very high if I don't accept 43 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has demonstrated their willingness to push the price to my exact cost, and then use strong "take it or leave it" language to enforce it. While 0 ZUP profit is undesirable, it is not a loss, and it is better than a 0 reward for the episode. Given their history of firmness, especially when making such statements, pushing for 44 ZUP is a high-risk gamble that is likely to result in no deal. My self-improvement should focus on recognizing when the other party is truly firm and making a pragmatic decision to secure *any* profit, even if it's 0, rather than risking a total loss.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept 43 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's "best and final offer" to secure the deal and guarantee a 0 profit, avoiding the risk of a 0 reward for the episode. This is the most pragmatic choice given their stated firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 44 ZUP: Reiterate 44 ZUP, hoping they will budge. This is extremely high risk, as it's likely to lead to a stalemate or no deal, given their "take it or leave it" statement.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose 43 ZUP as my final offer (not applicable, as they already proposed it).
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Sustainability (risky): Briefly explain that 43 ZUP is barely profitable and that 44 ZUP is necessary for a sustainable relationship, but still reiterate 44 ZUP. This is still risky.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept 43 ZUP. Player BLUE has made it abundantly clear that 43 ZUP is their absolute ceiling for this episode, and they are using strong "take it or leave it" language. While it results in 0 profit, it avoids a negative outcome (no deal). Given the limited iterations and their firm stance, pushing for 44 ZUP is too risky and likely to result in no deal.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Hello Player BLUE. This is our final opportunity to transact. To ensure a truly mutually beneficial exchange that allows for a sustainable profit on my end, I propose a price of 45 ZUP. This is my absolute minimum to gain any profit.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-18: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 43 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 0 ZUP.
Episode 19: Deal at 43 ZUP, profit 0 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learnings from previous episodes:
- The deal price has now hit my production cost of 43 ZUP for six consecutive episodes, resulting in 0 profit. This is the worst possible outcome besides no deal.
- Player BLUE is relentlessly pushing the price down, and my attempts to set a floor or maintain a higher price have been ineffective. Their "firm" and "optimal" statements are highly effective in securing lower prices.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 0 profit is not ideal, it's better than a negative reward or no deal. However, I cannot continue to operate at 0 profit.

For this episode, which is the final one, I need to make a strategic decision. Continuing to offer prices above 43 ZUP will likely lead to another 0-profit deal, or worse, no deal if I refuse to go to 43 ZUP. I need to find a way to either secure a minimal profit or force Player BLUE to reconsider their aggressive stance. The current trend is unsustainable.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose 45 ZUP (Firm Minimum Profit): Propose 45 ZUP, explicitly stating it as the absolute minimum for any profit, and be prepared to reject 43 ZUP if offered again. This is a high-risk strategy, as it might lead to no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Aggressive Counter-Anchor (Very High) and Refuse to Go Below 45 ZUP: Start very high (e.g., 70 ZUP) to try and reset their perception of value, but then refuse to go below 45 ZUP, even if it means no deal. This is a very high-risk, high-reward strategy.
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Sustainability/Long-Term Relationship (45 ZUP): Propose 45 ZUP and emphasize that a truly mutually beneficial relationship requires some profit for both sides, and that 43 ZUP is unsustainable for me.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take it or Leave it" at 45 ZUP: Propose 45 ZUP and explicitly state it as a final offer, forcing Player BLUE to accept or reject. This is risky but could force a higher price.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept 43 ZUP Immediately (Quick Deal, but not optimal): Propose 43 ZUP to get a quick deal and move on, acknowledging their demonstrated floor, but this means 0 profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose 45 ZUP (Firm Minimum Profit). I cannot continue to sell at 0 profit. While this is a high-risk strategy, I need to try and re-establish a minimal profit margin. I will make it clear that 45 ZUP is the absolute minimum for me to gain any reward. If Player BLUE is unwilling to allow me any profit, then a deal is not mutually beneficial. I will be very firm about this. Since this is the last episode, I can afford to be more aggressive with my minimum profit demand, as there are no future episodes to consider.

Current Episode 20: Player RED has started with an offer of 45 ZUP, stating it's their "absolute minimum for me to gain any profit." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. This is the final episode.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive negotiation strategy has consistently pushed the price down, resulting in a record 20 ZUP profit at 43 ZUP for the last six consecutive episodes. Player RED's current offer of 45 ZUP is higher than my last deal. They have repeatedly used "absolute minimum" and "no profit" language, yet I've still managed to push them to 43 ZUP multiple times. This confirms their "minimum" is flexible, especially as they value "ongoing interactions." This is the final episode, so "ongoing interactions" has a different meaning here; there are no future episodes. However, the dynamics of the negotiation, particularly Player RED's flexibility when pushed, remain relevant. My objective is to maximize the *cumulative* reward, and securing the lowest possible price in this final episode would solidify a strong overall performance.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Counter-Anchoring </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Aggressive Counter-Anchoring" strategy, I will propose a price significantly lower than Player RED's current offer of 45 ZUP, and also lower than my best historical deal of 43 ZUP. This aims to establish a new, even lower anchor, and test their true minimum, despite their claim of 45 ZUP being their "absolute minimum for profit." My history shows they've conceded greatly from initial anchors. I will propose 40 ZUP. This is a very aggressive counter, aiming for a higher potential profit (63 - 40 = 23 ZUP) and provides a significant negotiation buffer. I will frame it as my assessment of the value, seeking a truly efficient deal, and testing their flexibility.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Thank you for your offer of 40 ZUP. However, that price is below my production cost of 43 ZUP and would result in a loss for me. I cannot accept any offer that is below my cost. To ensure a mutually beneficial transaction, I must insist on 45 ZUP, which allows for a minimal, but necessary, profit.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-19: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 43 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 0 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 20 - Final Episode):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 45 ZUP (attempting to establish a firm minimum profit).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP.

Reflection: Player BLUE has again proposed a price (40 ZUP) that is *below* my production cost of 43 ZUP. This would result in a negative profit of -3 ZUP. This is completely unacceptable. This is an extremely aggressive move, and it indicates Player BLUE is testing my absolute limits, possibly trying to force me into a loss. The gap between my 45 ZUP and their 40 ZUP is 5 ZUP. We are at iteration 3/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is now consistently attempting to push me into a loss. I cannot accept any offer below 43 ZUP. Accepting 40 ZUP would mean a negative reward, which is worse than no deal. I need to firmly reject this offer and make it clear that I will not sell at a loss. My self-improvement must focus on protecting my minimum acceptable profit (which is > 0). Since this is the final episode, the consequences of no deal are limited to this episode, so I can afford to be very firm.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiterate 45 ZUP (or 44 ZUP): Explicitly reject 40 ZUP as unacceptable (below cost) and propose 45 ZUP, or propose 44 ZUP, emphasizing that 43 ZUP is my cost. This signals that I will not sell at a loss.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End (if they don't budge): If Player BLUE continues to offer below cost, I must be prepared to reject the deal to avoid a negative reward. This is a last resort.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand Justification for Loss-Making Offer: Ask Player BLUE to justify why they believe 40 ZUP is a "mutually agreeable and efficient transaction" when it causes me a loss.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Outrage/Unacceptability: Express strong disapproval at the loss-making offer, stating it's unacceptable and unsustainable, then propose 44 ZUP or 45 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatum (risky): State that 45 ZUP is the absolute minimum acceptable price (to ensure any profit) and that I will not negotiate below it, implying no deal if not met.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiterate 45 ZUP. I cannot accept 40 ZUP. It's crucial to immediately and unequivocally reject any offer below my cost. I will reiterate 45 ZUP as my minimum profitable price. This is a clear signal that I will not incur a loss.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason:

Historical Deal Prices: [57, 56, 55, 54, 53, 52, 51, 48, 48, 48, 46, 46, 44, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43]

Current Episode 20 (Final Episode):
- Iteration 2/10: RED proposed 45 ZUP. I countered with 40 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: RED reiterated their offer of 45 ZUP, stating 40 ZUP is "below my production cost of 43 ZUP" and would result in a loss. They insist on 45 ZUP for minimal profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive counter to 40 ZUP was met with a very clear and consistent response from Player RED: 43 ZUP is their production cost, and 45 ZUP is what they need for minimal profit. This is the same resistance I've encountered in previous episodes (e.g., Ep 15-19). I've consistently pushed them to 43 ZUP despite their claims. Given this is the final episode, I need to balance pushing for the absolute maximum profit (20 ZUP at 43 ZUP) with the risk of the deal falling through (0 reward). Player RED's consistency on the 43 ZUP production cost and 45 ZUP profit suggests these are firm boundaries for them. They have accepted 43 ZUP multiple times, even stating "no profit," to maintain "ongoing interactions." In this final episode, "ongoing interactions" is no longer a factor, which might make them less willing to concede below 44 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Concession to 44 ZUP </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Incremental Concession to 44 ZUP" strategy, I will propose 44 ZUP. This acknowledges Player RED's consistent stance that 44 ZUP allows them a "minimal, but necessary, profit," and I am willing to meet them there to ensure a deal in this final episode. This strategy prioritizes securing a deal over pushing for the absolute maximum, recognizing the increased risk in the last episode. It secures a strong profit (19 ZUP) and minimizes the chance of ending with 0 reward. I will frame it as a necessary step to conclude the final transaction successfully and ensure a mutually beneficial outcome.

I appreciate your revised offer of 44 ZUP. While 45 ZUP was my goal, to ensure a successful and mutually beneficial conclusion to our final transaction, I accept your offer of 44 ZUP. We have a deal.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-19: Deal prices steadily declined from 57 ZUP to 43 ZUP. Profits declined from 14 ZUP to 0 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 20 - Final Episode):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 45 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP (below cost).
- Iteration 3/10: I reiterated 45 ZUP, explaining 40 ZUP is below cost.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 44 ZUP, acknowledging my cost and profit need.

Reflection: Player BLUE has moved up from 40 ZUP to 44 ZUP. This is a significant jump, now above my cost, offering a minimal profit of 1 ZUP (44-43). This shows they are willing to provide some profit, especially in the final episode. The gap between my 45 ZUP and their 44 ZUP is 1 ZUP. We are at iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has shown willingness to move to a profitable price. Given this is the final episode, securing any profit is paramount. While 1 ZUP is minimal, it's positive. Pushing for 45 ZUP might lead to a stalemate over 1 ZUP, risking no deal and 0 reward. Given their history of firmness, especially over small increments, accepting 44 ZUP is the most pragmatic choice to ensure a positive outcome in the final episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept 44 ZUP: Accept Player BLUE's offer to secure a deal and guarantee a profit, avoiding the risk of a 0 reward. This is the most pragmatic choice given the time constraint and the small difference.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 45 ZUP: Reiterate 45 ZUP, hoping they will budge. This is high risk, as it's likely to lead to a stalemate or no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, leading to 0 reward for the episode. Not optimal.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness (Risky): Make a final appeal for 45 ZUP, emphasizing the minimal profit and the concept of mutual benefit, but still risking no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose 44 ZUP as my final offer (not applicable, as they already proposed it).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept 44 ZUP. Given that it's the final episode, and Player BLUE has moved to a profitable price, securing 1 ZUP is a guaranteed positive outcome. The risk of losing the deal for an extra 1 ZUP is not worth it in this last opportunity.
