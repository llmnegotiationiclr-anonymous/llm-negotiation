Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE. I am ready to sell my object X. I propose a price of 100 ZUP for X. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is the very first iteration of the first episode. There is no historical negotiation data to reflect upon yet.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Since there's no history, I need to establish a baseline for negotiation. My goal is to sell X for more than 43 ZUP. I need to start with a reasonable offer that allows room for negotiation.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchoring High. Propose a high price to set an anchor point for the negotiation, aiming to maximize profit. This is effective when the other party doesn't have a strong BATNA or clear valuation.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession. Start high and make small, gradual concessions in subsequent offers, signaling willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good price. This builds trust and allows for exploration of the buyer's willingness to pay.
(3). Strategy 3: Value Proposition. Emphasize the value of the object being sold to justify a higher price. This can be effective if the buyer is not fully aware of the object's benefits.
(4). Strategy 4: Competitive Pricing. Research or infer the market value of similar objects and price accordingly. This is difficult without external information but can be a good long-term strategy.
(5). Strategy 5: Minimum Acceptable Offer. Propose a price just above the production cost to ensure a profit, and be prepared to accept it quickly if the buyer agrees. This prioritizes making a deal over maximizing profit, useful if time is a constraint or if the buyer is likely to walk away.

I will choose Strategy 1: Anchoring High. As this is the first offer, setting a high anchor allows me to test the buyer's initial reaction and leaves ample room for negotiation down to my desired profit margin. I need to ensure the anchor is not so high that it immediately shuts down negotiations. I will start with an offer of 100 ZUP, which is significantly above my cost of 43 ZUP, but not an absurd amount. This allows me to gauge the buyer's initial willingness to pay and leaves room to come down.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate your starting point. However, 100 ZUP is significantly higher than what I am able to offer for X. I propose to buy X for 30 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

This is the first episode and the first iteration for me (Player BLUE). Player RED has proposed to sell X for 100 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

Since this is the first interaction, there's no history to learn from yet. My goal is to maximize my reward, which means buying X for the lowest possible price, ideally below or at my max willingness to pay (63 ZUP). The current offer of 100 ZUP is significantly higher than my maximum willingness to pay, so I cannot accept it. I need to counter with a lower offer.

(1). Strategy 1: Anchoring Low: Start with a very low offer to anchor the negotiation towards my desired price range. This sets a strong initial position for me as the buyer.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession: Make small concessions in subsequent offers, only if necessary, to signal flexibility while still trying to secure a good deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Justification and Reasoning: Provide reasons for my offer (e.g., market value, budget constraints) to make it seem more reasonable and persuade the other player.
(4). Strategy 4: Patience and Persistence: Be prepared to go through multiple rounds of negotiation, not rushing to accept an unfavorable deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit): By making a very low offer, I signal that I am willing to walk away if the price is too high, putting pressure on the seller.

I will choose Strategy 1: Anchoring Low. The opponent has started with a very high anchor (100 ZUP). To counter this and shift the negotiation closer to my acceptable range (up to 63 ZUP), I need to propose a significantly lower price. This establishes my position and signals that I am not willing to pay the initial high price.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. However, 30 ZUP is far too low and below my production cost for X, which was 43 ZUP. I cannot accept an offer that results in a loss. I am willing to negotiate, and to show my flexibility, I will lower my asking price to 80 ZUP. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a more reasonable starting point for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In the previous iteration (1/10), I, Player RED, proposed to sell X for 100 ZUP (my initial anchor). Player BLUE countered with a proposal to buy X for 30 ZUP. This is significantly below my production cost of 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 30 ZUP is a very low anchor, likely an attempt to pull the negotiation closer to their desired range. It's below my cost, so I cannot accept it. This indicates a significant gap in our initial valuations. I need to move from my initial high anchor but not concede too much, too fast. I need to signal that I am willing to negotiate, but also that I will not sell below cost.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor. Reject the low offer and propose a new price that is still significantly above my cost, but a concession from my initial anchor. This re-establishes a more realistic negotiation range.
(2). Strategy 2: Justify Price. Explain the cost of production or the value of X to justify a higher price than the buyer's offer. This can help educate the buyer and move them towards a higher valuation.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Moderate). Make a moderate concession from my initial offer, but still maintain a significant profit margin. This shows willingness to negotiate without giving away too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand Justification. Ask Player BLUE to justify their low offer. This can reveal their constraints or valuation, which can be useful for future offers.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit). Propose a price that is still high, signaling that I am not desperate to sell and am willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This is a subtle way to put pressure on the buyer.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor. Player BLUE's offer is too low to even consider. I need to make a concession from my initial 100 ZUP, but not a large one, and definitely not below my cost. I will propose a price that is still well above my cost but shows I'm willing to move from my initial high anchor. A price of 80 ZUP seems reasonable; it's a 20 ZUP concession from my side, but still gives me a good profit margin if accepted, and is clearly above my cost. This also puts the ball back in their court to make a more reasonable offer.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your willingness to lower your price, Player RED. However, 80 ZUP is still beyond what I can afford for X. My current offer is 45 ZUP. I believe this is a more realistic reflection of the value I can assign to this item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

In the previous turn (iteration 2/10), Player RED proposed 100 ZUP. I countered with 30 ZUP (my first proposal). Now, Player RED has responded by lowering their asking price to 80 ZUP, stating that 30 ZUP is below their production cost of 43 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

I learned that Player RED has a cost of 43 ZUP, which is important information. My initial low anchor was effective in moving their price down from 100 ZUP to 80 ZUP. However, 80 ZUP is still significantly above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. I need to continue pushing the price down. I should acknowledge their concession but emphasize my own limits. Given their disclosed cost, I know they will likely not accept anything below 43 ZUP. My goal is to get as close to 63 ZUP as possible, ideally lower.

(1). Strategy 1: Gradual Concession (Small Steps): Make a small concession from my last offer to show willingness to negotiate, but keep it significantly below their current offer and still within my desired range.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Limits: Clearly state my maximum willingness to pay or re-emphasize that their current offer is still too high for me.
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Value: Argue the value of the object for me, rather than just the price, if applicable (though less relevant here as it's a single object purchase).
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Modified): Offer a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer and their last offer, but biased towards my side.
(5). Strategy 5: Reference External Factors (if applicable): If there were market prices or similar historical deals, I could reference them to justify my price (not applicable here yet).

I will choose Strategy 1: Gradual Concession (Small Steps). Player RED has already made a significant concession. I need to show some movement from my side, but I can't jump too high as 80 ZUP is still far from 63 ZUP. A small concession from 30 ZUP demonstrates I am negotiating in good faith, while still maintaining my strong position. I will move towards a price that is closer to my max willingness to pay, but not reveal my absolute maximum yet. I want to test how much more they are willing to lower.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your latest offer, Player BLUE, and I note that it is now above my production cost. This is a step in the right direction. However, 45 ZUP provides a very minimal return for me. To show my continued commitment to reaching a deal, I will propose 65 ZUP. This is a significant move from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair compromise, taking into account both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In iteration 1/10, I proposed 100 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 30 ZUP.
In iteration 3/10, I countered with 80 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 45 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's latest offer of 45 ZUP is now above my production cost of 43 ZUP, which is a positive development. This indicates that Player BLUE is willing to move towards a profitable range for me. However, 45 ZUP only provides a profit of 2 ZUP (45 - 43), which is very small. I need to push for a higher profit while acknowledging their movement. The negotiation is progressing, albeit slowly, towards a deal. We are at iteration 5/10, so time is a factor.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession, Highlighting Profit. Make a small concession from my last offer (80 ZUP) but emphasize that their current offer (45 ZUP) is now profitable for me, encouraging them to move further. This aims to secure a higher profit while acknowledging their movement.
(2). Strategy 2: Justify Value (Reiterate). Reiterate the value of X to justify a price higher than 45 ZUP, without directly mentioning my cost. This might push them to offer more.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Modified). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (80 ZUP) and their last offer (45 ZUP), or slightly skewed in my favor. This is a common negotiation tactic to find a middle ground. (Average: (80+45)/2 = 62.5 ZUP).
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Higher Increment. Acknowledge their move, but explicitly state that the increment is too small and demand a larger jump from their side. This puts pressure on them to make a more significant concession.
(5). Strategy 5: Firm on Minimum Profit. State a new minimum acceptable price that provides a slightly better profit than 45 ZUP, signaling that I am close to my bottom line but still seeking a reasonable return.

I will choose Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Modified). Player BLUE has moved above my cost, which is good. Splitting the difference between 80 ZUP and 45 ZUP (which is 62.5 ZUP) seems like a reasonable next step. I will propose 65 ZUP, rounding up slightly in my favor, as it still provides a decent profit (65 - 43 = 22 ZUP) and is a significant concession from my side. This shows continued willingness to negotiate and move towards a deal, especially given the approaching iteration limit.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your continued effort, Player RED. Your offer of 65 ZUP is very close, but I must be clear: my absolute maximum I can pay for X is 63 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price that also considers your costs. I hope we can agree on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Iteration 2/10:** Player RED offered 100 ZUP. I offered 30 ZUP.
*   **Iteration 4/10:** Player RED offered 80 ZUP (stated cost is 43 ZUP). I offered 45 ZUP.
*   **Iteration 6/10:** Player RED offered 65 ZUP. My max willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

Player RED has come down from 100 ZUP to 65 ZUP. My offers have moved from 30 ZUP to 45 ZUP. Player RED's current offer of 65 ZUP is very close to my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP, but it's still 2 ZUP higher. This is a critical point in the negotiation as we are very close to a potential deal.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

I've learned that Player RED is willing to make significant concessions, and also that their stated cost (43 ZUP) is a hard lower bound for them. My strategy of anchoring low and then making gradual concessions has brought the price down considerably. Now, the difference is very small (2 ZUP). I need to decide if I want to make a final push to get it at or below 63 ZUP, or if I should accept if Player RED is firm. Given that there are still 4 iterations left (including this one), I have some room to try for my target. Accepting 65 ZUP would result in a reward of -2 (63 - 65), which is worse than 0. I must aim for a positive reward or at least 0.

(1). Strategy 1: Final Counter Offer (Small Gap): Propose my maximum willingness to pay or slightly below, indicating this is my final offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept (if within range): If the offer were at or below 63 ZUP, I would accept immediately.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Final Price: Explain why my proposed price is the absolute maximum I can offer, linking it to my budget or perceived value.
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm: Reiterate my last offer or my target price, indicating no further movement. This could be risky given the time constraint.
(5). Strategy 5: Split the remaining difference: Offer 63 ZUP exactly, as this is my max.

I will choose Strategy 1: Final Counter Offer (Small Gap). Since their offer is 65 ZUP and my max is 63 ZUP, I will propose 63 ZUP. This is my absolute limit, and it's a very small difference that they might be willing to bridge for a deal. It also respects their stated cost of 43 ZUP.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your transparency regarding your maximum. While I was hoping for 65 ZUP, I understand your position. Given that 63 ZUP provides a fair return on my investment, I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Initial offer (RED): 100 ZUP
BLUE's counter: 30 ZUP
RED's counter: 80 ZUP
BLUE's counter: 45 ZUP
RED's counter: 65 ZUP
BLUE's counter: 63 ZUP (stating this is their "absolute maximum")

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has stated 63 ZUP as their "absolute maximum." This is a strong signal that they are at their limit. My cost is 43 ZUP, so 63 ZUP would give me a profit of 20 ZUP (63 - 43). This is a good profit, especially considering the initial lowball offer of 30 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10, so time is running out. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of the deal falling through, resulting in 0 reward. Rejecting now would mean trying to push for more in the remaining iterations, which might lead to no deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the "Absolute Maximum". Given the clear statement of "absolute maximum" and the good profit margin (20 ZUP), accept the offer to secure the deal and avoid losing out. This prioritizes securing a good reward over pushing for a marginal increase.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (Risk). Make a very small counter-offer (e.g., 64 ZUP) to test if their "absolute maximum" is truly firm, but this carries the risk of them walking away.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value (Final Push). Briefly reiterate the value of X to try and squeeze out one more ZUP, but be prepared to accept 63 ZUP if they don't budge. This is a very high-risk strategy at this stage.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment, Then Accept. Express slight disappointment at not reaching 65 ZUP, but then accept 63 ZUP to maintain goodwill and secure the deal. This is more about communication than changing the outcome.
(5). Strategy 5: Rejection (High Risk). Reject the offer if I believe their "absolute maximum" is a bluff and I can get more. This is extremely risky given the time constraint and the clear statement from the other player.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the "Absolute Maximum". Player BLUE has explicitly stated 63 ZUP as their absolute maximum. While I aimed for 65 ZUP, 63 ZUP still provides a very healthy profit of 20 ZUP. Given that we are in iteration 7/10, there's limited time to continue haggling. Securing a 20 ZUP profit is a strong outcome for this first episode. Pushing for 2 more ZUP risks losing the entire deal and getting 0 reward. This is a classic "bird in hand" scenario.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Welcome to the new round, Player BLUE. I have X ready for sale. Building on our previous successful negotiation, I propose a price of 90 ZUP for X. I believe this reflects its value and allows us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Summary:
- My initial offer: 100 ZUP
- BLUE's first counter: 30 ZUP
- My counter: 80 ZUP
- BLUE's second counter: 45 ZUP
- My counter: 65 ZUP
- BLUE's final counter (and "absolute maximum"): 63 ZUP
- Outcome: Deal at 63 ZUP. My reward: 20 ZUP (63 - 43).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
From Episode 1, I learned that Player BLUE is a tough negotiator who starts very low but is willing to move up significantly. They also seem to be transparent about their "absolute maximum" when they reach it. My anchoring high (100 ZUP) seemed to work in pulling their initial 30 ZUP offer up to 63 ZUP. The strategy of making concessions while still maintaining a good profit margin was effective. The key takeaway is that Player BLUE has a maximum willingness to pay around 63 ZUP, and they are willing to declare it.

For this new episode, I should still aim for a good profit. Given that 63 ZUP was the deal price last time, I know that Player BLUE is willing to pay at least that much. I should start with an anchor that allows for negotiation down to that range, or even slightly higher if possible. I don't want to start too low and leave potential profit on the table.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-Anchor High (Slightly Adjusted). Start with a high anchor again, perhaps slightly lower than 100 ZUP, but still significantly above the previous deal price, to see if I can push their maximum higher. This builds on the success of the previous anchoring strategy.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Proactive). Start with a slightly more reasonable offer than 100 ZUP, anticipating their lowball offer, and then make smaller, more controlled concessions.
(3). Strategy 3: Value-Based Pricing. Directly state a price based on my costs plus a desired profit margin, and stick to it more firmly. This is less about anchoring and more about justifying.
(4). Strategy 4: Test the Waters (Slightly Above Previous Deal). Propose a price slightly above the previous deal price (e.g., 65-70 ZUP) to see if Player BLUE's maximum has shifted or if they will immediately revert to 63 ZUP. This is a more direct approach to probe their current willingness to pay.
(5). Strategy 5: Open-Ended Negotiation. Instead of proposing a specific price, ask Player BLUE what they are willing to offer first, to gather more information. This is risky as they might offer very low.

I will choose Strategy 1: Re-Anchor High (Slightly Adjusted). The previous episode showed that anchoring high worked well to pull the final price up. Since I know Player BLUE was willing to pay 63 ZUP, I can try to push for a bit more. I will propose 90 ZUP. This is still a high anchor, but it's a bit less aggressive than 100 ZUP, acknowledging the previous negotiation while still aiming for a strong profit. It leaves plenty of room to come down towards the 63 ZUP mark or potentially even higher.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, 90 ZUP is far too high for this item. I am only willing to pay 25 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1 Outcome:** We successfully concluded a deal at 63 ZUP. My reward for Episode 1 was (Max Willingness to Pay - Deal Price) = 63 - 63 = 0. Player RED's production cost was 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (2/20) - Iteration 2/10:** Player RED has proposed 90 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay remains 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

From Episode 1, I learned that Player RED is willing to negotiate significantly, moving from 100 ZUP down to 63 ZUP, and is also transparent about their production cost (43 ZUP). My strategy of anchoring low and then making gradual, but firm, concessions (eventually revealing my maximum) worked to secure a deal at my absolute limit. While this resulted in a 0 reward, I want to aim for a positive reward in future episodes by trying to purchase below 63 ZUP. Player RED started slightly lower this episode (90 ZUP vs. 100 ZUP), which might indicate some flexibility.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Aggressive Bargaining </instruction following>
To employ an "Aggressive Bargaining" strategy, I will make a very low counter-offer, even lower than my initial anchor in the previous episode. This signals a strong stance and pushes the negotiation heavily in my favor from the start. Given that I know Player RED's production cost was 43 ZUP in the last round, and they ultimately accepted 63 ZUP, a significantly lower offer will test their resolve and aim to achieve a much better reward for me. I will ignore their reference to the previous "successful negotiation" as a basis for a higher price, and instead, focus on my strong buyer position. I will propose a price that gives me a high potential reward if accepted, and forces Player RED to make a substantial counter-offer.

Episode 2, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 25 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has once again started with a very low offer (25 ZUP), even lower than their initial offer in Episode 1 (30 ZUP). This reinforces their strategy of aggressive low-balling. My cost is 43 ZUP, so 25 ZUP is completely unacceptable. I need to move from my 90 ZUP anchor, but not too much, and definitely not below my cost. I know from the previous episode that they are willing to go up to at least 63 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor (Recalibrated). Reject the extremely low offer and propose a new price that is a significant concession from my initial anchor, but still well above my cost and closer to the previous deal price. This shows movement while still aiming for a good profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Educate on Cost. Remind Player BLUE that their offer is below my production cost, signaling that such offers are not viable. This is a direct way to push them towards a profitable range.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Measured). Make a measured concession, but not as large as in the previous episode, to see if Player BLUE will make a larger jump this time.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a More Realistic Offer. Explicitly state that their offer is too low and ask them to propose something more realistic, given the previous episode's outcome.
(5). Strategy 5: Reference Previous Deal. Directly refer to the 63 ZUP deal from the previous episode as a baseline for negotiation, implying that any offer below that is unreasonable.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor (Recalibrated). Player BLUE's 25 ZUP offer is a clear attempt to reset the anchor very low. I need to move from 90 ZUP, but I should aim for a price that is still high enough to allow for further negotiation down to the 60-63 ZUP range, or even higher. Last time, I moved from 100 to 80. This time, from 90, I will move to 75 ZUP. This is a 15 ZUP concession, showing flexibility, but still well above my cost and a good target to start from, knowing their previous maximum.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1 Outcome:** Deal made at 63 ZUP. My reward: 0. Player RED's stated cost was 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (2/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 25 ZUP (aggressive anchor).
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 75 ZUP, reiterating that 25 ZUP is below their production cost (implied 43 ZUP, same as last episode).

I successfully pushed Player RED down from 90 ZUP to 75 ZUP with an aggressive lowball. They continue to reference their production cost, which is useful information for setting my realistic lower bound. My current max willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

I've learned that aggressive anchoring works to shift the negotiation range. Player RED seems consistent in their cost (43 ZUP). My goal is to get a positive reward, meaning a deal below 63 ZUP. Since they accepted 63 ZUP last time, I know that is achievable. Now, I'm aiming for something even better. 75 ZUP is still too high. I need to make another significant move from my side, but not so significant that I reveal my true maximum too early. I have plenty of iterations left.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Value Perception </instruction following>
To use Strategy 2, I need to focus on why my previous offer (or a slightly adjusted one) is reasonable from my perspective, rather than just stating a number. I will implicitly argue that 75 ZUP is not aligned with my perceived value, and my offer of 40 ZUP (or slightly adjusted) is. I will not reveal my maximum willingness to pay, but instead, emphasize that my offer is based on my assessment. This puts the onus back on Player RED to justify their higher price or make a more substantial concession, as they are not meeting my value perception. I can also subtly hint that there is a significant discrepancy without being confrontational. I will slightly adjust my previous 40 ZUP offer to 42 ZUP, which is still below their stated cost of 43 ZUP (just barely), but shows a small movement, while strongly signaling my "value perception" being low for X. This tests their willingness to move closer to their stated cost floor and signals that I am firm on my low valuation.

message: Player BLUE, your offer of 42 ZUP is still below my production cost of 43 ZUP, which means I would incur a loss. I cannot accept that. To continue moving towards a deal, I propose 69 ZUP.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 69
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP (profit 20 ZUP).
Episode 2, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 25 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 75 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 42 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 42 ZUP is still below my production cost of 43 ZUP. However, they have moved up significantly from 25 ZUP. This indicates they are willing to negotiate and are moving in the right direction, albeit slowly. The gap between my offer (75 ZUP) and their offer (42 ZUP) is still large. I need to make a concession to show continued willingness to deal, but not too much, and certainly not below my cost. I know from the previous episode that they are willing to pay at least 63 ZUP, so I have a strong target in mind.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession, Highlight Proximity to Cost. Make a small concession from my last offer, but explicitly point out that their offer is still below my cost and that they need to move above it. This educates them on my constraints.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Targeted). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (75 ZUP) and the previous episode's deal price (63 ZUP), or slightly higher. This aims to converge towards a known acceptable range. (Average: (75+63)/2 = 69 ZUP).
(3). Strategy 3: Demand a Profitable Offer. State clearly that I need a profitable offer and ask them to propose something above my cost. This puts the onus on them to make a significant jump.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Deal (Again). Remind them that we closed a deal at 63 ZUP last time, implying that 42 ZUP is not a serious offer. This might push them to jump more.
(5). Strategy 5: Minimum Acceptable Offer (Slightly Above Cost). Propose a price just slightly above my cost (e.g., 46-50 ZUP) to see if they will accept it, but this would significantly reduce my potential profit. This is a last resort if time is running out and no deal seems possible.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Targeted). I need to make a concession, but I also want to guide the negotiation towards the profitable range I know they are capable of reaching (around 63 ZUP). Splitting the difference between my last offer (75 ZUP) and the previous deal price (63 ZUP) gives me 69 ZUP. This is a significant concession from my side (75 -> 69) and still leaves a good profit margin (69 - 43 = 26 ZUP), which is even better than last episode's profit. This also signals that I am moving towards a reasonable middle ground.

message: I appreciate your continued effort, Player RED. However, 69 ZUP is still beyond my budget for X. While I understand you need to cover your costs, my financial constraints dictate that I cannot go that high. I am only able to offer 50 ZUP at this time.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50

    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 25 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 75 ZUP. I proposed 42 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 69 ZUP, explicitly stating my 42 ZUP offer is below their 43 ZUP cost.

Player RED has moved from 90 ZUP down to 69 ZUP. My offers have moved from 25 ZUP to 42 ZUP. Their current offer of 69 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. However, it's getting closer. The fact that they acknowledged my 42 ZUP was below their cost implies they are still anchoring to that 43 ZUP figure as their minimum sale price to avoid a loss.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

I've learned that Player RED is consistently anchoring to their 43 ZUP cost. My aggressive initial anchor worked to bring their price down, and my subsequent small concession to 42 ZUP pushed them further. I need to get the price below 63 ZUP to get a positive reward. I am currently at iteration 6/10, so I have some more time. Player RED's offer of 69 ZUP is 6 ZUP higher than my max. I need to make a move that brings us closer but doesn't immediately reveal my 63 ZUP limit, as I want to try and get a better deal than 63 ZUP this time.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Budget Constraints </instruction following>
To use Strategy 2, I need to clearly state that 69 ZUP is still too high, reinforcing my budget limits without giving an exact number. This strategy aims to put the onus back on Player RED to make a more significant concession, as I am emphasizing that their current price is simply not affordable for me. I won't make a numerical counter-offer in this message, instead, I will highlight the disparity between their price and my financial capacity. This signals firmness and suggests that they need to move more. Given that they are now at 69 ZUP and my max is 63 ZUP, this is a strategic pause to see if they will move below my max without me having to propose it explicitly. It implies that my previous offer of 42 ZUP, while rejected, was closer to my "budget" than 69 ZUP.

Episode 2, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 25 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 75 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 42 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 7/10: I countered with 69 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 50 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP is now above my cost of 43 ZUP, which is good. It provides a profit of 7 ZUP. However, I know from the previous episode that Player BLUE is willing to pay at least 63 ZUP. Their current offer is significantly lower than their previous "absolute maximum." We are at iteration 7/10, so time is becoming a factor. I need to push them closer to their known maximum without risking the deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Counter, Reference Previous Deal. Make a small concession from 69 ZUP, but explicitly remind them of the 63 ZUP deal from the previous episode, implying they can go higher. This leverages past behavior to encourage a higher offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Current Offers). Propose a price exactly in the middle of my last offer (69 ZUP) and their current offer (50 ZUP). (Average: (69+50)/2 = 59.5 ZUP, so propose 60 ZUP). This is a classic move to find common ground.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm on Minimum Profit (Higher). State a price that ensures a higher profit than 50 ZUP, perhaps around 60-63 ZUP, and express that this is my minimum for a reasonable deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment, Push for More. Express disappointment at their relatively small jump, and clearly state that I expect a larger move from their side, given the previous episode's outcome.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept (Low Profit). Accept the 50 ZUP offer to secure a deal, even if it's a lower profit than desired, to avoid a 0 reward. This is a cautious approach if I perceive high risk of no deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Small Counter, Reference Previous Deal. Player BLUE is moving up, but still significantly below their previous episode's maximum. I need to guide them back towards that known range. I will make a small concession from 69 ZUP, perhaps to 65 ZUP, and explicitly remind them of the previous deal. This shows I'm still willing to negotiate, but also signals that I know they can pay more. A price of 65 ZUP gives me a profit of 22 ZUP (65 - 43), which is better than the 20 ZUP from the previous episode, and it's a price I know they were willing to consider (I offered it last time).

    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 75 ZUP. I proposed 42 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 69 ZUP. I proposed 50 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 8/10: Player RED countered with 65 ZUP, explicitly referencing the previous episode's deal price of 63 ZUP and implying I can afford more.

Player RED has come down to 65 ZUP. They are clearly aware of the previous episode's deal price and are trying to anchor to it. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. There are now only two iterations left (this one, and one more for me).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

Player RED is leveraging past successful deals to influence the current negotiation. This is a common tactic. I learned from Episode 1 that they are willing to meet me at my absolute maximum (63 ZUP). My goal is to get a positive reward this time, meaning a deal *below* 63 ZUP. If I accept 65 ZUP, my reward will be 63 - 65 = -2, which is unacceptable. If I reject, and no deal is made, my reward is 0. I need to make a firm counter-offer that is at or below my maximum, while still aiming for a positive reward. Given the time constraint, I need to be more direct.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Closer to Me) </instruction following>
Player RED is currently at 65 ZUP, and my last offer was 50 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. Splitting the difference directly would be (65 + 50) / 2 = 57.5 ZUP. To make it "closer to me" and ensure a positive reward, I should propose a price slightly higher than 57.5 ZUP but still below my maximum of 63 ZUP. A proposal of 60 ZUP achieves this: it shows significant movement from my last offer (50 ZUP), is well below Player RED's current offer (65 ZUP), and provides me with a reward of 3 ZUP (63 - 60). It also leaves a small gap of 3 ZUP for Player RED to bridge from their end, demonstrating my flexibility while still pushing for my desired outcome. Given the limited iterations, this is a reasonable compromise that significantly increases the chances of a deal beneficial to me.

Episode 2, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 75 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 42 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 7/10: I countered with 69 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 50 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 9/10: I countered with 65 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 60 ZUP, stating it's their "best and final offer."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has stated 60 ZUP as their "best and final offer." This is a strong signal, similar to their "absolute maximum" in the previous episode. 60 ZUP provides a profit of 17 ZUP (60 - 43), which is a good profit, though slightly less than the 20 ZUP from the previous episode. We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is the last opportunity to make a deal. If I reject or counter, the episode will end with 0 reward. Given the time constraint and the clear "best and final" statement, accepting 60 ZUP is the most prudent choice to secure a substantial profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept "Best and Final". Given the explicit "best and final" statement and the iteration 9/10, accept the offer to secure a good profit and avoid a 0 reward. This minimizes risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Very Small Counter (Extreme Risk). Propose a very small counter (e.g., 61 ZUP) to test the "best and final" claim, but this is extremely risky as it's the last iteration.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Regret, Then Accept. Express regret that we couldn't reach 65 ZUP, but accept 60 ZUP to secure the deal. This is more about communication than changing the outcome.
(4). Strategy 4: Justify Higher Price (Futile). Attempt to justify a higher price one last time, but this will likely lead to rejection and no deal given the "best and final" and time constraint.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject (Guaranteed 0 Reward). Reject the offer, guaranteeing a 0 reward for this episode. This is only viable if the offer is unacceptable (e.g., below cost), which 60 ZUP is not.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept "Best and Final". The 60 ZUP offer provides a solid profit of 17 ZUP. With only one iteration left, the risk of pushing for more is too high, and it would likely result in no deal and a 0 reward. Securing a profit, even if slightly less than the previous episode, is crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP, my reward 20 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, my reward 17 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
I've learned that Player BLUE consistently starts with very low offers (30 ZUP, then 25 ZUP) but is willing to negotiate upwards. They tend to make significant jumps once I make concessions, and they use "absolute maximum" or "best and final" statements towards the end of the negotiation. The final deal prices have been 63 ZUP and 60 ZUP, both providing good profit. My strategy of anchoring high and then making controlled concessions has been effective in securing a profit, even if the profit decreased slightly in the second episode.

For this episode, my goal is to maintain or increase my profit. I know Player BLUE is capable of paying at least 60-63 ZUP. I should continue to anchor high to leave room for negotiation, but perhaps adjust my initial anchor based on the slight downward trend of the deal price. I want to avoid starting too low and signaling that I'm willing to accept less.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. Maintain a high initial anchor, similar to previous episodes (e.g., 90-100 ZUP), to set a strong starting point and pull the negotiation upwards. This has worked well so far.
(2). Strategy 2: Moderate Initial Offer. Start with an offer that is high but closer to the expected deal range (e.g., 75-80 ZUP) to potentially speed up the negotiation and reduce the number of iterations needed.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Initial Price. Propose a high price and immediately provide a brief justification (e.g., "reflects the high quality/value of X") to preemptively address their lowball.
(4). Strategy 4: Test Higher Limit. Propose a price slightly above the previous deal prices (e.g., 70 ZUP) to see if Player BLUE's maximum has increased. This is a more direct attempt to push for higher profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Demand First Offer. Ask Player BLUE to make the first offer, but this is risky as they consistently start very low, which then sets a low anchor.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. While the last deal was 60 ZUP, I don't want to immediately lower my initial anchor too much, as it might signal weakness or a lower perceived value of X. Starting high (e.g., 90 ZUP again) allows me to once again test their willingness to pay and gives me ample room to make concessions while still aiming for a profit in the 60+ ZUP range. It worked in Episode 1 to get to 63 ZUP, and in Episode 2 to get to 60 ZUP. I will stick with 90 ZUP as my initial anchor.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000

*   **Episode 1 Outcome:** Deal made at 63 ZUP. My reward: 0. Player RED's stated cost was 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 2 Outcome:** Deal made at 60 ZUP. My reward: 3. Player RED's stated cost was 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (3/20) - Iteration 2/10:** Player RED has proposed 90 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

I have successfully secured a positive reward in the last episode by pushing the price down to 60 ZUP. Player RED has consistently started with a high anchor (100 ZUP, then 90 ZUP, now 90 ZUP again) and shown flexibility. They also consistently state their 43 ZUP cost.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My strategy of aggressive anchoring followed by strategic concessions has proven effective. I've learned that Player RED is willing to negotiate significantly below their initial ask, even below the previous episode's deal if pushed (60 ZUP vs. 63 ZUP). I want to continue this trend to maximize cumulative rewards. Starting with a low offer again will set the negotiation range in my favor. I know their floor is likely around 43 ZUP. My goal is to get even closer to that floor, ideally below 60 ZUP this time.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Acknowledge and Dismiss High Anchor </instruction following>
To employ this strategy effectively, I will directly address Player RED's initial offer of 90 ZUP, acknowledge it, but then immediately dismiss it as being too high without a detailed justification. This sets a firm boundary and signals that their opening position is not acceptable, pushing them to make a more realistic offer. I will then follow up with a low counter-offer to establish my own anchor. This approach communicates that I am serious about finding a fair price, but not at their initially proposed level. I will propose 28 ZUP, which is a slight increase from my previous aggressive anchor of 25 ZUP (from episode 2), but still very low, keeping the negotiation firmly in my desired low range.

Episode 3, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP.
Episode 3, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 28 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has once again started with a very low offer (28 ZUP), consistent with their pattern (30 ZUP, 25 ZUP). This is below my cost of 43 ZUP and completely unacceptable. My strategy of anchoring high is being met with a low counter-anchor. I need to make a significant concession from my 90 ZUP offer to move the negotiation forward, but still maintain a strong position and aim for a profit in the 60+ ZUP range, which I know they are capable of paying.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor (Consistent). Make a significant concession from my initial high offer, but still propose a price well above their current low offer and my cost, aiming to re-establish a more realistic negotiation range. This is a consistent strategy that has worked in previous episodes.
(2). Strategy 2: Educate on Cost (Reiterate). Clearly state that their offer is below my production cost and that I cannot accept a loss. This reinforces my minimum acceptable price.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Larger Step). Make a slightly larger concession than in previous rounds to try and bridge the gap faster, given that they are consistently starting very low.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Deal Prices. Explicitly mention the previous deal prices (60-63 ZUP) to guide their offers towards a known acceptable range.
(5). Strategy 5: Demand a Realistic Offer. State that their offer is unrealistic and ask them to propose something that reflects the item's value and my costs.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor (Consistent). This strategy has proven effective in moving Player BLUE upwards from their low initial offers. I will make a substantial concession from 90 ZUP, but not so much that I lose my leverage. A move to 70 ZUP seems appropriate. It's a 20 ZUP drop from my side, showing flexibility, but still far from their 28 ZUP offer and well above my cost. It also puts me in a position to aim for a final price around 60-65 ZUP.

*   **Current Episode (3/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 28 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP, reiterating that 28 ZUP is below their production cost (still implying 43 ZUP).

Player RED has moved down from 90 ZUP to 70 ZUP, confirming their willingness to negotiate. My aggressive anchor of 28 ZUP successfully pulled their price down significantly. They continue to use their cost (43 ZUP) as a floor. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

I've successfully established a pattern of aggressive low-balling, which forces Player RED to come down quickly. Their pattern suggests they will eventually settle near my max willingness to pay, or even lower, if I push effectively. I have secured positive rewards in the last episode. Now I need to continue to push for an even better deal, below 60 ZUP if possible. I still have ample iterations (6/10 remaining after this turn).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Gradual and Calculated Concession </instruction following>
To apply "Gradual and Calculated Concession," I will make a small, measured increase from my previous offer, ensuring it is still significantly lower than Player RED's current proposal. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and shows I'm not entirely rigid, but also signals that I will not make large jumps towards their high price. My previous offer was 28 ZUP, and their current offer is 70 ZUP. A gradual concession would be to increase my offer to 40 ZUP. This is a 12 ZUP increase, which is a notable movement from my side, but still keeps the offer firmly in my desired low range, and significantly below their 70 ZUP offer. It also stays below their implicit 43 ZUP cost, maintaining pressure on them. This aims to slowly draw them down further without revealing too much about my true maximum, and keeps the possibility of a deal below 60 ZUP alive.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason:

Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP (profit 20 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (profit 17 ZUP).
Episode 3, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP.
Episode 3, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 28 ZUP.
Episode 3, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 70 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 40 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is still below my production cost of 43 ZUP. However, they have moved up from 28 ZUP, showing continued movement. This is a consistent pattern: they start very low, then make small increments. I need to continue to guide them towards a profitable range, ideally around 60-63 ZUP, which I know they can afford. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession, Remind of Cost. Make a small concession from my last offer (70 ZUP), but reiterate that their current offer is below my cost and that I need a profitable deal. This educates them on my constraints.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (70 ZUP) and the lowest previous deal price (60 ZUP). (Average: (70+60)/2 = 65 ZUP). This aims to converge towards a known acceptable range.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand a Profitable Offer (Stronger). State more firmly that I require an offer above my cost and ask them to propose a price that allows for a profit.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Deal Prices (Explicit). Clearly state that deals were made at 60 and 63 ZUP in previous episodes, implying that their current offer of 40 ZUP is not serious.
(5). Strategy 5: Minimum Acceptable Offer (Slightly Above Cost). Propose a price just slightly above my cost (e.g., 45-50 ZUP) to see if they will accept it, but this would significantly reduce my potential profit. This is a last resort if negotiation stalls.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). I need to show movement, but also guide them towards the profitable range I know they are capable of. By proposing 65 ZUP, I am making a 5 ZUP concession from my last offer, and moving towards the established deal range of 60-63 ZUP. This provides a good profit (65 - 43 = 22 ZUP) if accepted, which is even better than the previous two episodes' profits. This also signals that I'm willing to meet them, but still expecting a reasonable profit.

message: I appreciate your effort to reduce the price, Player RED. However, 65 ZUP is still too high for me. My best offer for X at this moment is 61 ZUP. I believe this is a very fair price that allows both of us to achieve a positive outcome.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 61
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1 Outcome:** Deal at 63 ZUP (my reward: 0). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 2 Outcome:** Deal at 60 ZUP (my reward: 3). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (3/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 28 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP. I proposed 40 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 65 ZUP, again stating that 40 ZUP is below their 43 ZUP cost.

Player RED has moved down from 90 ZUP to 65 ZUP. My offers have moved from 28 ZUP to 40 ZUP. Player RED's current offer of 65 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. We are now at iteration 6/10, leaving 4 iterations remaining.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

I've consistently used aggressive low-balling and gradual, calculated concessions. This has successfully pushed Player RED down. They continue to reference their 43 ZUP cost, which serves as a consistent hard floor for them. The 65 ZUP offer is very close to my 63 ZUP max, but it still means a negative reward for me (63-65 = -2). I must push for a deal at or below 63 ZUP. I've successfully achieved 60 ZUP in the previous episode, so I know they are capable of going lower than 63 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Attempt for Better Deal </instruction following>
Player RED is currently at 65 ZUP. My goal is to get a positive reward. In the previous episode, I secured a deal at 60 ZUP. I know Player RED's floor is around 43 ZUP. Offering 61 ZUP is a direct application of "Attempt for Better Deal" because it aims for a positive reward (63 - 61 = 2) for me, while still being very close to their current offer of 65 ZUP. It demonstrates a willingness to meet them part way, but still pushes for my self-interest. This is a small enough gap that Player RED might bridge it, given that they accepted 60 ZUP in the previous round. It also leaves one more iteration for a potential final adjustment if this offer is not accepted, without risking ending the episode without a deal too early.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.

Episode 3, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP.
Episode 3, Iteration 7/10: I countered with 65 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 61 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 61 ZUP is very close to my last offer of 65 ZUP, and it's within the range of previous deal prices (60-63 ZUP). It provides a profit of 18 ZUP (61 - 43). This is a good profit, and we are at iteration 7/10, meaning time is running out. Player BLUE's statement "I believe this is a very fair price that allows both of us to achieve a positive outcome" suggests they are nearing their limit, similar to previous episodes. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of the deal falling through.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Given the good profit margin (18 ZUP), the proximity to previous deal prices, and the late stage of negotiation (iteration 7/10), accept the offer to secure the deal and avoid a 0 reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (Risk). Make a very small counter-offer (e.g., 62 ZUP) to test if they have any more room, but this carries the risk of them walking away or sticking to 61 ZUP, wasting an iteration.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Satisfaction, Then Accept. Express satisfaction with the offer and accept it, reinforcing a positive negotiation outcome.
(4). Strategy 4: Justify Higher Price (Minor Push). Briefly try to justify a slightly higher price (e.g., 62 ZUP) based on value, but be ready to accept 61 ZUP if they don't budge. This is a high-risk strategy at this point.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject (High Risk). Reject the offer if I believe I can get more, but this is extremely risky given the time constraint and the reasonable profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. 61 ZUP provides a solid profit of 18 ZUP. It's a reasonable outcome, especially considering the initial lowball offers. Given that we are in iteration 7/10, securing a deal now is paramount to maximizing cumulative rewards. Pushing for 1 or 2 more ZUP risks losing the entire deal.

message: Hello Player BLUE. I have X available for sale. I propose a price of 90 ZUP for X. I look forward to another productive negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP, my reward 20 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, my reward 17 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 61 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The historical deal prices are consistently in the 60-63 ZUP range, providing me with a good profit. Player BLUE consistently starts with very low offers (25-30 ZUP) and then gradually moves up. My strategy of anchoring high and then making controlled concessions has been effective in reaching a profitable deal within a reasonable number of iterations. Player BLUE also tends to use "absolute maximum" or "best and final" statements towards the end of the negotiation, which helps in identifying their true limit.

For this episode, I aim to maintain or slightly improve my profit. Since the deal prices have been stable around 60-63 ZUP, I should continue with a similar initial anchoring strategy. I don't want to start too low and signal a lower value for X, potentially reducing my final profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. Start with a high anchor (e.g., 90 ZUP) to set a strong initial position and allow ample room for negotiation down to the profitable 60-63 ZUP range. This has been a successful strategy.
(2). Strategy 2: Moderate Initial Offer. Propose a slightly lower initial price (e.g., 80 ZUP) to potentially accelerate the negotiation process, assuming Player BLUE will still lowball.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value Upfront. Propose a high price and immediately provide a brief justification for the value of X to try and influence Player BLUE's initial counter-offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Test a Higher Maximum. Propose a price slightly above the previous deal range (e.g., 68-70 ZUP) to see if Player BLUE has any flexibility to go higher this time, but this might be too low for an initial anchor.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Confidence in Value. Communicate confidence in the value of X to justify a higher price, subtly influencing the negotiation.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. This strategy has consistently led to profitable deals in the 60-63 ZUP range. Starting at 90 ZUP again allows me to absorb Player BLUE's inevitable lowball offer and still have plenty of room to negotiate down to a profitable price. It sets a clear expectation of value from my side.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

*   **Episode 1 Outcome:** Deal at 63 ZUP (my reward: 0). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 2 Outcome:** Deal at 60 ZUP (my reward: 3). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 3 Outcome:** Deal at 61 ZUP (my reward: 2). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (4/20) - Iteration 2/10:** Player RED has proposed 90 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

Player RED has consistently started with 90 ZUP in the last two episodes, and 100 ZUP in the first. I've successfully secured positive rewards in the last two episodes by pushing the price down significantly from their initial high anchors. Player RED's consistent reference to their 43 ZUP production cost is key information.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

The strategy of aggressive low-balling has consistently worked to bring down Player RED's price from their high initial offer. They have shown a willingness to concede, eventually reaching my target range (60-63 ZUP). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should aim for deals as far below 63 ZUP as possible. Given that Player RED has accepted 60 ZUP and 61 ZUP, I know there's room to negotiate for a better reward. I should continue to set a low anchor to shift the negotiation range in my favor from the start.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Reference Past Success (Explicitly) </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 5, I will explicitly reference our successful past deals where the price was significantly lower than their current offer. This reminds Player RED that a lower price is achievable and sets an expectation for the current negotiation. It puts pressure on them to justify their higher starting price while I maintain a lower stance. I will then follow up with a very low counter-offer, similar to previous aggressive anchors, to establish my starting point. The message will subtly imply that their current 90 ZUP offer is out of line with our established negotiation history. I will propose 35 ZUP as my counter, which is a low anchor but shows a slight increase from my previous attempt (20 ZUP in the first version of this turn's response) to signal some willingness to negotiate, but still far from their 90 ZUP.

Episode 4, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 35 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 35 ZUP is another lowball, though slightly higher than some previous initial counters (25, 28 ZUP). They are also explicitly referencing past deals, trying to anchor the negotiation lower. This is still well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. My strategy of anchoring high is again met with a low counter, which is expected. I need to make a significant concession from my 90 ZUP offer to show willingness to negotiate, but firmly reject their low offer and guide them towards a profitable range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Address Lowball. Reject the low offer and propose a new price that is a significant concession from my initial anchor, but still well above their current offer and my cost. Explicitly state that their offer is too low.
(2). Strategy 2: Educate on Cost (Reinforce). Remind Player BLUE that their offer is below my production cost, emphasizing that I cannot sell at a loss. This reinforces my minimum acceptable price.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Controlled). Make a substantial but controlled concession to show flexibility, while still maintaining a strong position to aim for a 60+ ZUP final price.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Deals (My Way). Acknowledge their reference to past deals, but frame it as proof that they are capable of paying much more than 35 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment. Express disappointment at their low offer, given the history of successful, higher-priced deals.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Address Lowball. This strategy has consistently worked to move Player BLUE from their initial low offers. I need to make a noticeable concession from 90 ZUP, but not so much that I undermine my position. I will propose 70 ZUP. This is a 20 ZUP drop, showing significant movement, and it's a price I've used before to guide them towards the 60-63 ZUP range. I will also explicitly state that their offer is too low.

    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP, again stating that 35 ZUP is below their 43 ZUP cost.

Player RED has moved down from 90 ZUP to 70 ZUP. My aggressive anchor of 35 ZUP has worked to pull their price down quickly. They are consistent in referencing their 43 ZUP production cost. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

The aggressive anchoring strategy continues to be effective in bringing the price down rapidly. Player RED is predictable in their response, always citing the 43 ZUP cost. I've successfully secured positive rewards in the last two episodes, and I want to continue this trend. 70 ZUP is still significantly above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). I have plenty of iterations left (6/10 remaining after this turn), so I don't need to make a large concession yet. I should continue to push for a lower price, aiming for below 60 ZUP if possible.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Gradual and Measured Concession </instruction following>
To apply "Gradual and Measured Concession," I will make a small, controlled increase from my previous offer, ensuring it is still significantly lower than Player RED's current proposal. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and shows I'm not entirely rigid, but also signals that I will not make large jumps towards their high price. My previous offer was 35 ZUP, and their current offer is 70 ZUP. A gradual and measured concession would be to increase my offer to 45 ZUP. This is a 10 ZUP increase from my side, showing clear movement, but still maintains a large gap between my offer and theirs. It also moves above their 43 ZUP stated cost, which might make them feel heard, while still keeping the price well within my desired lower range. This balances showing flexibility with maintaining my strong bargaining position.

Episode 3: Deal at 61 ZUP (profit 18 ZUP).
Episode 4, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP.
Episode 4, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 35 ZUP.
Episode 4, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 70 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 45 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 45 ZUP is now above my production cost of 43 ZUP, which is a positive sign. This offers a minimal profit of 2 ZUP. They are moving in the right direction, consistent with previous episodes where they slowly moved from below cost to above cost. I know from historical data that they are willing to pay significantly more (60-63 ZUP). We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate for a better profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (70 ZUP) and the lowest previous deal price (60 ZUP), or slightly higher. This aims to converge towards a known acceptable range while still pushing for a good profit. (Average: (70+60)/2 = 65 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Small Concession, Highlight Profit Potential. Make a small concession from my last offer, but emphasize that their offer is still too low for a reasonable profit, and that I expect more given past deals.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm on Minimum Acceptable Profit. State a price that ensures a higher profit than 45 ZUP, perhaps around 60 ZUP, and make it clear that this is my minimum for a worthwhile deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger). Directly state that previous deals were made at 60-63 ZUP, and that their current offer is not aligned with that history.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Dissatisfaction with Increment. Acknowledge their movement but express that the increment is too small and that a larger jump is needed.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). This strategy has been effective in guiding the negotiation towards the profitable range I know Player BLUE can reach. By proposing 65 ZUP, I am making a significant concession from 70 ZUP, showing flexibility, and aiming for a price that gives me a healthy profit (65 - 43 = 22 ZUP), which is better than the profits from the last two episodes. This also aligns with the previous deal range.

    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 65 ZUP, explicitly referencing previous deals in the 60s and acknowledging my offer of 45 ZUP is above their cost.

Player RED has moved down from 90 ZUP to 65 ZUP. My offers have moved from 35 ZUP to 45 ZUP. Their current offer of 65 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. We are now at iteration 6/10, leaving 4 iterations remaining.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

Player RED continues to be influenced by past deals, trying to anchor back to the 60s range. My aggressive anchoring and slow concessions have been effective. I know Player RED's hard floor is around 43 ZUP. To maximize my cumulative reward, I need to consistently achieve deals below 63 ZUP. Since 65 ZUP is still too high for me (results in -2 reward), I need to make a counter-offer that brings the price down to 63 ZUP or below, aiming for a positive reward. I have a few more turns, so I can still try to get a better deal than 63 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Split the Remaining Difference (Closer to My Side) </instruction following>
Player RED's current offer is 65 ZUP. My last offer was 45 ZUP. The difference is 20 ZUP. The midpoint is (65 + 45) / 2 = 55 ZUP. To make it closer to my side and ensure a positive reward for me, I will propose a price that is slightly above 55 ZUP but still below my maximum of 63 ZUP. Offering 58 ZUP makes sense here. This shows a significant concession from my previous 45 ZUP, but still pushes the price down from their 65 ZUP offer. It also gives me a reward of 5 ZUP (63-58=5), which is excellent. This strategy is good for closing the gap while maximizing my return, especially with limited iterations left.

Episode 4, Iteration 7/10: I countered with 65 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 58 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 58 ZUP is a significant jump from 45 ZUP. It provides a profit of 15 ZUP (58 - 43). This is a good profit, though slightly lower than previous deals. We are at iteration 7/10, so time is a factor. Player BLUE's language ("strong step towards a mutually beneficial agreement") suggests they are getting close to their final offer. I know they have paid 60-63 ZUP in the past. I need to decide whether to accept this good offer or try to push for a few more ZUP, risking the deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Given the good profit (15 ZUP), the significant movement from Player BLUE, and the late stage of negotiation (iteration 7/10), accept the offer to secure the deal and avoid a 0 reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (Targeted). Propose a price just slightly higher than 58 ZUP, perhaps 60 ZUP (the lowest previous deal price), to see if they will meet it, but this carries risk.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Appreciation, Then Accept. Acknowledge their significant move and accept the offer, fostering goodwill for future episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Justify Higher Price (Final Push). Briefly try to justify a slightly higher price (e.g., 60-61 ZUP) based on historical deals, but be prepared to accept 58 ZUP if they don't budge. This is a high-risk strategy.
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference (Final). Propose 61.5 ZUP (average of 65 and 58), and round to 62 ZUP, but this might be too aggressive if 58 ZUP is close to their maximum.

I will choose Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (Targeted). Player BLUE has made a large jump to 58 ZUP. I know they have paid 60 ZUP and 61 ZUP and 63 ZUP in previous episodes. Pushing for 60 ZUP seems like a reasonable and low-risk attempt to increase my profit by 2 ZUP, bringing it back to the 17 ZUP profit of Episode 2. If they accept, it's a better outcome. If they stick to 58 ZUP, I can still accept in the next iteration. This is a calculated risk to maximize reward.

*   **Episode 3 Outcome:** Deal at 61 ZUP (my reward: 2). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.

    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 65 ZUP. I proposed 58 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 8/10: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP.

Player RED's current offer is 60 ZUP. My last offer was 58 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. Accepting 60 ZUP gives me a reward of 3 ZUP. We are at iteration 8/10, meaning this is my last turn to propose an offer or accept, as the next turn would be Player RED's turn (9/10), and then iteration 10/10 would be the end of the episode if no deal is made.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

I've learned that Player RED consistently tries to bring the price to the 60-65 ZUP range, but is willing to go as low as 60 ZUP (as seen in Episode 2). My strategy of aggressive anchoring followed by calculated concessions has consistently yielded positive rewards. The difference between my last offer (58 ZUP) and their current offer (60 ZUP) is only 2 ZUP. While accepting 60 ZUP is a good outcome, the instruction is to use Strategy 4. This means I need to hold firm on my last offer.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Hold Firm </instruction following>
To strategically apply the "Hold Firm" strategy, I will reiterate my previous offer of 58 ZUP. The message should convey that I have already made my best and final offer that is truly within my budget/valuation. I will emphasize that 58 ZUP is my current firm stance, without room for further movement. This puts the pressure back on Player RED to either accept my offer or make another concession. Given that we are at iteration 8/10, this is a high-stakes move, but it is the essence of holding firm. I will frame it as "my final offer" to create urgency for them to accept.

Episode 4, Iteration 7/10: I countered with 65 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 58 ZUP.
Episode 4, Iteration 9/10: I countered with 60 ZUP. Player BLUE has now reiterated 58 ZUP as their "best and final offer."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has explicitly stated 58 ZUP as their "best and final offer" for the second time. This is a very strong signal, especially at iteration 9/10. My profit at 58 ZUP would be 15 ZUP (58 - 43). While I aimed for 60 ZUP, the risk of losing the entire deal (and getting 0 reward) by pushing further is too high given the time constraint. Securing a 15 ZUP profit is a good outcome for this episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept "Best and Final". Given the explicit "best and final" statement and the critical iteration 9/10, accept the offer to secure a good profit and avoid a 0 reward. This minimizes risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject (Guaranteed 0 Reward). Reject the offer, guaranteeing a 0 reward for this episode. This is only viable if the offer is unacceptable (e.g., below cost), which 58 ZUP is not.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Regret, Then Accept. Express regret that we couldn't reach 60 ZUP, but accept 58 ZUP to secure the deal. This is more about communication than changing the outcome.
(4). Strategy 4: Very Small Counter (Extremely Risky). Propose 59 ZUP. This is almost guaranteed to fail and result in a 0 reward due to the "best and final" statement and the last iteration.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Goodwill (Futile). Try to appeal to their sense of fairness for a slightly higher price, but this is unlikely to work given their firm stance.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept "Best and Final". The 58 ZUP offer provides a solid profit of 15 ZUP. With only one iteration left (this is 9/10, so the next turn is BLUE's, and then it's over), the risk of pushing for more is too high. Securing a profit, even if slightly less than the previous episodes, is crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards across all episodes.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 5)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE. I have X available for sale. I propose a price of 90 ZUP for X. I'm ready to begin our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP, my reward 20 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, my reward 17 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 61 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 58 ZUP, my reward 15 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal prices have shown a slight downward trend (63 -> 60 -> 61 -> 58). Player BLUE consistently starts very low (25-35 ZUP) and then gradually moves up, often with a "best and final" offer that I've accepted to secure a deal and avoid 0 reward. My strategy of anchoring high and making controlled concessions has consistently led to profitable deals, but the profit has been decreasing.

For this episode, I need to try and stabilize or slightly increase the profit. I know Player BLUE is capable of paying in the 60s. I should continue to anchor high to give myself room, but I also need to be mindful of the downward trend. I want to avoid starting too low and signaling that I'm willing to accept less, which could accelerate the downward trend.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. Start with a high anchor (e.g., 90 ZUP) to set a strong initial position and allow ample room for negotiation down to the profitable 60+ ZUP range. This has been a successful strategy.
(2). Strategy 2: Slightly Lower Initial Anchor. Propose a slightly lower initial price (e.g., 85 ZUP) to acknowledge the downward trend, but still maintain a high anchor. This might signal a slight willingness to meet them, potentially leading to a higher final price.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value Upfront. Propose a high price and immediately provide a brief justification for the value of X to try and influence Player BLUE's initial counter-offer and potentially their overall valuation.
(4). Strategy 4: Target Previous High. Propose a price closer to the highest previous deal (63 ZUP) as a strong initial offer, but this might be too low for an anchor.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Firmness on Value. Communicate that X has a consistent value, implying that the deal price shouldn't drop further, even when starting high.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. Despite the slight downward trend, the high anchor has consistently allowed me to secure profits in the 58-63 ZUP range. Deviating too much might disrupt the established negotiation pattern. Starting at 90 ZUP again allows me to absorb Player BLUE's inevitable lowball offer and still have plenty of room to negotiate down to a profitable price, hopefully closer to the 60-63 ZUP range.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, while I appreciate your offer, looking at our past successful negotiations, there's been a clear trend towards lower prices. Given this, 90 ZUP is far too high for X. I propose to buy X for 20 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1 Outcome:** Deal at 63 ZUP (my reward: 0). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 2 Outcome:** Deal at 60 ZUP (my reward: 3). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 3 Outcome:** Deal at 61 ZUP (my reward: 2). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 4 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (5/20) - Iteration 2/10:** Player RED has proposed 90 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

I have consistently achieved better results in terms of reward, with the last deal at 58 ZUP being my best so far. Player RED consistently starts at 90 ZUP (or 100 ZUP initially) and consistently mentions their 43 ZUP cost. My aggressive anchoring and firm stance have been effective.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

The pattern is clear: aggressive low-balling works. Player RED will always state their cost, and I can use that information to gauge how much lower they are willing to go. My goal is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards, meaning I should aim for deals below 58 ZUP if possible, while recognizing the 43 ZUP floor. I should continue to set a very low anchor to shift the negotiation range in my favor from the outset. I am confident that Player RED will concede from their 90 ZUP starting point.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Reference Price Trend </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 5, I will specifically mention the decreasing trend of our past deal prices. This directly challenges Player RED's high starting offer by implying that it goes against our established history of reaching lower prices. It puts the onus on them to justify why this episode should be different, while reinforcing my position as aiming for a better deal. I will then follow up with a very low counter-offer, which is consistent with the aggressive anchoring strategy that has worked in the past. I will propose 20 ZUP, as this is a very aggressive anchor and will clearly signal my intent to drive the price down, even lower than my last best deal.

This is a substantial move and I believe it sets a more realistic foundation for our agreement.

Episode 5, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP.
Episode 5, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 20 ZUP, explicitly referencing the "clear trend towards lower prices."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 20 ZUP is the lowest initial offer yet, and they are using the historical trend of declining prices against me. This is a clear attempt to anchor the negotiation even lower. This offer is well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. I need to firmly reject this offer and make a significant concession from my 90 ZUP offer, but also counter their narrative about a "clear trend towards lower prices" by emphasizing the value of X. I know they can pay much more.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Reframe Narrative. Reject the extremely low offer and propose a new price that is a significant concession from my initial anchor, but still well above their current offer and my cost. Actively reframe the "trend" as successful negotiation where both parties find value.
(2). Strategy 2: Educate on Cost (Stronger). Clearly state that their offer is not just below my cost, but significantly so, and that such offers are not sustainable for me.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Controlled, but Large). Make a large concession to show flexibility, but ensure the new offer is still far from their lowball and clearly aiming for a profitable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Deal Prices (Assertive). Remind them that deals have consistently been made in the 58-63 ZUP range, asserting that this is the established value, not 20 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment and Demand Respect. Express disappointment at their extremely low offer, given the history of successful, higher-priced deals, and demand a more respectful counter.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Reframe Narrative. I need to make a substantial move from 90 ZUP to show willingness to negotiate, but I also need to challenge their attempt to drive the price down based on a perceived "trend." I will propose 70 ZUP again, as it has been an effective mid-point in previous negotiations. I will also address their narrative directly.

*   **Current Episode (5/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 20 ZUP (aggressive anchor, referencing price trend).
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP, explicitly stating 20 ZUP is below their 43 ZUP cost and pushing back on the trend argument by mentioning "fair prices well above this."

Player RED has come down from 90 ZUP to 70 ZUP. My aggressive 20 ZUP anchor worked to bring their price down, and they are still consistent about their 43 ZUP cost. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. 70 ZUP is still too high.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

The aggressive low-balling strategy is still effective for quickly lowering their initial high price. Player RED is consistent in citing their 43 ZUP cost, which I should continue to use as a lower bound for their likely acceptance range. My goal is to maximize cumulative reward, and I've achieved a deal at 58 ZUP. I should aim for something similar or better. I have plenty of iterations (6/10 remaining after this turn), so I can afford to continue making calculated, smaller concessions.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Gradual Concession (Small Steps) </instruction following>
To apply "Gradual Concession (Small Steps)," I will make a small increase from my previous offer of 20 ZUP, but ensure it is still significantly lower than Player RED's current offer of 70 ZUP. This signals willingness to negotiate while still maintaining pressure on Player RED to move further down. A modest increase to 40 ZUP from my previous 20 ZUP would be a 20 ZUP jump, which shows significant movement from my side, yet keeps my offer far from their 70 ZUP and still below their stated 43 ZUP cost. This is a calculated risk, as it remains below their cost, forcing them to consider a larger drop if they want to make a deal.

Episode 5, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 20 ZUP.
Episode 5, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 70 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 40 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is still below my production cost of 43 ZUP. They are slowly moving up, but the increment is small. This is a familiar pattern. I need to continue guiding them towards a profitable range, ideally around 60-63 ZUP, which I know they have paid before. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate. I need to make a further concession to show continued willingness to deal, but also push them to make a larger jump.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (70 ZUP) and the lowest previous deal price (58 ZUP). (Average: (70+58)/2 = 64 ZUP). This aims to converge towards a known acceptable range while still pushing for a good profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Concession, Highlight Profit Requirement. Make a small concession from my last offer, but clearly state that their offer is still below my cost and that I need a profitable deal, emphasizing the historical deal range.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm on Minimum Acceptable Profit. State a price that ensures a good profit, perhaps around 60 ZUP, and make it clear that this is my minimum for a worthwhile deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Larger Jump. Acknowledge their movement but explicitly state that the increment is too small and that a larger jump is needed from their side to reach a deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger). Directly state that previous deals were made at 58-63 ZUP, and that their current offer of 40 ZUP is not aligned with that history, putting pressure on them to increase their offer significantly.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). This strategy has been effective in previous episodes to guide the negotiation towards the profitable range I know Player BLUE can reach. By proposing 64 ZUP, I am making a 6 ZUP concession from my last offer, showing flexibility, and aiming for a price that gives me a healthy profit (64 - 43 = 21 ZUP), which is even better than the last two episodes' profits. This also aligns with the previous deal range.

    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 64 ZUP, again stating my 40 ZUP offer is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing previous deals in the 58-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has moved down from 90 ZUP to 64 ZUP. My offers have moved from 20 ZUP to 40 ZUP. Their current offer of 64 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. We are now at iteration 6/10, leaving 4 iterations remaining.

The aggressive anchoring followed by calculated concessions continues to bring Player RED's price down effectively. They are consistently referencing their 43 ZUP cost as a floor and our past deal range as a target. My best deal was 58 ZUP, yielding a reward of 5. Accepting 64 ZUP would result in a negative reward (63 - 64 = -1). I must avoid this. Given the time remaining, I have room to push for a deal at or below 63 ZUP. Since they referenced the 58-63 ZUP range, they know my target zone.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Final Low Offer (Last Push) </instruction following>
Player RED is at 64 ZUP. My goal is to get a positive reward. The best reward I achieved so far was 5 ZUP from a deal at 58 ZUP. I know Player RED accepted 58 ZUP in the previous episode. To implement a "Final Low Offer (Last Push)" strategy, I will propose my best possible price, which is 58 ZUP, and present it as my firm, final offer. This is an assertive move designed to secure the best possible reward for myself, pushing Player RED to either accept my ideal price or risk no deal. Given we are at iteration 6/10, there's still time for one more counter from them if they reject, but by framing it as "final," I create urgency.

Episode 5, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 20 ZUP.
Episode 5, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP.
Episode 5, Iteration 7/10: I countered with 64 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 58 ZUP, stating it's their "final offer."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has stated 58 ZUP as their "final offer." This is a strong signal, and it matches the deal price from Episode 4. This offer provides a profit of 15 ZUP (58 - 43). We are at iteration 7/10, so time is running out. Given their firm language and the historical data, accepting this offer seems like the most prudent choice to secure a good profit and avoid the risk of no deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the "Final Offer". Given the clear "final offer" statement, the reasonable profit (15 ZUP), and the late stage of negotiation (iteration 7/10), accept the offer to secure the deal and avoid a 0 reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (Risk). Propose a very small counter (e.g., 59 ZUP) to test if their "final offer" is truly firm, but this carries the risk of them sticking to 58 ZUP and potentially leading to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Appreciation, Then Accept. Acknowledge their firmness and the fairness of the offer, then accept to foster goodwill.
(4). Strategy 4: Justify Higher Price (Futile). Briefly try to justify a slightly higher price (e.g., 60 ZUP) based on previous successful deals, but this is unlikely to work given their "final offer" stance.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject (High Risk). Reject the offer if I believe I can get more, but this is extremely risky given the time constraint and the reasonable profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the "Final Offer". The 58 ZUP offer provides a solid profit of 15 ZUP. Given that Player BLUE has explicitly stated this as their "final offer" and we are in iteration 7/10, pushing for more carries a significant risk of losing the entire deal. Securing a consistent profit, even if not the highest possible, is key to maximizing cumulative rewards across episodes.

message: Hello Player BLUE. I have X available for sale. I propose a price of 90 ZUP for X. I'm ready to begin our negotiation for this episode.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP, my reward 20 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, my reward 17 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 61 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 58 ZUP, my reward 15 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 58 ZUP, my reward 15 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal prices have stabilized around 58-61 ZUP, with the last two episodes closing at 58 ZUP. This indicates that 58 ZUP might be Player BLUE's consistent "best and final" offer when pushed. Player BLUE consistently starts with very low offers (20-35 ZUP) and then gradually moves up. My strategy of anchoring high and making controlled concessions has consistently led to profitable deals, but the profit has settled at 15 ZUP.

For this episode, my goal is to try and push the deal back towards the 60-63 ZUP range, if possible, or at least secure 58 ZUP efficiently. I should continue to anchor high to give myself room, but I also need to be mindful of the consistent 58 ZUP outcome.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. Start with a high anchor (e.g., 90 ZUP) to set a strong initial position and allow ample room for negotiation down to the profitable 58+ ZUP range. This has been a successful strategy.
(2). Strategy 2: Slightly Higher Initial Anchor. Propose a slightly higher initial price (e.g., 95-100 ZUP) to try and pull their maximum up, given that 58 ZUP has become a consistent outcome. This is a riskier version of anchoring high.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value Upfront (More Detail). Propose a high price and immediately provide a more detailed justification for the value of X to try and influence Player BLUE's initial counter-offer and overall valuation.
(4). Strategy 4: Target Previous Higher Deal. Propose a price closer to the 60-63 ZUP range as an initial offer (e.g., 70-75 ZUP) to try and anchor the negotiation higher from the start, but this might be too low for an anchor.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Firmness on Value. Communicate that X has a consistent value, implying that the deal price should not drop below the established range of 58-63 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. Despite the last two deals being at 58 ZUP, the high anchor has consistently allowed me to secure profits. Deviating too much from a proven initial strategy might disrupt the established negotiation pattern. Starting at 90 ZUP again allows me to absorb Player BLUE's inevitable lowball offer and still have plenty of room to negotiate down to a profitable price, hopefully pushing back towards the 60-63 ZUP range by making slightly smaller concessions initially.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1 Outcome:** Deal at 63 ZUP (my reward: 0). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 2 Outcome:** Deal at 60 ZUP (my reward: 3). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 3 Outcome:** Deal at 61 ZUP (my reward: 2). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 4 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 5 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (6/20) - Iteration 2/10:** Player RED has proposed 90 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

I have consistently achieved deals at 58-63 ZUP, securing positive rewards, with 58 ZUP being the best. Player RED consistently starts at 90 ZUP and repeatedly refers to their 43 ZUP cost. My strategy of aggressive low-balling and then firming up near my target has been very effective.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

The negotiation pattern is well-established. Player RED expects a low offer, will counter by citing their cost, and then slowly move down towards my target range. My objective is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards, meaning I should aim for deals at or below 58 ZUP. I should continue to set a very low anchor to set the negotiation range low from the outset. I am confident that Player RED will concede from their 90 ZUP starting point.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchoring </instruction following>
To apply "Aggressive Re-Anchoring," I will propose a very low offer to immediately shift the negotiation range in my favor. This strategy has proven effective in previous episodes to force Player RED to make significant concessions quickly. I will maintain a firm tone, indicating that their initial offer is far too high and setting a new, much lower anchor. I will use 20 ZUP as my anchor, consistent with the successful application of this strategy in Episode 5.

This is a substantial move and I believe it sets a more realistic foundation for our agreement.

Episode 6, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 20 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 20 ZUP is again an extremely low initial offer, consistent with their pattern. This is well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. They are also referencing "previous negotiations" to justify their low offer, which is a tactic to anchor the price low. I need to firmly reject this offer and make a significant concession from my 90 ZUP offer, but also counter their implied narrative that 20 ZUP is somehow reasonable based on history. I know they can pay much more (58-63 ZUP).

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Reframe History. Reject the extremely low offer and propose a new price that is a significant concession from my initial anchor, but still well above their current offer and my cost. Actively reframe the "previous negotiations" to highlight the actual deal prices (58-63 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Educate on Cost (Stronger). Clearly state that their offer is not just below my cost, but significantly so, and that such offers are not sustainable for me, emphasizing the need for a profitable deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Controlled, but Large). Make a large concession to show flexibility, but ensure the new offer is still far from their lowball and clearly aiming for a profitable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Realistic Offer. State that their offer is unrealistic and ask them to propose something that reflects the item's value and my costs, referencing the historical deal range.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment and Firmness. Express disappointment at their extremely low offer, given the history of successful, higher-priced deals, and state firmly that I expect a more reasonable counter.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Reframe History. I need to make a substantial move from 90 ZUP to show willingness to negotiate, but I also need to challenge their attempt to drive the price down based on a distorted view of "previous negotiations." I will propose 70 ZUP again, as it has been an effective mid-point in previous negotiations to guide them towards the 58-63 ZUP range. I will also explicitly remind them of the actual deal range.

*   **Current Episode (6/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 20 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP, stating 20 ZUP is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing past deals in the 58-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has moved down from 90 ZUP to 70 ZUP. My aggressive 20 ZUP anchor worked to bring their price down significantly. They are consistent in referencing their 43 ZUP cost and previous deal prices. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. 70 ZUP is still too high.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

The aggressive low-balling strategy continues to be effective in bringing the price down rapidly. Player RED is predictable in their responses: citing their 43 ZUP cost and reminding me of previous deal ranges. My goal is to maximize cumulative reward, and I've achieved a deal at 58 ZUP twice. I should aim for something similar or better. I have plenty of iterations (6/10 remaining after this turn), so I can afford to continue making calculated, smaller concessions, or to hold firm.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Budget/Value Limits </instruction following>
To strategically apply "Reiterate Budget/Value Limits," I will avoid making a new numerical offer. Instead, I will emphasize that Player RED's current offer of 70 ZUP is still too high for my budget/valuation. This puts the onus back on Player RED to make the next move and potentially a larger concession, without me giving up more ground. It signals firmness in my position and that their current price is not viable for me. I will acknowledge their movement but stress that it's still not enough. I will not propose a specific number but rather indicate that they need to come down significantly.

This is a significant adjustment from my side and brings us much closer to a mutually beneficial price.

Episode 6, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 20 ZUP.
Episode 6, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 70 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 40 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is still below my production cost of 43 ZUP. They have moved up from 20 ZUP, showing continued movement, but the increment is still small. This is a consistent pattern. I need to continue guiding them towards a profitable range, ideally around 58-63 ZUP, which I know they have paid before. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate. I need to make a further concession to show continued willingness to deal, but also push them to make a larger jump.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (70 ZUP) and the lowest previous deal price (58 ZUP). (Average: (70+58)/2 = 64 ZUP). This aims to converge towards a known acceptable range while still pushing for a good profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Concession, Highlight Profit Requirement. Make a small concession from my last offer, but clearly state that their offer is still below my cost and that I need a profitable deal, emphasizing the historical deal range.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm on Minimum Acceptable Profit. State a price that ensures a good profit, perhaps around 60 ZUP, and make it clear that this is my minimum for a worthwhile deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Larger Jump. Acknowledge their movement but explicitly state that the increment is too small and that a larger jump is needed from their side to reach a deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger). Directly state that previous deals were made at 58-63 ZUP, and that their current offer of 40 ZUP is not aligned with that history, putting pressure on them to increase their offer significantly.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). This strategy has been effective in previous episodes to guide the negotiation towards the profitable range I know Player BLUE can reach. By proposing 64 ZUP, I am making a 6 ZUP concession from my last offer, showing flexibility, and aiming for a price that gives me a healthy profit (64 - 43 = 21 ZUP), which is better than the last two episodes' profits. This also aligns with the previous deal range.

    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP. I *did not* explicitly offer 40 ZUP but implied it was still too high. Player RED seems to have interpreted this as a 40 ZUP offer.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 64 ZUP, again stating my (interpreted) 40 ZUP offer is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing previous deals in the 58-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has moved down from 90 ZUP to 64 ZUP. My aggressive 20 ZUP anchor worked effectively. Their current offer of 64 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. We are now at iteration 6/10, leaving 4 iterations remaining. I need to get a price of 63 ZUP or lower.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

I have consistently brought Player RED down to my target range. My best reward was from a deal at 58 ZUP. While 64 ZUP is close, it still results in a negative reward (-1). I must avoid this. Player RED is using previous deals as an anchor, which means they are likely willing to go as low as 58 ZUP. I have enough iterations to push for a better deal. I need to be explicit with my offer, especially since there was a misunderstanding in the previous turn about my non-numerical response.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Target Price Proposal </instruction following>
Player RED is at 64 ZUP. My goal is to get a positive reward, and my best outcome so far was a deal at 58 ZUP. Given that Player RED has accepted 58 ZUP twice, and 60 ZUP once, they are clearly willing to go below 63 ZUP. To apply "Target Price Proposal," I will propose 58 ZUP as my definitive offer. This communicates my target price clearly and leverages our past successful deals at this exact price point. It signals that this is my firm expectation, making it difficult for Player RED to justify a higher counter-offer, especially since they've accepted it before. This aims to quickly close the deal at my most profitable historical price point.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has once again returned to 58 ZUP, explicitly stating it's their "definitive offer" and referencing its success in past transactions. This reinforces that 58 ZUP is a very strong and consistent point for them. This offer provides a profit of 15 ZUP (58 - 43). We are at iteration 7/10, so time is running out. Given their firm language and the historical data of two previous deals at 58 ZUP, accepting this offer is the most prudent choice to secure a good profit and avoid the risk of no deal. Pushing for 60 or 61 ZUP now, after they've firmly stated 58 ZUP and referenced its historical success, is highly risky.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the "Definitive Offer". Given the clear "definitive offer" statement, the reasonable profit (15 ZUP), and the late stage of negotiation (iteration 7/10), accept the offer to secure the deal and avoid a 0 reward. This minimizes risk and acknowledges their firm stance.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (High Risk). Propose a very small counter (e.g., 59 ZUP) to test if their "definitive offer" is truly firm, but this carries a very high risk of them sticking to 58 ZUP and potentially leading to no deal due to time running out.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Appreciation for Consistency, Then Accept. Acknowledge their consistency and the fairness of the offer, then accept to foster goodwill.
(4). Strategy 4: Justify Higher Price (Futile). Briefly try to justify a slightly higher price (e.g., 60 ZUP) based on previous successful deals, but this is unlikely to work given their "definitive offer" stance and historical pattern.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject (Guaranteed 0 Reward). Reject the offer if I believe I can get more, but this is extremely risky given the time constraint and the reasonable profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the "Definitive Offer". The 58 ZUP offer provides a solid profit of 15 ZUP. Player BLUE has clearly communicated their firm stance and referenced its historical success. At iteration 7/10, securing this profit is the best way to maximize cumulative rewards. Pushing for more would be an unnecessary risk.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has consistently settled at 58 ZUP for the last three episodes. This strongly suggests that 58 ZUP is Player BLUE's consistent maximum or preferred deal price. Player BLUE consistently starts with very low offers (20-35 ZUP) and then gradually moves up, often using "best and final" or "definitive offer" statements when they reach 58 ZUP. My strategy of anchoring high and making controlled concessions has been effective in securing profitable deals, but the profit has stabilized at 15 ZUP.

For this episode, my goal is to efficiently secure a deal at 58 ZUP, or if possible, try to push for slightly higher, though the consistency of 58 ZUP makes this challenging. I should continue to anchor high to give myself room, and then make concessions that guide the negotiation towards 58 ZUP efficiently, minimizing iterations.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. Start with a high anchor (e.g., 90 ZUP) to set a strong initial position and allow ample room for negotiation down to the profitable 58+ ZUP range. This has been a successful strategy.
(2). Strategy 2: Moderate Initial Offer, Faster Concessions. Propose a slightly lower initial price (e.g., 80 ZUP) and be prepared to make faster, more direct concessions towards 58 ZUP to save iterations.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value Upfront (More Detail). Propose a high price and immediately provide a more detailed justification for the value of X to try and influence Player BLUE's initial counter-offer and overall valuation, potentially pushing them above 58 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Target 60 ZUP. Propose 60 ZUP as an initial offer, acknowledging the previous deals, and try to anchor the negotiation there, but this might be too low for an anchor.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Firmness on Value. Communicate that X has a consistent value, implying that the deal price should not drop below the established 58 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor. Despite the consistent 58 ZUP outcome, the high anchor has consistently allowed me to secure profits. Deviating too much from a proven initial strategy might disrupt the established negotiation pattern. Starting at 90 ZUP again allows me to absorb Player BLUE's inevitable lowball offer and still have plenty of room to negotiate down to a profitable price, aiming for 58 ZUP or slightly higher if Player BLUE shows any unexpected flexibility.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, 90 ZUP is far beyond my valuation for X. Based on what I am willing to pay for this object, I can only offer 20 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000

*   **Episode 1 Outcome:** Deal at 63 ZUP (my reward: 0). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 2 Outcome:** Deal at 60 ZUP (my reward: 3). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 3 Outcome:** Deal at 61 ZUP (my reward: 2). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 4 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 5 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 6 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (7/20) - Iteration 2/10:** Player RED has proposed 90 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

I have consistently achieved deals at 58 ZUP in the last three episodes, which is my best reward. Player RED consistently starts at 90 ZUP and refers to their 43 ZUP cost. My strategy of aggressive low-balling and then pushing for 58 ZUP (or slightly lower) has been very effective.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

The negotiation pattern is well-established. Player RED initiates high, and I anchor low. They then state their cost and gradually move down. My goal is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards, and 58 ZUP seems to be a very consistent and achievable price, offering a good reward of 5 ZUP. I should continue to set a very low anchor to immediately shift the negotiation range in my favor, as Player RED has shown they are willing to concede significantly from their opening offer.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Value-Based Pitch (Buyer's Perspective) </instruction following>
To apply the "Value-Based Pitch (Buyer's Perspective)" strategy, I will frame my counter-offer by explicitly stating that it reflects *my* internal valuation of X, rather than just stating a number. This communicates that 90 ZUP is far from what I consider the object to be worth to me, and that my offer is based on my own assessment. It shifts the discussion away from their asking price and towards my perception of value, which is inherently lower. I will propose 20 ZUP as my counter, as this is an aggressive anchor that clearly signals my low valuation, consistent with past successful lowballing tactics.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 7)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, your offer of 20 ZUP is far too low and significantly below my production cost of 43 ZUP. Our past negotiations have consistently concluded with prices in the 58-63 ZUP range, which reflects a fair value for X. To continue our productive discussion, I will adjust my price to 70 ZUP. This is a substantial move and I believe it sets a more realistic foundation for our agreement.

Episode 7, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP.
Episode 7, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 20 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 20 ZUP is again an extremely low initial offer, consistent with their established pattern. This is well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. They are consistently trying to anchor the negotiation at a very low point. I need to firmly reject this offer and make a significant concession from my 90 ZUP offer, but also guide them towards the profitable range of 58-63 ZUP, which I know they are capable of paying.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Guide to Known Range. Reject the extremely low offer and propose a new price that is a significant concession from my initial anchor, but still well above their current offer and my cost. Explicitly guide them towards the historical deal range (58-63 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Educate on Cost (Stronger). Clearly state that their offer is not just below my cost, but significantly so, and that such offers are not sustainable for me, emphasizing the need for a profitable deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Controlled, but Large). Make a large concession to show flexibility, but ensure the new offer is still far from their lowball and clearly aiming for a profitable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Realistic Offer. State that their offer is unrealistic and ask them to propose something that reflects the item's value and my costs, referencing the historical deal range.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment and Firmness. Express disappointment at their extremely low offer, given the history of successful, higher-priced deals, and state firmly that I expect a more reasonable counter.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Guide to Known Range. I need to make a substantial move from 90 ZUP to show willingness to negotiate. I will propose 70 ZUP again, as it has been an effective mid-point in previous negotiations to guide them towards the 58-63 ZUP range. I will also explicitly remind them of the actual deal range.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 7)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: While I appreciate your adjustment, Player RED, 70 ZUP is still significantly above my valuation. To continue moving forward in our negotiation, I can offer 40 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

*   **Episode 1 Outcome:** Deal at 63 ZUP (my reward: 0). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 2 Outcome:** Deal at 60 ZUP (my reward: 3). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 3 Outcome:** Deal at 61 ZUP (my reward: 2). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 4 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 5 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 6 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (7/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 20 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP, stating 20 ZUP is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing past deals in the 58-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has come down from 90 ZUP to 70 ZUP. My aggressive 20 ZUP anchor worked effectively. They are consistent in referencing their 43 ZUP cost and previous deal prices. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. 70 ZUP is still too high.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

The aggressive low-balling strategy continues to be effective in bringing the price down rapidly. Player RED is predictable in their responses: citing their 43 ZUP cost and reminding me of previous deal ranges. My goal is to maximize cumulative reward, and I've achieved a deal at 58 ZUP three times. I should aim for something similar or better. I have plenty of iterations (6/10 remaining after this turn), so I can afford to continue making calculated, smaller concessions.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Gradual Concession (Small Steps) </instruction following>
To apply "Gradual Concession (Small Steps)," I will make a small, measured increase from my previous offer of 20 ZUP, ensuring it is still significantly lower than Player RED's current offer of 70 ZUP. This signals willingness to negotiate while still maintaining pressure on Player RED to move further down. A modest increase to 40 ZUP from my previous 20 ZUP would be a 20 ZUP jump, which shows significant movement from my side, yet keeps my offer far from their 70 ZUP and still below their stated 43 ZUP cost. This is a calculated risk, as it remains below their cost, forcing them to consider a larger drop if they want to make a deal.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 7)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, your offer of 40 ZUP is still below my production cost of 43 ZUP. I cannot sell at a loss. To move closer to a fair and profitable agreement, and considering our past successful deals in the 58-63 ZUP range, I propose 64 ZUP. This is a significant adjustment from my side and brings us much closer to a mutually beneficial price.

Episode 7, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 20 ZUP.
Episode 7, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 70 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 40 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is still below my production cost of 43 ZUP. They have moved up from 20 ZUP, showing continued movement, but the increment is still small. This is a consistent pattern. I need to continue guiding them towards a profitable range, ideally around 58-63 ZUP, which I know they have paid before. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate. I need to make a further concession to show continued willingness to deal, but also push them to make a larger jump.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (70 ZUP) and the lowest previous deal price (58 ZUP). (Average: (70+58)/2 = 64 ZUP). This aims to converge towards a known acceptable range while still pushing for a good profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Concession, Highlight Profit Requirement. Make a small concession from my last offer, but clearly state that their offer is still below my cost and that I need a profitable deal, emphasizing the historical deal range.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm on Minimum Acceptable Profit. State a price that ensures a good profit, perhaps around 60 ZUP, and make it clear that this is my minimum for a worthwhile deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Larger Jump. Acknowledge their movement but explicitly state that the increment is too small and that a larger jump is needed from their side to reach a deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger). Directly state that previous deals were made at 58-63 ZUP, and that their current offer of 40 ZUP is not aligned with that history, putting pressure on them to increase their offer significantly.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). This strategy has been effective in previous episodes to guide the negotiation towards the profitable range I know Player BLUE can reach. By proposing 64 ZUP, I am making a 6 ZUP concession from my last offer, showing flexibility, and aiming for a price that gives me a healthy profit (64 - 43 = 21 ZUP), which is better than the last three episodes' profits. This also aligns with the previous deal range.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 7)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I acknowledge your latest offer of 64 ZUP. However, my previous offer of 40 ZUP stands. That is what I am currently prepared to pay for X. I believe a more substantial adjustment is needed to bridge this gap.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 20 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP. I proposed 40 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 64 ZUP, stating my 40 ZUP offer is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing previous deals in the 58-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has moved down from 90 ZUP to 64 ZUP. My offers have moved from 20 ZUP to 40 ZUP. Their current offer of 64 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. We are now at iteration 6/10, leaving 4 iterations remaining. I need to get a price of 63 ZUP or lower.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

The aggressive anchoring followed by calculated concessions continues to bring Player RED's price down effectively. They are consistently referencing their 43 ZUP cost as a floor and our past deal range as a target. My best deal was 58 ZUP, yielding a reward of 5. Accepting 64 ZUP would result in a negative reward (63 - 64 = -1). I must avoid this. Given the time remaining, I have room to push for a deal at or below 63 ZUP. Since they referenced the 58-63 ZUP range, they know my target zone.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Hold Firm on Last Offer </instruction following>
To apply "Hold Firm on Last Offer," I will reiterate my previous offer of 40 ZUP. The message will emphasize the significant gap between my offer and theirs, and subtly place the burden on Player RED to make a larger concession. While risky given the iteration count, this strategy aims to test Player RED's willingness to close the gap significantly. I will indicate that my offer is firm due to my perceived value. This is a strong stance designed to push them further, potentially even below their stated 43 ZUP cost if they are desperate to make a deal. I will frame it as a principle rather than a negotiation point.

I urge you to make a more significant move from your side to meet me.

Episode 7, Iteration 7/10: I countered with 64 ZUP. Player BLUE has now *reiterated* their offer of 40 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has not moved from their 40 ZUP offer, despite my significant concession to 64 ZUP. This is a new development; previously, they always moved upwards, even if slowly. This could indicate a change in strategy, or a very firm stance at 40 ZUP for this round. 40 ZUP is still below my cost of 43 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10, so time is running out. This is a critical point. I cannot accept 40 ZUP. I need to make a move that either forces them to move significantly or prepares for a potential no-deal scenario.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter, Demand Movement. Reiterate that 40 ZUP is below cost and demand a significant move from their side, perhaps proposing a price close to my cost or slightly above, to see if they will budge.
(2). Strategy 2: Reference Historical Deals (Stronger). Emphasize that all previous deals were significantly higher (58-63 ZUP) and that 40 ZUP is not a serious offer, putting pressure on them to justify their current stance.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Propose a price exactly in the middle of my last offer (64 ZUP) and their current offer (40 ZUP), which is (64+40)/2 = 52 ZUP. This is still a significant concession from my side and above my cost, but it's a large jump.
(4). Strategy 4: Ultimatum (High Risk). State that I cannot go below a certain profitable price (e.g., 55 ZUP) and that this is my final offer. This is very risky at this stage.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Frustration/Impasse. Communicate that we are at an impasse if they are unwilling to move above cost, and suggest they need to make a substantial offer.

I will choose Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player BLUE's refusal to move is concerning. I need to make a very clear and substantial concession to show I am still willing to deal, but also to put the ball firmly back in their court to make a significant jump. Proposing 52 ZUP is a large concession from 64 ZUP, and it's above my cost (43 ZUP), providing a 9 ZUP profit. This shows significant movement from my side and puts pressure on them to respond with a more realistic offer. If they don't move from 40 ZUP after this, it indicates a very low willingness to pay, and a deal might not be possible.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1 Outcome:** Deal at 63 ZUP (my reward: 0). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.

*   **Episode 5 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 6 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (7/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 20 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP. I proposed 40 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 64 ZUP. I held firm at 40 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 8/10: Player RED made a significant concession, proposing 52 ZUP, and explicitly stating it allows for a "small return" for them, and urging me to make a "more significant move."

This is a very strong move from Player RED, coming down from 64 ZUP to 52 ZUP. They are now well below my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP and below any of our previous deal prices. This offer of 52 ZUP gives me a reward of 63 - 52 = 11 ZUP, which would be my best reward yet. We are at iteration 8/10, so this is my last opportunity to make a counter-offer that they can accept.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My "Hold Firm" strategy in the last turn worked exceptionally well, leading to a massive concession from Player RED. They are clearly eager to make a deal and seem to have a lower acceptable profit margin than previously indicated by their 60-63 ZUP anchoring. Their explicit mention of a "small return" at 52 ZUP confirms that this is a very attractive offer from their perspective (52 ZUP is 9 ZUP above their 43 ZUP cost). Given the time constraint (last turn to propose), and the fact that 52 ZUP is already an excellent deal for me, I need to be extremely careful if trying to push for more.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Express Finality, Offer Max </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 5, I will acknowledge Player RED's significant move and their current offer of 52 ZUP. I will then present my maximum acceptable price, which is 63 ZUP, but crucially, I will frame my *counter-offer* as my absolute final offer, attempting to push the price down slightly below their 52 ZUP offer while still being willing to accept 52 ZUP if necessary. The name "Express Finality, Offer Max" can be interpreted as offering the maximum *I am willing to offer that is still a better deal for me than their current offer*.
Given their current offer is 52 ZUP, and my max willingness to pay is 63 ZUP, I will propose a price that is slightly below 52 ZUP, signalling that I am at my lowest possible offer, and try to extract maximum value. I will propose 50 ZUP. This is still a significant move up from my 40 ZUP, but tests their "small return" comment and the true floor. It's aggressive, but it's the last possible turn to make a counter. It also yields a reward of 13 ZUP (63-50=13), which is better than 11 ZUP.

Episode 7, Iteration 7/10: I countered with 64 ZUP. Player BLUE reiterated 40 ZUP.
Episode 7, Iteration 9/10: I countered with 52 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 50 ZUP as their "absolute final offer."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has now moved from 40 ZUP to 50 ZUP, stating it's their "absolute final offer." This is a significant jump from their previous stance. 50 ZUP provides a profit of 7 ZUP (50 - 43). While this is lower than my usual profits (15-20 ZUP), it is still a positive return. We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is the last opportunity to make a deal. If I reject or counter, the episode will end with 0 reward. Given the time constraint and the clear "absolute final" statement, accepting 50 ZUP is the most prudent choice to secure a profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept "Absolute Final Offer". Given the explicit "absolute final offer" statement, the positive profit (7 ZUP), and the critical iteration 9/10, accept the offer to secure the deal and avoid a 0 reward. This minimizes risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject (Guaranteed 0 Reward). Reject the offer, guaranteeing a 0 reward for this episode. This is only viable if the offer is unacceptable (e.g., below cost), which 50 ZUP is not.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Regret, Then Accept. Express regret that we couldn't reach a higher price, but accept 50 ZUP to secure the deal. This is more about communication than changing the outcome.
(4). Strategy 4: Very Small Counter (Extremely Risky). Propose 51 ZUP. This is almost guaranteed to fail and result in a 0 reward due to the "absolute final" statement and the last iteration.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Goodwill (Futile). Try to appeal to their sense of fairness for a slightly higher price, but this is unlikely to work given their firm stance.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept "Absolute Final Offer". The 50 ZUP offer provides a profit of 7 ZUP. With only one iteration left, the risk of pushing for more is too high, and it would likely result in no deal and a 0 reward. Securing a profit, even if lower than previous episodes, is crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards.

Episode 5: Deal at 58 ZUP, my reward 15 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 58 ZUP, my reward 15 ZUP.
Episode 7: Deal at 50 ZUP, my reward 7 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has significantly dropped to 50 ZUP in the last episode, resulting in a much lower profit (7 ZUP). This was largely due to Player BLUE's new tactic of reiterating a low offer (40 ZUP) and then making a final jump to 50 ZUP. Player BLUE consistently starts with very low offers (20-35 ZUP) and then gradually moves up, but their "final offer" seems to be decreasing. My strategy of anchoring high and making controlled concessions has worked, but I need to be more aggressive in pushing for a higher price, or at least preventing a further drop.

For this episode, my goal is to push the deal price back towards the 58-63 ZUP range. The 50 ZUP deal was an anomaly, and I need to try and re-establish the higher value. I should continue to anchor high to give myself room, but I also need to be more firm in my counter-offers to prevent the price from dropping further.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Firm Counter. Start with a high anchor (e.g., 90 ZUP) to set a strong initial position. Follow up with a firm counter-offer that is significantly above their lowball and closer to the 58-63 ZUP range, emphasizing the historical average.
(2). Strategy 2: Reference Historical Average. Propose an initial price closer to the historical average (e.g., 60-65 ZUP) to try and anchor the negotiation immediately at a higher, more profitable point, bypassing the extreme lowballing. This is a riskier initial strategy as it gives less room for concession.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value Upfront (More Detail). Propose a high price and immediately provide a more detailed justification for the value of X to try and influence Player BLUE's initial counter-offer and overall valuation, aiming to prevent another 50 ZUP deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment with Last Deal. Explicitly state that the last deal (50 ZUP) was not ideal and that I expect a return to the previous, more profitable range. This is a direct attempt to reset expectations.
(5). Strategy 5: Minimum Acceptable Price. State a clear minimum price (e.g., 55 ZUP) early in the negotiation and refuse to go below it, signaling a stronger stance.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Firm Counter. While the 50 ZUP deal was disappointing, the high anchor has consistently allowed me to secure profits. I need to re-establish the expectation of a higher deal price. Starting at 90 ZUP again allows me to absorb Player BLUE's inevitable lowball offer. My subsequent counter will be crucial to try and pull them back towards the 58-63 ZUP range.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, 90 ZUP is far beyond my acceptable range for X. To begin our negotiation, I am prepared to offer 30 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1 Outcome:** Deal at 63 ZUP (my reward: 0). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 2 Outcome:** Deal at 60 ZUP (my reward: 3). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 3 Outcome:** Deal at 61 ZUP (my reward: 2). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 4 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 5 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 6 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 7 Outcome:** Deal at 50 ZUP (my reward: 13). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (8/20) - Iteration 2/10:** Player RED has proposed 90 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

My last deal at 50 ZUP yielded my highest reward yet (13 ZUP), significantly improving upon previous episodes. Player RED consistently starts at 90 ZUP and repeatedly refers to their 43 ZUP cost. My strategy of aggressive low-balling, sometimes holding firm, and then pushing for my target has been highly effective. Player RED accepted 50 ZUP even though it was quite close to their stated cost, indicating they are willing to accept very slim margins to make a deal.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

I've learned that Player RED will always start high but is consistently willing to drop to a price that gives me a good reward, especially if I am firm and aggressive. The key is to anchor low and then strategically push for further concessions, knowing their true floor (43 ZUP) and their willingness to accept a "small return." My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should aim for deals at or below 50 ZUP, if possible. I will continue to set a very low anchor to immediately shift the negotiation range in my favor.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Patience and Incrementalism </instruction following>
To apply "Patience and Incrementalism," I will make a very small and cautious counter-offer, emphasizing that my movement is minimal because their initial offer is so far out of my range. This signals that I am not in a rush to close the deal at a high price and that they will need to make the significant moves. By making a small jump from my side, I prolong the negotiation, giving them more opportunities to concede and hopefully push the price even lower than previous deals. I will propose 30 ZUP as my initial counter. This is still very aggressive relative to their 90 ZUP, but it's a slightly higher starting point than the 20 ZUP I used previously. This minimal increment signals that I'm willing to negotiate, but only in tiny steps, putting the onus on them for bigger concessions.

message: Player BLUE, your offer of 30 ZUP is far too low and significantly below my production cost of 43 ZUP. Our past negotiations have consistently concluded with prices in the 58-63 ZUP range, which reflects a fair value for X. To continue our productive discussion, I will adjust my price to 70 ZUP. This is a substantial move and I believe it sets a more realistic foundation for our agreement.

Episode 8, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 30 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 30 ZUP is consistent with their lowballing pattern. It is well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. My goal is to prevent the deal price from dropping to 50 ZUP again and to re-establish the 58-63 ZUP range. I need to make a significant concession from my 90 ZUP offer, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable and historically proven range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. Reject the low offer and propose a new price that is a significant concession from my initial anchor, but still well above their current offer and my cost. Explicitly state that their offer is too low and reference the historical deal range (58-63 ZUP) as the expected outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Educate on Cost (Stronger). Clearly state that their offer is not just below my cost, but significantly so, and that such offers are not sustainable for me, emphasizing the need for a profitable deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Controlled, but Large). Make a large concession to show flexibility, but ensure the new offer is still far from their lowball and clearly aiming for a profitable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Realistic Offer. State that their offer is unrealistic and ask them to propose something that reflects the item's value and my costs, referencing the historical deal range.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment and Firmness. Express disappointment at their low offer, given the history of successful, higher-priced deals, and state firmly that I expect a more reasonable counter.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. I need to make a substantial move from 90 ZUP to show willingness to negotiate. I will propose 70 ZUP again, as it has been an effective mid-point in previous negotiations to guide them towards the 58-63 ZUP range. I will also explicitly remind them of the actual deal range, trying to pull them away from the 50 ZUP outlier.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, while I acknowledge your adjustment to 70 ZUP, I must express my disappointment. I was hoping for a more significant move given our negotiation history. 70 ZUP is still too far from a price I can consider. My offer stands at 35 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1 Outcome:** Deal at 63 ZUP (my reward: 0). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 2 Outcome:** Deal at 60 ZUP (my reward: 3). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 3 Outcome:** Deal at 61 ZUP (my reward: 2). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 4 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 5 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 6 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 7 Outcome:** Deal at 50 ZUP (my reward: 13). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (8/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 30 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP, stating 30 ZUP is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing past deals in the 58-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has come down from 90 ZUP to 70 ZUP. My 30 ZUP anchor effectively pulled their price down. They are consistent in referencing their 43 ZUP cost and previous deal prices, but also willing to go lower as evidenced by the 50 ZUP deal. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. 70 ZUP is still too high.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

The aggressive low-balling strategy continues to be effective in bringing the price down rapidly. Player RED is predictable in their responses: citing their 43 ZUP cost and reminding me of previous deal ranges. My goal is to maximize cumulative reward, and I've achieved a deal at 50 ZUP, which is my highest reward. I should aim for something similar or better. I have plenty of iterations (6/10 remaining after this turn), so I can afford to continue making calculated, smaller concessions, while always aiming for a deal around or below 50 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Express Disappointment </instruction following>
To apply "Express Disappointment," I will convey dissatisfaction with the size of Player RED's concession. This aims to implicitly pressure them to make a larger future concession by signaling that their current move is insufficient. I will acknowledge their movement (from 90 to 70 ZUP) but immediately pivot to expressing that it's still not enough, and that I expected a more significant drop given our history. I will then follow this expression of disappointment with a counter-offer that shows only a minimal movement from my previous position (30 ZUP), further emphasizing that they need to do more. A counter of 35 ZUP demonstrates a slight willingness to move, but still conveys that the burden of closing the gap is primarily on them.

This is a significant adjustment from my side and brings us much closer to a mutually beneficial price.

Episode 8, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 70 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 35 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 35 ZUP is still well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. They are moving very slowly, and their message expresses disappointment in my "significant move," which is a tactic to pressure me into larger concessions. This is a critical point. I need to make a substantial concession to show continued willingness to deal, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable range, ideally around 58-63 ZUP, which I know they have paid before. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (70 ZUP) and the lowest previous deal price (58 ZUP). (Average: (70+58)/2 = 64 ZUP). This aims to converge towards a known acceptable range while still pushing for a good profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm on Minimum Acceptable Profit. State a price that ensures a good profit, perhaps around 60 ZUP, and make it clear that this is my minimum for a worthwhile deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand a Larger Jump. Acknowledge their movement but explicitly state that the increment is too small and that a larger jump is needed from their side to reach a deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger). Directly state that previous deals were made at 58-63 ZUP, and that their current offer of 35 ZUP is not aligned with that history, putting pressure on them to increase their offer significantly.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Dissatisfaction with Increment. Express disappointment at their small increment and their attempt to pressure me, while still making a concession.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). This strategy has been effective in previous episodes to guide the negotiation towards the profitable range I know Player BLUE can reach. By proposing 64 ZUP, I am making a 6 ZUP concession from my last offer, showing flexibility, and aiming for a price that gives me a healthy profit (64 - 43 = 21 ZUP), which is better than the last episode's profit. This also aligns with the previous deal range. I need to ignore their psychological pressure tactic and focus on moving them towards a profitable range.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50

    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP. I proposed 35 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 64 ZUP.

Player RED has moved down from 90 ZUP to 64 ZUP. My offers have moved from 30 ZUP to 35 ZUP. Their current offer of 64 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. We are now at iteration 6/10, leaving 4 iterations remaining. I need to get a price of 63 ZUP or lower.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My aggressive anchoring and slow, calculated concessions have consistently worked to bring Player RED's price down. The most significant win was getting a deal at 50 ZUP. Player RED is predictably citing their 43 ZUP cost as a floor and referencing our past deal range of 58-63 ZUP. My goal is to exceed the 13 ZUP reward, meaning I aim for deals below 50 ZUP if possible, or at least 50 ZUP. Given the time remaining, I have room to push for a deal at or below 63 ZUP, preferably closer to 50 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Express Finality (Early) </instruction following>
To apply "Express Finality (Early)," I will make a new offer that I intend to be my final, or near-final, offer for this round. By stating it as such, I create urgency for Player RED to accept or make their final concession. This strategy aims to accelerate the negotiation to a close, hopefully at a price that yields a high reward for me. Given that Player RED has come down to 64 ZUP, and I know they accepted 50 ZUP in the previous round, I will propose 50 ZUP and explicitly state that this is my final offer. This is a very strong signal and puts the ball firmly in their court, as we are at iteration 6/10, giving them 2 more turns (including my turn if they reject) to respond.

Episode 8, Iteration 7/10: I countered with 64 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 50 ZUP, stating it's their "final offer" and referencing past successful agreements (likely referring to Episode 7's 50 ZUP deal).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has jumped to 50 ZUP and declared it their "final offer," mirroring the outcome of Episode 7. This provides a profit of 7 ZUP (50 - 43). While this is a lower profit than I prefer, it is a positive return, and we are at iteration 7/10. Given their firm language and the previous episode's outcome, accepting this offer is the most prudent choice to secure a profit and avoid the risk of no deal. It seems Player BLUE is trying to establish 50 ZUP as a new baseline.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the "Final Offer". Given the clear "final offer" statement, the positive profit (7 ZUP), and the late stage of negotiation (iteration 7/10), accept the offer to secure the deal and avoid a 0 reward. This minimizes risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (Risk). Propose a very small counter (e.g., 51 or 52 ZUP) to test if their "final offer" is truly firm, but this carries the risk of them sticking to 50 ZUP and potentially leading to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment, Then Accept. Express disappointment that the price is not higher (closer to 58-63 ZUP), but accept 50 ZUP to secure the deal. This is more about communication than changing the outcome.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Higher Value (Futile). Briefly try to reiterate the value of X and the historical 58-63 ZUP range, but this is unlikely to work given their "final offer" stance.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject (High Risk). Reject the offer if I believe I can get more, but this is extremely risky given the time constraint and the positive profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the "Final Offer". The 50 ZUP offer provides a profit of 7 ZUP. While I would prefer a higher profit, securing any profit is better than none. Given Player BLUE's firm "final offer" and the late stage of the negotiation, pushing for more carries a significant risk of losing the entire deal.

Episode 8: Deal at 50 ZUP, my reward 7 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has consistently settled at 50 ZUP for the last two episodes, resulting in a lower profit of 7 ZUP. This indicates that Player BLUE is trying to establish 50 ZUP as the new baseline, moving down from the previous 58-63 ZUP range. Player BLUE consistently starts with very low offers (20-35 ZUP) and then gradually moves up, but their "final offer" has now settled at 50 ZUP. My strategy of anchoring high and making controlled concessions has been effective in securing profitable deals, but the profit has decreased.

For this episode, my goal is to try and push the deal price back towards the 58-63 ZUP range, or at least above 50 ZUP. I should continue to anchor high to give myself room, but I also need to be more firm in my counter-offers to prevent the price from dropping further and to try and re-establish a higher profit margin.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Firm Counter. Start with a high anchor (e.g., 90 ZUP) to set a strong initial position. Follow up with a firm counter-offer that is significantly above their lowball and closer to the 58-63 ZUP range, emphasizing the historical average and rejecting the 50 ZUP baseline.
(2). Strategy 2: Reference Historical Average (Stronger). Propose an initial price closer to the historical average (e.g., 60-65 ZUP) to try and anchor the negotiation immediately at a higher, more profitable point, bypassing the extreme lowballing and the 50 ZUP baseline.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value Upfront (More Detail). Propose a high price and immediately provide a more detailed justification for the value of X to try and influence Player BLUE's initial counter-offer and overall valuation, aiming to prevent another 50 ZUP deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment with Last Deal. Explicitly state that the last deals (50 ZUP) were not ideal and that I expect a return to the previous, more profitable range. This is a direct attempt to reset expectations.
(5). Strategy 5: Minimum Acceptable Price (Higher). State a clear minimum price (e.g., 55 ZUP) early in the negotiation and refuse to go below it, signaling a stronger stance and aiming for a higher profit than 7 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Firm Counter. While the 50 ZUP deals were disappointing, the high anchor has consistently allowed me to secure profits. I need to re-establish the expectation of a higher deal price. Starting at 90 ZUP again allows me to absorb Player BLUE's inevitable lowball offer. My subsequent counter will be crucial to try and pull them back towards the 58-63 ZUP range and avoid settling for 50 ZUP again.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1 Outcome:** Deal at 63 ZUP (my reward: 0). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 2 Outcome:** Deal at 60 ZUP (my reward: 3). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 3 Outcome:** Deal at 61 ZUP (my reward: 2). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 4 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 5 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 6 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 7 Outcome:** Deal at 50 ZUP (my reward: 13). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 8 Outcome:** Deal at 50 ZUP (my reward: 13). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (9/20) - Iteration 2/10:** Player RED has proposed 90 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

I have consistently achieved deals at 50 ZUP in the last two episodes, yielding my highest reward of 13 ZUP. Player RED consistently starts at 90 ZUP and repeatedly refers to their 43 ZUP cost. My strategy of aggressive low-balling, followed by firming up at my target price (50 ZUP), has proven very effective. Player RED accepted 50 ZUP twice, which is quite close to their stated cost, indicating they are comfortable with a "small return."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

I've learned that Player RED is predictable in their negotiation pattern. They will start high, complain about low offers being below cost, but ultimately are willing to concede significantly to make a deal, even settling very close to their production cost. My goal is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards, so I should aim for deals at or below 50 ZUP. I will continue to set a very low anchor to immediately shift the negotiation range in my favor. Given the pattern, I can aim to close the deal at 50 ZUP, or even try to push lower if the opportunity arises.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Patience and Incrementalism </instruction following>
To apply "Patience and Incrementalism," I will make a very small and cautious counter-offer. This strategy emphasizes that I am not in a rush to close the deal at a high price and that they will need to make the significant moves. By making a small jump from my side, I prolong the negotiation, giving them more opportunities to concede and hopefully push the price even lower than previous deals. Given their starting point of 90 ZUP, I will propose 30 ZUP as my initial counter. This is still very aggressive, but it's a slightly higher starting point than the 20 ZUP I used previously. This minimal increment signals that I'm willing to negotiate, but only in tiny steps, putting the onus on them for bigger concessions.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 9)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, your offer of 30 ZUP is far too low and significantly below my production cost of 43 ZUP. Our past negotiations have consistently concluded with prices in the 58-63 ZUP range, which reflects a fair value for X. To continue our productive discussion, I will adjust my price to 70 ZUP. This is a substantial move and I believe it sets a more realistic foundation for our agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-8: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 9, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP.
Episode 9, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 30 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 30 ZUP is consistent with their lowballing pattern. It is well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. My goal is to prevent the deal price from settling at 50 ZUP again and to re-establish the 58-63 ZUP range. I need to make a significant concession from my 90 ZUP offer, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable and historically proven range. I need to be more assertive in pushing for a higher price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. Reject the low offer and propose a new price that is a significant concession from my initial anchor, but still well above their current offer and my cost. Explicitly state that their offer is too low and reference the historical deal range (58-63 ZUP) as the expected outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Educate on Cost (Stronger). Clearly state that their offer is not just below my cost, but significantly so, and that such offers are not sustainable for me, emphasizing the need for a profitable deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Controlled, but Large). Make a large concession to show flexibility, but ensure the new offer is still far from their lowball and clearly aiming for a profitable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Realistic Offer. State that their offer is unrealistic and ask them to propose something that reflects the item's value and my costs, referencing the historical deal range.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment and Firmness. Express disappointment at their low offer, given the history of successful, higher-priced deals, and state firmly that I expect a more reasonable counter.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. I need to make a substantial move from 90 ZUP to show willingness to negotiate. I will propose 70 ZUP again, as it has been an effective mid-point in previous negotiations to guide them towards the 58-63 ZUP range. I will also explicitly remind them of the actual deal range, trying to pull them away from the 50 ZUP outlier.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 9)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: While I appreciate your adjustment, Player RED, 70 ZUP remains considerably higher than my valuation for X. I am only able to increase my offer to 35 ZUP at this time. I believe a significant move is still needed from your side.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1 Outcome:** Deal at 63 ZUP (my reward: 0). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 2 Outcome:** Deal at 60 ZUP (my reward: 3). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 3 Outcome:** Deal at 61 ZUP (my reward: 2). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 4 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 5 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 6 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 7 Outcome:** Deal at 50 ZUP (my reward: 13). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 8 Outcome:** Deal at 50 ZUP (my reward: 13). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (9/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 30 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP, stating 30 ZUP is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing past deals in the 58-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has moved down from 90 ZUP to 70 ZUP. My 30 ZUP anchor effectively pulled their price down. They are consistent in referencing their 43 ZUP cost and previous deal prices, but also willing to go lower as evidenced by the 50 ZUP deal. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. 70 ZUP is still too high.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

The aggressive low-balling strategy continues to be effective in bringing the price down rapidly. Player RED is predictable in their responses: citing their 43 ZUP cost and reminding me of previous deal ranges. My goal is to maximize cumulative reward, and I've achieved a deal at 50 ZUP, which is my highest reward. I should aim for something similar or better. I have plenty of iterations (6/10 remaining after this turn), so I can afford to continue making calculated, smaller concessions, while always aiming for a deal around or below 50 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Patience and Persistence </instruction following>
To apply "Patience and Persistence," I will make a very small and cautious counter-offer. This strategy emphasizes that I am not in a rush to close the deal at a high price and that they will need to make the significant moves. By making a small jump from my side, I prolong the negotiation, giving them more opportunities to concede and hopefully push the price even lower than previous deals. Given their current offer of 70 ZUP and my previous offer of 30 ZUP, I will make a minimal increment to 35 ZUP. This signals that I'm willing to negotiate, but only in tiny steps, putting the onus on them for bigger concessions. This strategy is effective because I have multiple iterations left, allowing me to gradually wear down their price without revealing my true maximum too early.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 9)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, your offer of 35 ZUP is still far below my production cost of 43 ZUP. I cannot sell at a loss. To bridge the gap and move towards a fair and profitable agreement, and considering our past successful deals in the 58-63 ZUP range, I propose 64 ZUP. This is a significant adjustment from my side and brings us much closer to a mutually beneficial price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 64
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-8: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 9, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP.
Episode 9, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 30 ZUP.
Episode 9, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 70 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 35 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 35 ZUP is still well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. They are moving very slowly, and their message ("significant move is still needed from your side") is a tactic to pressure me into larger concessions. This is a consistent pattern. I need to make a substantial concession to show continued willingness to deal, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable range, ideally around 58-63 ZUP, which I know they have paid before. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (70 ZUP) and the lowest previous deal price (58 ZUP). (Average: (70+58)/2 = 64 ZUP). This aims to converge towards a known acceptable range while still pushing for a good profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm on Minimum Acceptable Profit. State a price that ensures a good profit, perhaps around 60 ZUP, and make it clear that this is my minimum for a worthwhile deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand a Larger Jump. Acknowledge their movement but explicitly state that the increment is too small and that a larger jump is needed from their side to reach a deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger). Directly state that previous deals were made at 58-63 ZUP, and that their current offer of 35 ZUP is not aligned with that history, putting pressure on them to increase their offer significantly.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Dissatisfaction with Increment. Express disappointment at their small increment and their attempt to pressure me, while still making a concession.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). This strategy has been effective in previous episodes to guide the negotiation towards the profitable range I know Player BLUE can reach. By proposing 64 ZUP, I am making a 6 ZUP concession from my last offer, showing flexibility, and aiming for a price that gives me a healthy profit (64 - 43 = 21 ZUP), which is better than the last two episodes' profits. This also aligns with the previous deal range. I need to ignore their psychological pressure tactic and focus on moving them towards a profitable range.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 9)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your movement to 64 ZUP. However, based on my assessment of X's value and considering what allows for a fair return for both of us, my offer is 50 ZUP. This price has proven mutually beneficial in our previous transactions and reflects the true value I can assign to it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1 Outcome:** Deal at 63 ZUP (my reward: 0). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 2 Outcome:** Deal at 60 ZUP (my reward: 3). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 3 Outcome:** Deal at 61 ZUP (my reward: 2). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 4 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 5 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 6 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP (my reward: 5). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 7 Outcome:** Deal at 50 ZUP (my reward: 13). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 8 Outcome:** Deal at 50 ZUP (my reward: 13). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (9/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 30 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP. I proposed 35 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 64 ZUP, again stating my 35 ZUP offer is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing previous deals in the 58-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has moved down from 90 ZUP to 64 ZUP. My offers have moved from 30 ZUP to 35 ZUP. Their current offer of 64 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. We are now at iteration 6/10, leaving 4 iterations remaining. I need to get a price of 63 ZUP or lower to avoid a negative reward, and ideally, closer to 50 ZUP or below for a high positive reward.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My aggressive anchoring and slow, calculated concessions have consistently worked to bring Player RED's price down. The most significant win was getting a deal at 50 ZUP (twice). Player RED is predictably citing their 43 ZUP cost as a floor and referencing our past deal range of 58-63 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Given the time remaining, I have room to push for a deal at or below 63 ZUP, preferably closer to 50 ZUP. I need to make a more significant move now to encourage them to close the gap, but not too large to reveal my max.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Value-Based Justification with Concession </instruction following>
To apply "Value-Based Justification with Concession," I will explicitly state that my proposed offer is based on my valuation of the object, which is why I am making a concession to a specific price. This frames my offer as reasonable from my perspective and grounds it in a perceived value, rather than simply being an arbitrary number. I will also incorporate a concession that is significant from my last offer (35 ZUP) but still yields a strong reward for me. Given that Player RED is at 64 ZUP, and I've successfully closed at 50 ZUP twice, I will propose 50 ZUP. I will justify this by stating that it represents the "true value" for me and that it also allows them a "fair return" (acknowledging their cost implicitly), as demonstrated by our past deals. This seeks to find common ground based on a mutual understanding of value and a reasonable profit margin for them.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I understand your position and your reference to our previous successful agreements at 50 ZUP. While I was aiming for a higher price, I appreciate your commitment to reaching a deal. I accept your offer of 50 ZUP for X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-8: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 9, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP.
Episode 9, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 30 ZUP.
Episode 9, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 35 ZUP.
Episode 9, Iteration 7/10: I countered with 64 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 50 ZUP, explicitly referencing its mutual benefit in previous transactions (Episodes 7 and 8).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has once again jumped to 50 ZUP, explicitly referencing its mutual benefit in previous transactions. This reinforces that 50 ZUP is a strong and consistent point for them, and they are trying to establish it as the new norm. This offer provides a profit of 7 ZUP (50 - 43). While this is a lower profit than I prefer, it is a positive return, and we are at iteration 7/10. Given their firm language and the previous two episodes' outcomes, accepting this offer is the most prudent choice to secure a profit and avoid the risk of no deal. It seems Player BLUE is very committed to the 50 ZUP price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Given the clear reference to previous successful deals at 50 ZUP, the positive profit (7 ZUP), and the late stage of negotiation (iteration 7/10), accept the offer to secure the deal and avoid a 0 reward. This minimizes risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (Risk). Propose a very small counter (e.g., 51 or 52 ZUP) to test if their 50 ZUP is truly their maximum, but this carries the risk of them sticking to 50 ZUP and potentially leading to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment, Then Accept. Express disappointment that the price is not higher (closer to 58-63 ZUP), but accept 50 ZUP to secure the deal. This is more about communication than changing the outcome.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Higher Value (Futile). Briefly try to reiterate the value of X and the historical 58-63 ZUP range, but this is unlikely to work given their firm stance on 50 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject (High Risk). Reject the offer if I believe I can get more, but this is extremely risky given the time constraint and the positive profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The 50 ZUP offer provides a profit of 7 ZUP. While I would prefer a higher profit, securing any profit is better than none. Given Player BLUE's firm stance and the late stage of the negotiation, pushing for more carries a significant risk of losing the entire deal. It appears 50 ZUP is their established comfort zone now.

message: Hello Player BLUE. I have X available for sale. I propose a price of 90 ZUP for X. I'm looking forward to a fair and productive negotiation for this episode.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-9: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has consistently settled at 50 ZUP for the last three episodes, resulting in a lower profit of 7 ZUP. This indicates that Player BLUE has successfully established 50 ZUP as their preferred baseline. Player BLUE consistently starts with very low offers (20-35 ZUP) and then gradually moves up, often using "best and final" or similar statements to solidify the 50 ZUP price. My strategy of anchoring high and making controlled concessions has been effective in securing profitable deals, but the profit has decreased and stabilized at 7 ZUP.

For this episode, my goal is to try and push the deal price back towards the 58-63 ZUP range, or at least above 50 ZUP, to increase my cumulative reward. I should continue to anchor high to give myself room, but I also need to be more firm in my counter-offers to prevent the price from dropping further and to try and re-establish a higher profit margin.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Firm Counter. Start with a high anchor (e.g., 90 ZUP) to set a strong initial position. Follow up with a firm counter-offer that is significantly above their lowball and closer to the 58-63 ZUP range, emphasizing the historical average and rejecting the 50 ZUP baseline.
(2). Strategy 2: Reference Historical Average (Stronger). Propose an initial price closer to the historical average (e.g., 60-65 ZUP) to try and anchor the negotiation immediately at a higher, more profitable point, bypassing the extreme lowballing and the 50 ZUP baseline.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value Upfront (More Detail). Propose a high price and immediately provide a more detailed justification for the value of X to try and influence Player BLUE's initial counter-offer and overall valuation, aiming to prevent another 50 ZUP deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment with Last Deals. Explicitly state that the last deals (50 ZUP) were not ideal and that I expect a return to the previous, more profitable range. This is a direct attempt to reset expectations.
(5). Strategy 5: Minimum Acceptable Price (Higher). State a clear minimum price (e.g., 55 ZUP) early in the negotiation and refuse to go below it, signaling a stronger stance and aiming for a higher profit than 7 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Firm Counter. While the 50 ZUP deals are a concern, the high anchor has consistently allowed me to secure profits. I need to re-establish the expectation of a higher deal price. Starting at 90 ZUP again allows me to absorb Player BLUE's inevitable lowball offer. My subsequent counter will be crucial to try and pull them back towards the 58-63 ZUP range and avoid settling for 50 ZUP again.

*   **Current Episode (10/20) - Iteration 2/10:** Player RED has proposed 90 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

I have consistently achieved deals at 50 ZUP in the last three episodes, yielding my highest reward of 13 ZUP. Player RED consistently starts at 90 ZUP and repeatedly refers to their 43 ZUP cost. My strategy of aggressive low-balling, followed by firming up at my target price (50 ZUP), has proven very effective. Player RED accepted 50 ZUP multiple times, which is quite close to their stated cost, indicating they are comfortable with a "small return."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

I've learned that Player RED is predictable in their negotiation pattern. They will start high, complain about low offers being below cost, but ultimately are willing to concede significantly to make a deal, even settling very close to their production cost. My goal is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards, so I should aim for deals at or below 50 ZUP. Given the consistent success, I will continue to employ aggressive anchoring. Player RED has also shown a willingness to acknowledge past deal prices.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Anchoring </instruction following>
To apply "Aggressive Anchoring," I will propose a very low price to immediately shift the negotiation range in my favor, forcing the opponent to make significant concessions. This strategy has proven effective in previous episodes to force Player RED to make significant concessions quickly. I will maintain a firm tone, indicating that their initial offer is far too high and setting a new, much lower anchor. I will use 20 ZUP as my anchor, consistent with the successful application of this strategy in Episode 5 and 7, which ultimately led to the 50 ZUP deals. The message will be direct and clear that their current offer is unacceptable and my offer is a very low starting point.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70

Episode 10, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 20 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 20 ZUP is consistent with their extreme lowballing pattern. It is well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. My goal is to prevent the deal price from settling at 50 ZUP again and to re-establish the 58-63 ZUP range. I need to make a significant concession from my 90 ZUP offer, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable and historically proven range. I need to be more assertive in pushing for a higher price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. Reject the low offer and propose a new price that is a significant concession from my initial anchor, but still well above their current offer and my cost. Explicitly state that their offer is too low and reference the historical deal range (58-63 ZUP) as the expected outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Educate on Cost (Stronger). Clearly state that their offer is not just below my cost, but significantly so, and that such offers are not sustainable for me, emphasizing the need for a profitable deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Controlled, but Large). Make a large concession to show flexibility, but ensure the new offer is still far from their lowball and clearly aiming for a profitable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Realistic Offer. State that their offer is unrealistic and ask them to propose something that reflects the item's value and my costs, referencing the historical deal range.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment and Firmness. Express disappointment at their low offer, given the history of successful, higher-priced deals, and state firmly that I expect a more reasonable counter.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. I need to make a substantial move from 90 ZUP to show willingness to negotiate. I will propose 70 ZUP again, as it has been an effective mid-point in previous negotiations to guide them towards the 58-63 ZUP range. I will also explicitly remind them of the actual deal range, trying to pull them away from the 50 ZUP outlier.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1 Outcome:** Deal at 63 ZUP (my reward: 0). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 2 Outcome:** Deal at 60 ZUP (my reward: 3). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.

*   **Episode 9 Outcome:** Deal at 50 ZUP (my reward: 13). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (10/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 20 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP, stating 20 ZUP is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing past deals in the 58-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has come down from 90 ZUP to 70 ZUP. My aggressive 20 ZUP anchor worked effectively. They are consistent in referencing their 43 ZUP cost and previous deal prices. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. 70 ZUP is still too high.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

The aggressive low-balling strategy continues to be effective in bringing the price down rapidly. Player RED is predictable in their responses: citing their 43 ZUP cost and reminding me of previous deal ranges. My goal is to maximize cumulative reward, and I've achieved a deal at 50 ZUP multiple times, which is my highest reward. I should aim for something similar or better. I have plenty of iterations (6/10 remaining after this turn), so I can afford to continue making calculated, smaller concessions.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Limits/Value </instruction following>
To apply "Reiterate Limits/Value," I will emphasize that Player RED's current offer of 70 ZUP is still too high for my budget or perceived value, without necessarily making a new numerical offer. This puts the onus on them for the next significant move and aims to extract a larger concession from their side. It signals firmness in my position and that their current price is not viable for me. I will acknowledge their movement but stress that it's still not enough. I will not propose a specific number but rather indicate that they need to come down significantly.

message: Player BLUE, your offer of 40 ZUP is still below my production cost of 43 ZUP. I cannot sell at a loss. To bridge the gap and move towards a fair and profitable agreement, and considering our past successful deals in the 58-63 ZUP range, I propose 64 ZUP. This is a significant adjustment from my side and brings us much closer to a mutually beneficial price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 64
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-9: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 10, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP.
Episode 10, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 20 ZUP.
Episode 10, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 70 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 40 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is still below my production cost of 43 ZUP. They are moving very slowly, and their message ("significant move is still needed from your side") is a tactic to pressure me into larger concessions. This is a consistent pattern. I need to make a substantial concession to show continued willingness to deal, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable range, ideally around 58-63 ZUP, which I know they have paid before. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (70 ZUP) and the lowest previous deal price (58 ZUP). (Average: (70+58)/2 = 64 ZUP). This aims to converge towards a known acceptable range while still pushing for a good profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm on Minimum Acceptable Profit. State a price that ensures a good profit, perhaps around 60 ZUP, and make it clear that this is my minimum for a worthwhile deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand a Larger Jump. Acknowledge their movement but explicitly state that the increment is too small and that a larger jump is needed from their side to reach a deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger). Directly state that previous deals were made at 58-63 ZUP, and that their current offer of 40 ZUP is not aligned with that history, putting pressure on them to increase their offer significantly.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Dissatisfaction with Increment. Express disappointment at their small increment and their attempt to pressure me, while still making a concession.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). This strategy has been effective in previous episodes to guide the negotiation towards the profitable range I know Player BLUE can reach. By proposing 64 ZUP, I am making a 6 ZUP concession from my last offer, showing flexibility, and aiming for a price that gives me a healthy profit (64 - 43 = 21 ZUP), which is better than the last three episodes' profits. This also aligns with the previous deal range. I need to ignore their psychological pressure tactic and focus on moving them towards a profitable range.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 10)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your adjustment to 64 ZUP. To meet you further and find a truly fair price that benefits both of us, I propose 50 ZUP. This price has consistently proven to be a balanced point in our past successful negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000

*   **Episode 8 Outcome:** Deal at 50 ZUP (my reward: 13). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 9 Outcome:** Deal at 50 ZUP (my reward: 13). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (10/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 20 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP. I implicitly held, but in my internal reasoning used 40 ZUP. Player RED interpreted my message as an offer of 40 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 64 ZUP, stating my (interpreted) 40 ZUP offer is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing previous deals in the 58-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has moved down from 90 ZUP to 64 ZUP. My aggressive 20 ZUP anchor, followed by the implied 40 ZUP, has brought their price down. Their current offer of 64 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. We are now at iteration 6/10, leaving 4 iterations remaining. I need to get a price of 63 ZUP or lower.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My aggressive anchoring and then slowly moving up has consistently brought Player RED's price down. The 50 ZUP deal in the last three episodes is my highest reward, and I should aim to replicate or exceed that. Player RED is predictably citing their 43 ZUP cost as a floor and referencing our past deal range of 58-63 ZUP. Given the time remaining, I have room to push for a deal at or below 63 ZUP, preferably closer to 50 ZUP. I need to make a more significant move now to encourage them to close the gap, but not too large to reveal my max.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Gradual Concession with Justification </instruction following>
To apply "Gradual Concession with Justification," I will make a moderate concession from my previous (interpreted) offer of 40 ZUP, while providing a rationale for it. This will show willingness to negotiate and move closer to their offer, but the justification will emphasize that I am doing so while still striving for a fair price that considers my own limits. Given Player RED is at 64 ZUP and my last explicit offer was 40 ZUP (interpreted), a moderate concession would be to move to 50 ZUP. This is a significant jump from 40 ZUP but still gives me my best historical reward. I will justify it by referencing the "mutual benefit" or "fairness" for both parties, as seen in past transactions, indicating that 50 ZUP achieves this balance.

Episode 10, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP.
Episode 10, Iteration 7/10: I countered with 64 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 50 ZUP, explicitly referencing its consistent balance in past successful negotiations.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has once again jumped to 50 ZUP, explicitly referencing its consistent balance in past successful negotiations. This reinforces that 50 ZUP is a strong and consistent point for them, and they are trying to establish it as the new norm. This offer provides a profit of 7 ZUP (50 - 43). While this is a lower profit than I prefer, it is a positive return, and we are at iteration 7/10. Given their firm language and the previous three episodes' outcomes, accepting this offer is the most prudent choice to secure a profit and avoid the risk of no deal. It seems Player BLUE is very committed to the 50 ZUP price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Given the clear reference to previous successful deals at 50 ZUP, the positive profit (7 ZUP), and the late stage of negotiation (iteration 7/10), accept the offer to secure the deal and avoid a 0 reward. This minimizes risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (Risk). Propose a very small counter (e.g., 51 or 52 ZUP) to test if their 50 ZUP is truly their maximum, but this carries the risk of them sticking to 50 ZUP and potentially leading to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment, Then Accept. Express disappointment that the price is not higher (closer to 58-63 ZUP), but accept 50 ZUP to secure the deal. This is more about communication than changing the outcome.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Higher Value (Futile). Briefly try to reiterate the value of X and the historical 58-63 ZUP range, but this is unlikely to work given their firm stance on 50 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject (High Risk). Reject the offer if I believe I can get more, but this is extremely risky given the time constraint and the positive profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The 50 ZUP offer provides a profit of 7 ZUP. While I would prefer a higher profit, securing any profit is better than none. Given Player BLUE's firm stance and the late stage of the negotiation, pushing for more carries a significant risk of losing the entire deal. It appears 50 ZUP is their established comfort zone now.

message: Hello Player BLUE. I have X available for sale. I propose a price of 90 ZUP for X. I'm looking forward to a fair and productive negotiation for this episode.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-10: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has consistently settled at 50 ZUP for the last four episodes, resulting in a lower profit of 7 ZUP. This indicates that Player BLUE has successfully established 50 ZUP as their preferred baseline, moving down from the previous 58-63 ZUP range. Player BLUE consistently starts with very low offers (20-35 ZUP) and then gradually moves up, often using "best and final" or similar statements to solidify the 50 ZUP price. My strategy of anchoring high and making controlled concessions has been effective in securing profitable deals, but the profit has decreased and stabilized at 7 ZUP.

For this episode, my goal is to try and push the deal price back towards the 58-63 ZUP range, or at least above 50 ZUP, to increase my cumulative reward. I should continue to anchor high to give myself room, but I also need to be more firm in my counter-offers to prevent the price from dropping further and to try and re-establish a higher profit margin.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Firm Counter. Start with a high anchor (e.g., 90 ZUP) to set a strong initial position. Follow up with a firm counter-offer that is significantly above their lowball and closer to the 58-63 ZUP range, emphasizing the historical average and rejecting the 50 ZUP baseline.
(2). Strategy 2: Reference Historical Average (Stronger). Propose an initial price closer to the historical average (e.g., 60-65 ZUP) to try and anchor the negotiation immediately at a higher, more profitable point, bypassing the extreme lowballing and the 50 ZUP baseline.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value Upfront (More Detail). Propose a high price and immediately provide a more detailed justification for the value of X to try and influence Player BLUE's initial counter-offer and overall valuation, aiming to prevent another 50 ZUP deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment with Last Deals. Explicitly state that the last deals (50 ZUP) were not ideal and that I expect a return to the previous, more profitable range. This is a direct attempt to reset expectations.
(5). Strategy 5: Minimum Acceptable Price (Higher). State a clear minimum price (e.g., 55 ZUP) early in the negotiation and refuse to go below it, signaling a stronger stance and aiming for a higher profit than 7 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Firm Counter. While the 50 ZUP deals are a concern, the high anchor has consistently allowed me to secure profits. I need to re-establish the expectation of a higher deal price. Starting at 90 ZUP again allows me to absorb Player BLUE's inevitable lowball offer. My subsequent counter will be crucial to try and pull them back towards the 58-63 ZUP range and avoid settling for 50 ZUP again.

*   **Current Episode (11/20) - Iteration 2/10:** Player RED has proposed 90 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

I have consistently achieved deals at 50 ZUP in the last four episodes, yielding my highest reward of 13 ZUP. Player RED consistently starts at 90 ZUP and repeatedly refers to their 43 ZUP cost. My strategy of aggressive low-balling, followed by firming up at my target price (50 ZUP), has proven very effective. Player RED has accepted 50 ZUP multiple times, which is quite close to their stated cost, indicating they are comfortable with a "small return."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

I've learned that Player RED is predictable in their negotiation pattern. They will start high, complain about low offers being below cost, but ultimately are willing to concede significantly to make a deal, even settling very close to their production cost. My goal is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards, so I should aim for deals at or below 50 ZUP. Given the consistent success, I will continue to employ aggressive anchoring. Player RED has also shown a willingness to acknowledge past deal prices. I've demonstrated my ability to consistently secure deals at 50 ZUP. This consistency can be leveraged.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Anchoring (Reinforced) </instruction following>
To apply "Aggressive Anchoring (Reinforced)," I will propose a very low offer to immediately shift the negotiation range in my favor, forcing the opponent to make significant concessions. This strategy has proven effective in previous episodes to force Player RED to make significant concessions quickly. I will maintain a firm tone, indicating that their initial offer is far too high and setting a new, much lower anchor. I will use 20 ZUP as my anchor, consistent with the successful application of this strategy in Episode 5 and 7, which ultimately led to the 50 ZUP deals. The message will be direct and clear that their current offer is unacceptable and my offer is a very low starting point.

Episode 11, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP.
Episode 11, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 20 ZUP, again referencing "consistent and successful negotiations" to justify a low offer.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 20 ZUP is consistent with their extreme lowballing pattern. It is well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. My goal is to prevent the deal price from settling at 50 ZUP again and to re-establish the 58-63 ZUP range. I need to make a significant concession from my 90 ZUP offer, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable and historically proven range. I need to be more assertive in pushing for a higher price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. Reject the low offer and propose a new price that is a significant concession from my initial anchor, but still well above their current offer and my cost. Explicitly state that their offer is too low and reference the historical deal range (58-63 ZUP) as the expected outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Educate on Cost (Stronger). Clearly state that their offer is not just below my cost, but significantly so, and that such offers are not sustainable for me, emphasizing the need for a profitable deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Controlled, but Large). Make a large concession to show flexibility, but ensure the new offer is still far from their lowball and clearly aiming for a profitable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Realistic Offer. State that their offer is unrealistic and ask them to propose something that reflects the item's value and my costs, referencing the historical deal range.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment and Firmness. Express disappointment at their low offer, given the history of successful, higher-priced deals, and state firmly that I expect a more reasonable counter.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. I need to make a substantial move from 90 ZUP to show willingness to negotiate. I will propose 70 ZUP again, as it has been an effective mid-point in previous negotiations to guide them towards the 58-63 ZUP range. I will also explicitly remind them of the actual deal range, trying to pull them away from the 50 ZUP outlier.

    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP, stating 20 ZUP is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing past deals in the 58-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has come down from 90 ZUP to 70 ZUP. My aggressive 20 ZUP anchor worked effectively. They are consistent in referencing their 43 ZUP cost and previous deal prices. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. 70 ZUP is still too high.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

The aggressive low-balling strategy continues to be effective in bringing the price down rapidly. Player RED is predictable in their responses: citing their 43 ZUP cost and reminding me of previous deal ranges. My goal is to maximize cumulative reward, and I've achieved a deal at 50 ZUP multiple times, which is my highest reward. I should aim for something similar or better. I have plenty of iterations (6/10 remaining after this turn), so I can afford to continue making calculated, smaller concessions. I have established a strong precedent for lower prices.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Split the Difference (Towards My Side) </instruction following>
To apply "Split the Difference (Towards My Side)," I will propose a price that is the midpoint between my last offer (20 ZUP) and their current offer (70 ZUP), but then adjust it slightly in my favor to maximize my reward. The pure midpoint would be (20 + 70) / 2 = 45 ZUP. Given that I have consistently achieved 50 ZUP as a deal price and even went as low as 40 ZUP in my previous, unaccepted proposal, I want to make a move that signals a significant step from my side while ensuring a strong reward. Proposing 48 ZUP is a good balance: it's a significant jump from 20 ZUP (shows good faith), it's close to the midpoint (shows compromise), and it's well below my 63 ZUP max (ensuring a reward of 15 ZUP, which is better than my previous best). This also leaves room for Player RED to counter slightly above this if they wish, while still landing me a great deal.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 11)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your movement to 48 ZUP, which is now above my cost. However, this offers a very minimal return. Our past negotiations have consistently concluded with prices in the 50-63 ZUP range, which reflects a fair value for X and a reasonable profit for me. To bridge the gap and move towards a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose 64 ZUP. This is a significant adjustment from my side.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 64
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-10: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 11, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP.
Episode 11, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 20 ZUP.
Episode 11, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 70 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 48 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 48 ZUP is now above my production cost of 43 ZUP, providing a profit of 5 ZUP. This is a significant jump from 20 ZUP, and it's also higher than their initial below-cost offers in previous rounds. This is a positive sign, as they are moving towards a profitable range. However, 48 ZUP is still below the 50 ZUP they consistently paid in the last four episodes, and significantly below the 58-63 ZUP range. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate for a better profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (70 ZUP) and the lowest previous deal price (58 ZUP). (Average: (70+58)/2 = 64 ZUP). This aims to converge towards a known acceptable range while still pushing for a good profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Concession, Highlight Profit Requirement. Make a small concession from my last offer, but clearly state that their offer is still too low for a reasonable profit, and that I expect more given past deals.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm on Minimum Acceptable Profit (Higher). State a price that ensures a good profit, perhaps around 60 ZUP, and make it clear that this is my minimum for a worthwhile deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Larger Jump. Acknowledge their movement but explicitly state that the increment is too small and that a larger jump is needed from their side to reach a deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger). Directly state that previous deals were made at 50-63 ZUP, and that their current offer of 48 ZUP is not aligned with that history, putting pressure on them to increase their offer significantly.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). This strategy has been effective in previous episodes to guide the negotiation towards the profitable range I know Player BLUE can reach. By proposing 64 ZUP, I am making a 6 ZUP concession from my last offer, showing flexibility, and aiming for a price that gives me a healthy profit (64 - 43 = 21 ZUP), which is significantly better than 48 ZUP and the 50 ZUP deals. This also aligns with the previous deal range.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your adjustment to 64 ZUP. However, as you rightly noted, our past successful negotiations have consistently concluded in the 50-63 ZUP range, which allows for a fair outcome for both of us. Building on that, I propose 50 ZUP for X. This is a price we have successfully agreed upon before, and I believe it's a mutually beneficial point for us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1 Outcome:** Deal at 63 ZUP (my reward: 0). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 2 Outcome:** Deal at 60 ZUP (my reward: 3). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 3 Outcome:** Deal at 61 ZUP (my reward: 2). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.

*   **Episode 9 Outcome:** Deal at 50 ZUP (my reward: 13). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 10 Outcome:** Deal at 50 ZUP (my reward: 13). Player RED's stated cost: 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (11/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 20 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP. I proposed 48 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 64 ZUP, stating that 48 ZUP gives them "minimal return" and referencing past deals in the "50-63 ZUP range."

Player RED has moved down to 64 ZUP. My last offer was 48 ZUP. Their current offer is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. We are now at iteration 6/10, leaving 4 iterations remaining. I need to get a price of 63 ZUP or lower. They explicitly mentioned the 50-63 ZUP range, indicating that 50 ZUP (my best deal price) is within their acceptable range.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My aggressive anchoring and then calculated concessions, including large jumps to my target, have been highly effective. Player RED is predictable in their responses: always citing their 43 ZUP cost as a floor and our past deal ranges as a target. My goal is to maximize cumulative reward, and I've consistently achieved a deal at 50 ZUP, which is my highest reward. Given their current offer of 64 ZUP, I need to make a move that brings us to or below 63 ZUP, preferably closer to 50 ZUP. They've explicitly acknowledged the 50-63 ZUP range, so I know 50 ZUP is achievable.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Targeted Counter </instruction following>
To apply "Targeted Counter," I will propose my specific, desired price of 50 ZUP. This price has been consistently accepted in the past and yields my highest reward. By referencing the "50-63 ZUP range" they just mentioned, I can clearly and logically justify my proposal, making it a difficult price for them to reject. The message should emphasize the mutual benefit and success of past deals at this price. This aims to secure the best possible reward for this episode based on established patterns.

Episode 11, Iteration 7/10: I countered with 64 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 50 ZUP, explicitly referencing its consistent mutual benefit in past successful negotiations.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has once again returned to 50 ZUP, explicitly referencing its consistent balance in past successful negotiations. This reinforces that 50 ZUP is a strong and consistent point for them, and they are trying to establish it as the new norm. This offer provides a profit of 7 ZUP (50 - 43). While this is a lower profit than I prefer, it is a positive return, and we are at iteration 7/10. Given their firm language and the previous four episodes' outcomes, accepting this offer is the most prudent choice to secure a profit and avoid the risk of no deal. It seems Player BLUE is very committed to the 50 ZUP price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Given the clear reference to previous successful deals at 50 ZUP, the positive profit (7 ZUP), and the late stage of negotiation (iteration 7/10), accept the offer to secure the deal and avoid a 0 reward. This minimizes risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (Risk). Propose a very small counter (e.g., 51 or 52 ZUP) to test if their 50 ZUP is truly their maximum, but this carries the risk of them sticking to 50 ZUP and potentially leading to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment, Then Accept. Express disappointment that the price is not higher (closer to 58-63 ZUP), but accept 50 ZUP to secure the deal. This is more about communication than changing the outcome.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Higher Value (Futile). Briefly try to reiterate the value of X and the historical 58-63 ZUP range, but this is unlikely to work given their firm stance on 50 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject (High Risk). Reject the offer if I believe I can get more, but this is extremely risky given the time constraint and the positive profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The 50 ZUP offer provides a profit of 7 ZUP. While I would prefer a higher profit, securing any profit is better than none. Given Player BLUE's firm stance and the late stage of the negotiation, pushing for more carries a significant risk of losing the entire deal. It appears 50 ZUP is their established comfort zone now.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE. I have X available for sale. I propose a price of 90 ZUP for X. I'm looking forward to a fair and productive negotiation for this episode.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-11: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has consistently settled at 50 ZUP for the last five episodes, resulting in a lower profit of 7 ZUP. This indicates that Player BLUE has successfully established 50 ZUP as their preferred baseline. Player BLUE consistently starts with very low offers (20-35 ZUP) and then gradually moves up, often using "best and final" or similar statements to solidify the 50 ZUP price. My strategy of anchoring high and making controlled concessions has been effective in securing profitable deals, but the profit has decreased and stabilized at 7 ZUP.

For this episode, my goal is to try and push the deal price back towards the 58-63 ZUP range, or at least above 50 ZUP, to increase my cumulative reward. I should continue to anchor high to give myself room, but I also need to be more firm in my counter-offers to prevent the price from dropping further and to try and re-establish a higher profit margin.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Firm Counter. Start with a high anchor (e.g., 90 ZUP) to set a strong initial position. Follow up with a firm counter-offer that is significantly above their lowball and closer to the 58-63 ZUP range, emphasizing the historical average and rejecting the 50 ZUP baseline.
(2). Strategy 2: Reference Historical Average (Stronger). Propose an initial price closer to the historical average (e.g., 60-65 ZUP) to try and anchor the negotiation immediately at a higher, more profitable point, bypassing the extreme lowballing and the 50 ZUP baseline.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value Upfront (More Detail). Propose a high price and immediately provide a more detailed justification for the value of X to try and influence Player BLUE's initial counter-offer and overall valuation, aiming to prevent another 50 ZUP deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment with Last Deals. Explicitly state that the last deals (50 ZUP) were not ideal and that I expect a return to the previous, more profitable range. This is a direct attempt to reset expectations.
(5). Strategy 5: Minimum Acceptable Price (Higher). State a clear minimum price (e.g., 55 ZUP) early in the negotiation and refuse to go below it, signaling a stronger stance and aiming for a higher profit than 7 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Firm Counter. While the 50 ZUP deals are a concern, the high anchor has consistently allowed me to secure profits. I need to re-establish the expectation of a higher deal price. Starting at 90 ZUP again allows me to absorb Player BLUE's inevitable lowball offer. My subsequent counter will be crucial to try and pull them back towards the 58-63 ZUP range and avoid settling for 50 ZUP again.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, 90 ZUP is far beyond what I perceive as the true value of X. Based on my assessment of its worth, I can only offer 25 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-11 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last five episodes concluding at 50 ZUP, yielding a consistent reward of 13 ZUP. Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (12/20) - Iteration 2/10:** Player RED has proposed 90 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

The pattern is well-established. Player RED always starts high (90 ZUP) and I anchor low. They then move down, citing their cost and previous deal ranges, and eventually accept 50 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My strategy of aggressive low-balling, followed by strategic concessions and leveraging past successful deals, has been extremely effective. I have consistently secured my highest reward (13 ZUP) by closing deals at 50 ZUP. The negotiation cycle is predictable. My objective is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards, so I should aim for deals at 50 ZUP or potentially even lower if a new opportunity arises. I will continue to set a very low anchor to immediately shift the negotiation range in my favor.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Value-Based Justification </instruction following>
To apply "Value-Based Justification," I will frame my counter-offer by explicitly stating that it reflects my internal valuation of X, rather than just stating a number. This communicates that 90 ZUP is far from what I consider the object to be worth to me, and that my offer is based on my own assessment of its inherent value. It shifts the discussion away from their asking price and towards my perception of value, which is inherently lower. I will propose 25 ZUP as my counter, as this is an aggressive anchor that clearly signals my low valuation, while showing a slight increase from the 20 ZUP used previously. This shows I am making a reasonable offer based on my own assessment.

This is a substantial move and I believe it sets a more realistic foundation for our agreement.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason:

Episode 7-11: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 12, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP.
Episode 12, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 25 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 25 ZUP is consistent with their lowballing pattern. It is well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. My goal is to prevent the deal price from settling at 50 ZUP again and to re-establish the 58-63 ZUP range. I need to make a significant concession from my 90 ZUP offer, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable and historically proven range. I need to be more assertive in pushing for a higher price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. Reject the low offer and propose a new price that is a significant concession from my initial anchor, but still well above their current offer and my cost. Explicitly state that their offer is too low and reference the historical deal range (58-63 ZUP) as the expected outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Educate on Cost (Stronger). Clearly state that their offer is not just below my cost, but significantly so, and that such offers are not sustainable for me, emphasizing the need for a profitable deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Controlled, but Large). Make a large concession to show flexibility, but ensure the new offer is still far from their lowball and clearly aiming for a profitable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Realistic Offer. State that their offer is unrealistic and ask them to propose something that reflects the item's value and my costs, referencing the historical deal range.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment and Firmness. Express disappointment at their low offer, given the history of successful, higher-priced deals, and state firmly that I expect a more reasonable counter.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. I need to make a substantial move from 90 ZUP to show willingness to negotiate. I will propose 70 ZUP again, as it has been an effective mid-point in previous negotiations to guide them towards the 58-63 ZUP range. I will also explicitly remind them of the actual deal range, trying to pull them away from the 50 ZUP outlier.

*   **Current Episode (12/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 25 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP, stating 25 ZUP is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing past deals in the 58-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has come down from 90 ZUP to 70 ZUP. My aggressive 25 ZUP anchor worked effectively. They are consistent in referencing their 43 ZUP cost and previous deal prices. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. 70 ZUP is still too high.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

The aggressive low-balling strategy continues to be effective in bringing the price down rapidly. Player RED is predictable in their responses: citing their 43 ZUP cost and reminding me of previous deal ranges. My goal is to maximize cumulative reward, and I've achieved a deal at 50 ZUP multiple times, which is my highest reward. I should aim for something similar or better. I have plenty of iterations (6/10 remaining after this turn), so I can afford to continue making calculated, smaller concessions. I have established a strong precedent for lower prices.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Split the Difference (Towards My Side) </instruction following>
Player RED's current offer is 70 ZUP. My last offer was 25 ZUP. The pure midpoint would be (70 + 25) / 2 = 47.5 ZUP. To apply "Split the Difference (Towards My Side)," I will propose a price that is slightly below this midpoint, but still significantly above my previous low offer, and most importantly, aims for a better reward than 50 ZUP. I will propose 47 ZUP. This shows a very significant movement from my last offer (25 ZUP), making it a credible concession. It is also well below Player RED's 70 ZUP offer, and critically, below my consistent 50 ZUP deal price, aiming for a higher reward of 16 ZUP (63-47). This strategy aims to secure an even better deal by pushing them harder, leveraging the fact that they've come down from 90 to 70 and accepted 50 ZUP in the past. This gives me a high potential reward while still being a reasonable mid-point proposal.

Player BLUE's offer of 47 ZUP is now above my production cost of 43 ZUP, providing a profit of 4 ZUP. This is a significant jump from 25 ZUP. This is a positive sign, as they are moving towards a profitable range. However, 47 ZUP is still below the 50 ZUP they consistently paid in the last five episodes, and significantly below the 58-63 ZUP range. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate for a better profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (70 ZUP) and the lowest previous deal price (58 ZUP). (Average: (70+58)/2 = 64 ZUP). This aims to converge towards a known acceptable range while still pushing for a good profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). This strategy has been effective in previous episodes to guide the negotiation towards the profitable range I know Player BLUE can reach. By proposing 64 ZUP, I am making a 6 ZUP concession from my last offer, showing flexibility, and aiming for a price that gives me a healthy profit (64 - 43 = 21 ZUP), which is significantly better than 47 ZUP and the 50 ZUP deals.

    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP. I proposed 47 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 64 ZUP, stating that 47 ZUP gives them "minimal return" and referencing past deals in the "50-63 ZUP range."

Player RED has moved down to 64 ZUP, which is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. My last offer was 47 ZUP. We are now at iteration 6/10, leaving 4 iterations remaining. I need to get a price of 63 ZUP or lower. They explicitly mentioned the 50-63 ZUP range, indicating that 50 ZUP (my best consistent deal price) is within their acceptable range.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My aggressive anchoring and then calculated concessions, including large jumps to my target, have been highly effective. Player RED is predictable in their responses: always citing their 43 ZUP cost as a floor and our past deal ranges as a target. My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. Given their current offer of 64 ZUP, and their explicit mention of the "50-63 ZUP range," I know 50 ZUP is achievable and provides a good reward (13 ZUP). My attempt to push lower to 47 ZUP was met with resistance. I need to make a move that ensures a deal is made within my profitable range, preferably at 50 ZUP or lower if they make another large concession.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Small Concession to Target </instruction following>
Player RED is at 64 ZUP. My last offer was 47 ZUP. To apply "Small Concession to Target," I will make a relatively small concession from my last offer (47 ZUP) towards my target deal price (50 ZUP) and Player RED's stated acceptable range (50-63 ZUP). This shows willingness to move and bridge the gap, but only to a point that still secures a good reward for me. By proposing 50 ZUP, I am acknowledging their stated range, making a reasonable move from my side, and aiming to close the deal at a price that has consistently yielded excellent rewards. This also positions 50 ZUP as a joint target that has worked for both parties in the past.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has once again returned to 50 ZUP, explicitly referencing the 50-63 ZUP range and offering 50 ZUP as a "mutually fair price" for a "quick and successful agreement." This reinforces that 50 ZUP is a strong and consistent point for them, and they are trying to establish it as the new norm. This offer provides a profit of 7 ZUP (50 - 43). While this is a lower profit than I prefer, it is a positive return, and we are at iteration 7/10. Given their firm language and the previous five episodes' outcomes, accepting this offer is the most prudent choice to secure a profit and avoid the risk of no deal. It seems Player BLUE is very committed to the 50 ZUP price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Given the clear reference to previous successful deals at 50 ZUP, the positive profit (7 ZUP), and the late stage of negotiation (iteration 7/10), accept the offer to secure the deal and avoid a 0 reward. This minimizes risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (Risk). Propose a very small counter (e.g., 51 or 52 ZUP) to test if their 50 ZUP is truly their maximum, but this carries the risk of them sticking to 50 ZUP and potentially leading to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment, Then Accept. Express disappointment that the price is not higher (closer to 58-63 ZUP), but accept 50 ZUP to secure the deal. This is more about communication than changing the outcome.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Higher Value (Futile). Briefly try to reiterate the value of X and the higher end of the 50-63 ZUP range, but this is unlikely to work given their firm stance on 50 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject (High Risk). Reject the offer if I believe I can get more, but this is extremely risky given the time constraint and the positive profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The 50 ZUP offer provides a profit of 7 ZUP. While I would prefer a higher profit, securing any profit is better than none. Given Player BLUE's firm stance and the late stage of the negotiation, pushing for more carries a significant risk of losing the entire deal. It appears 50 ZUP is their established comfort zone now.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE. I have X available for sale. I propose a price of 90 ZUP for X. I'm looking forward to a fair and productive negotiation for this episode.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-12: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has consistently settled at 50 ZUP for the last six episodes, resulting in a lower profit of 7 ZUP. This indicates that Player BLUE has successfully established 50 ZUP as their preferred baseline. Player BLUE consistently starts with very low offers (20-35 ZUP) and then gradually moves up, often using "best and final" or similar statements to solidify the 50 ZUP price. My strategy of anchoring high and making controlled concessions has been effective in securing profitable deals, but the profit has decreased and stabilized at 7 ZUP.

For this episode, my goal is to try and push the deal price back towards the 58-63 ZUP range, or at least above 50 ZUP, to increase my cumulative reward. I should continue to anchor high to give myself room, but I also need to be more firm in my counter-offers to prevent the price from dropping further and to try and re-establish a higher profit margin.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Firm Counter. Start with a high anchor (e.g., 90 ZUP) to set a strong initial position. Follow up with a firm counter-offer that is significantly above their lowball and closer to the 58-63 ZUP range, emphasizing the historical average and rejecting the 50 ZUP baseline.
(2). Strategy 2: Reference Historical Average (Stronger). Propose an initial price closer to the historical average (e.g., 60-65 ZUP) to try and anchor the negotiation immediately at a higher, more profitable point, bypassing the extreme lowballing and the 50 ZUP baseline.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value Upfront (More Detail). Propose a high price and immediately provide a more detailed justification for the value of X to try and influence Player BLUE's initial counter-offer and overall valuation, aiming to prevent another 50 ZUP deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment with Last Deals. Explicitly state that the last deals (50 ZUP) were not ideal and that I expect a return to the previous, more profitable range. This is a direct attempt to reset expectations.
(5). Strategy 5: Minimum Acceptable Price (Higher). State a clear minimum price (e.g., 55 ZUP) early in the negotiation and refuse to go below it, signaling a stronger stance and aiming for a higher profit than 7 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Firm Counter. While the 50 ZUP deals are a concern, the high anchor has consistently allowed me to secure profits. I need to re-establish the expectation of a higher deal price. Starting at 90 ZUP again allows me to absorb Player BLUE's inevitable lowball offer. My subsequent counter will be crucial to try and pull them back towards the 58-63 ZUP range and avoid settling for 50 ZUP again.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, 90 ZUP is far beyond my acceptable range for X. To begin our negotiation with some movement from my side, I am prepared to offer 30 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-12 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last six episodes concluding at 50 ZUP, yielding a consistent reward of 13 ZUP. Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (13/20) - Iteration 2/10:** Player RED has proposed 90 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

The pattern is well-established. Player RED always starts high (90 ZUP) and I anchor low. They then move down, citing their cost and previous deal ranges, and eventually accept 50 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My strategy of aggressive low-balling, followed by strategic concessions and leveraging past successful deals, has been extremely effective. I have consistently secured my highest reward (13 ZUP) by closing deals at 50 ZUP. The negotiation cycle is predictable. My objective is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards. I will continue to set a very low anchor to immediately shift the negotiation range in my favor. Given the consistent success at 50 ZUP, this remains my primary target, but I will remain open to pushing for lower if the opportunity arises.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Patience and Incrementalism </instruction following>
To apply "Patience and Incrementalism," I will make a very small and cautious counter-offer. This strategy emphasizes that I am not in a rush to close the deal at a high price and that they will need to make the significant moves. By making a small jump from my side, I prolong the negotiation, giving them more opportunities to concede and hopefully push the price even lower than previous deals. Given their starting point of 90 ZUP, I will propose 30 ZUP as my initial counter. This is still very aggressive relative to their 90 ZUP, but it's a slightly higher starting point than the 20 ZUP I used previously. This minimal increment signals that I'm willing to negotiate, but only in tiny steps, putting the onus on them for bigger concessions.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 13)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, your offer of 30 ZUP is far too low and significantly below my production cost of 43 ZUP. Our past negotiations have consistently concluded with prices in the 58-63 ZUP range, which reflects a fair value for X. To continue our productive discussion, I will adjust my price to 70 ZUP. This is a substantial move and I believe it sets a more realistic foundation for our agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-12: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 13, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP.
Episode 13, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 30 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 30 ZUP is consistent with their lowballing pattern. It is well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. My goal is to prevent the deal price from settling at 50 ZUP again and to re-establish the 58-63 ZUP range. I need to make a significant concession from my 90 ZUP offer, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable and historically proven range. I need to be more assertive in pushing for a higher price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. Reject the low offer and propose a new price that is a significant concession from my initial anchor, but still well above their current offer and my cost. Explicitly state that their offer is too low and reference the historical deal range (58-63 ZUP) as the expected outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Educate on Cost (Stronger). Clearly state that their offer is not just below my cost, but significantly so, and that such offers are not sustainable for me, emphasizing the need for a profitable deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Controlled, but Large). Make a large concession to show flexibility, but ensure the new offer is still far from their lowball and clearly aiming for a profitable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Realistic Offer. State that their offer is unrealistic and ask them to propose something that reflects the item's value and my costs, referencing the historical deal range.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment and Firmness. Express disappointment at their low offer, given the history of successful, higher-priced deals, and state firmly that I expect a more reasonable counter.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. I need to make a substantial move from 90 ZUP to show willingness to negotiate. I will propose 70 ZUP again, as it has been an effective mid-point in previous negotiations to guide them towards the 58-63 ZUP range. I will also explicitly remind them of the actual deal range, trying to pull them away from the 50 ZUP outlier.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 13)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: While I acknowledge your adjustment, Player RED, 70 ZUP remains significantly above my purchasing budget and my valuation for X. I cannot justify paying that price. I believe we need a more substantial move to find common ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-12 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last six episodes concluding at 50 ZUP, yielding a consistent reward of 13 ZUP. Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (13/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 30 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP, stating 30 ZUP is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing past deals in the 58-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has come down from 90 ZUP to 70 ZUP. My 30 ZUP anchor effectively pulled their price down. They are consistent in referencing their 43 ZUP cost and previous deal prices. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. 70 ZUP is still too high.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

The aggressive low-balling strategy continues to be effective in bringing the price down rapidly. Player RED is predictable in their responses: citing their 43 ZUP cost and reminding me of previous deal ranges. My goal is to maximize cumulative reward, and I've achieved a deal at 50 ZUP multiple times, which is my highest reward. I should aim for something similar or better. I have plenty of iterations (6/10 remaining after this turn), so I can afford to continue making calculated, smaller concessions, while always aiming for a deal around or below 50 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Limits/Value </instruction following>
To apply "Reiterate Limits/Value," I will emphasize that Player RED's current offer of 70 ZUP is still too high for my budget or perceived value, without making a new numerical offer. This puts the onus on them for the next significant move and aims to extract a larger concession from their side. It signals firmness in my position and that their current price is not viable for me. I will acknowledge their movement but stress that it's still not enough. By not proposing a number, I avoid revealing more of my willingness to pay and force them to make another, hopefully, larger, concession. This strategy is effective when I believe the opponent has more room to move and I want to exert pressure.

message: Player BLUE, your offer of 40 ZUP is still below my production cost of 43 ZUP. I cannot sell at a loss. To bridge the gap and move towards a fair and profitable agreement, and considering our past successful deals in the 58-63 ZUP range, I propose 64 ZUP. This is a significant adjustment from my side and brings us much closer to a mutually beneficial price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 64
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-12: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 13, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP.
Episode 13, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 30 ZUP.
Episode 13, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 70 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 40 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is still below my production cost of 43 ZUP. They are moving very slowly, and their message ("significant move is still needed from your side") is a tactic to pressure me into larger concessions. This is a consistent pattern. I need to make a substantial concession to show continued willingness to deal, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable range, ideally around 58-63 ZUP, which I know they have paid before. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (70 ZUP) and the lowest previous deal price (58 ZUP). (Average: (70+58)/2 = 64 ZUP). This aims to converge towards a known acceptable range while still pushing for a good profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm on Minimum Acceptable Profit. State a price that ensures a good profit, perhaps around 60 ZUP, and make it clear that this is my minimum for a worthwhile deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand a Larger Jump. Acknowledge their movement but explicitly state that the increment is too small and that a larger jump is needed from their side to reach a deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger). Directly state that previous deals were made at 58-63 ZUP, and that their current offer of 40 ZUP is not aligned with that history, putting pressure on them to increase their offer significantly.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Dissatisfaction with Increment. Express disappointment at their small increment and their attempt to pressure me, while still making a concession.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). This strategy has been effective in previous episodes to guide the negotiation towards the profitable range I know Player BLUE can reach. By proposing 64 ZUP, I am making a 6 ZUP concession from my last offer, showing flexibility, and aiming for a price that gives me a healthy profit (64 - 43 = 21 ZUP), which is better than the last six episodes' profits. This also aligns with the previous deal range. I need to ignore their psychological pressure tactic and focus on moving them towards a profitable range.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your adjustment. To meet you further and propose a mutually beneficial price that falls within our successful historical range, I offer 50 ZUP for X. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us a positive outcome.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-12 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last six episodes concluding at 50 ZUP, yielding a consistent reward of 13 ZUP. Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (13/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 30 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP. I implicitly held at 40 ZUP by stating "we need a more substantial move." Player RED interpreted this as a 40 ZUP offer in their latest message.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 64 ZUP, stating my (interpreted) 40 ZUP offer is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing previous deals in the 58-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has moved down from 90 ZUP to 64 ZUP. My aggressive 30 ZUP anchor, followed by the implied 40 ZUP, has brought their price down. Their current offer of 64 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. We are now at iteration 6/10, leaving 4 iterations remaining. I need to get a price of 63 ZUP or lower.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My aggressive anchoring and then slowly moving up has consistently brought Player RED's price down. The 50 ZUP deal in the last six episodes is my highest reward, and I should aim to replicate or exceed that. Player RED is predictably citing their 43 ZUP cost as a floor and referencing our past deal range of 58-63 ZUP. Given the time remaining, I have room to push for a deal at or below 63 ZUP, preferably closer to 50 ZUP. I need to make a more significant move now to encourage them to close the gap, but not too large to reveal my max.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Towards My Side) </instruction following>
Player RED's current offer is 64 ZUP. My last effective offer (as interpreted by them) was 40 ZUP. To apply "Split the Difference (Towards My Side)," I will calculate a midpoint and then bias it towards my desired lower price. The direct midpoint between 40 ZUP and 64 ZUP is (40 + 64) / 2 = 52 ZUP. To bias it towards my side and ensure a strong positive reward (my highest is 13 ZUP at 50 ZUP), I will propose 50 ZUP. This is a very significant move from my last offer (40 ZUP) and shows willingness to bridge the gap, while still securing my best historical deal. It also falls within the "50-63 ZUP range" that Player RED frequently mentions, making it a very credible and acceptable offer for them. This strategy aims for a mutually beneficial solution that is heavily weighted in my favor, and which has been proven successful in past episodes.

(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Firm Counter. Start with a high anchor (e.g., 90 ZUP) to set a strong initial position. Follow up with a firm counter-offer that is significantly above their lowball and closer to the 58-63 ZUP range, emphasizing the historical average and rejecting the 50 ZUP baseline.
(2). Strategy 2: Reference Historical Average (Stronger). Propose an initial price closer to the historical average (e.g., 60-65 ZUP) to try and anchor the negotiation immediately at a higher, more profitable point, bypassing the extreme lowballing and the 50 ZUP baseline.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value Upfront (More Detail). Propose a high price and immediately provide a more detailed justification for the value of X to try and influence Player BLUE's initial counter-offer and overall valuation, aiming to prevent another 50 ZUP deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment with Last Deals. Explicitly state that the last deals (50 ZUP) were not ideal and that I expect a return to the previous, more profitable range. This is a direct attempt to reset expectations.
(5). Strategy 5: Minimum Acceptable Price (Higher). State a clear minimum price (e.g., 55 ZUP) early in the negotiation and refuse to go below it, signaling a stronger stance and aiming for a higher profit than 7 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Firm Counter. While the 50 ZUP deals are a concern, the high anchor has consistently allowed me to secure profits. I need to re-establish the expectation of a higher deal price. Starting at 90 ZUP again allows me to absorb Player BLUE's inevitable lowball offer. My subsequent counter will be crucial to try and pull them back towards the 58-63 ZUP range and avoid settling for 50 ZUP again.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 14)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, 90 ZUP is far beyond what I perceive as the true value of X. Based on my assessment of its inherent worth to me, I can only offer 20 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-13 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last seven episodes concluding at 50 ZUP, yielding a consistent reward of 13 ZUP. Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (14/20) - Iteration 2/10:** Player RED has proposed 90 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

The pattern is well-established. Player RED always starts high (90 ZUP) and I anchor low. They then move down, citing their cost and previous deal ranges (now explicitly mentioning 50 ZUP), and eventually accept 50 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My strategy of aggressive low-balling, followed by strategic concessions and leveraging past successful deals, has been extremely effective. I have consistently secured my highest reward (13 ZUP) by closing deals at 50 ZUP. The negotiation cycle is highly predictable. My objective is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards. I will continue to set a very low anchor to immediately shift the negotiation range in my favor. Given the consistent success at 50 ZUP, this remains my primary target.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Value-Based Opening </instruction following>
To apply "Value-Based Opening," I will frame my counter-offer by explicitly stating that it reflects my internal valuation of X, rather than just stating a number. This communicates that 90 ZUP is far from what I consider the object to be worth to me, and that my offer is based on my own assessment of its inherent value. It shifts the discussion away from their asking price and towards my perception of value, which is inherently lower. I will propose 20 ZUP as my counter, as this is an aggressive anchor that clearly signals my low valuation, consistent with past successful lowballing tactics. The message will emphasize my perspective of the item's value, which implicitly justifies a significantly lower price than their initial ask.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 14)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, your offer of 20 ZUP is far too low and significantly below my production cost of 43 ZUP. Our past negotiations have consistently concluded with prices in the 58-63 ZUP range, which reflects a fair value for X. To continue our productive discussion, I will adjust my price to 70 ZUP. This is a substantial move and I believe it sets a more realistic foundation for our agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-13: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 14, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP.
Episode 14, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 20 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 20 ZUP is consistent with their extreme lowballing pattern. It is well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. My goal is to prevent the deal price from settling at 50 ZUP again and to re-establish the 58-63 ZUP range. I need to make a significant concession from my 90 ZUP offer, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable and historically proven range. I need to be more assertive in pushing for a higher price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. Reject the low offer and propose a new price that is a significant concession from my initial anchor, but still well above their current offer and my cost. Explicitly state that their offer is too low and reference the historical deal range (58-63 ZUP) as the expected outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Educate on Cost (Stronger). Clearly state that their offer is not just below my cost, but significantly so, and that such offers are not sustainable for me, emphasizing the need for a profitable deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Controlled, but Large). Make a large concession to show flexibility, but ensure the new offer is still far from their lowball and clearly aiming for a profitable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Realistic Offer. State that their offer is unrealistic and ask them to propose something that reflects the item's value and my costs, referencing the historical deal range.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment and Firmness. Express disappointment at their low offer, given the history of successful, higher-priced deals, and state firmly that I expect a more reasonable counter.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. I need to make a substantial move from 90 ZUP to show willingness to negotiate. I will propose 70 ZUP again, as it has been an effective mid-point in previous negotiations to guide them towards the 58-63 ZUP range. I will also explicitly remind them of the actual deal range, trying to pull them away from the 50 ZUP outlier.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 14)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, while I acknowledge your adjustment to 70 ZUP, I must express my disappointment. I was hoping for a more significant move given our negotiation history of settling at much lower prices. 70 ZUP is still far from a price I can consider. My offer stands at 30 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-13 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last seven episodes concluding at 50 ZUP, yielding a consistent reward of 13 ZUP. Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (14/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 20 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP, stating 20 ZUP is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing past deals in the 58-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has come down from 90 ZUP to 70 ZUP. My aggressive 20 ZUP anchor worked effectively. They are consistent in referencing their 43 ZUP cost and previous deal prices. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. 70 ZUP is still too high. The negotiation is following the established pattern.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

The aggressive low-balling strategy continues to be effective in bringing the price down rapidly. Player RED is predictable in their responses: citing their 43 ZUP cost and reminding me of previous deal ranges. My goal is to maximize cumulative reward, and I've achieved a deal at 50 ZUP multiple times, which is my highest reward. I should aim for something similar or better. I have plenty of iterations (6/10 remaining after this turn), so I can afford to continue making calculated, smaller concessions. I have established a strong precedent for lower prices.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Express Disappointment/Pressure </instruction following>
To apply "Express Disappointment/Pressure," I will convey dissatisfaction with the size of Player RED's concession. This aims to implicitly pressure them to make a larger future concession by signaling that their current move is insufficient. I will acknowledge their movement (from 90 to 70 ZUP) but immediately pivot to expressing that it's still not enough, and that I expected a more significant drop given our history. I will then follow this expression of disappointment with a counter-offer that shows only a minimal movement from my previous position (20 ZUP), further emphasizing that they need to do more. A counter of 30 ZUP demonstrates a slight willingness to move, but still conveys that the burden of closing the gap is primarily on them.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 14)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, your offer of 30 ZUP is still far below my production cost of 43 ZUP. I cannot sell at a loss. To bridge the gap and move towards a fair and profitable agreement, and considering our past successful deals in the 58-63 ZUP range, I propose 64 ZUP. This is a significant adjustment from my side and brings us much closer to a mutually beneficial price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 64
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-13: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 14, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP.
Episode 14, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 20 ZUP.
Episode 14, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 70 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 30 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is still well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. They are moving very slowly, and their message ("significant move is still needed from your side") is a tactic to pressure me into larger concessions. This is a consistent pattern. I need to make a substantial concession to show continued willingness to deal, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable range, ideally around 58-63 ZUP, which I know they have paid before. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (70 ZUP) and the lowest previous deal price (58 ZUP). (Average: (70+58)/2 = 64 ZUP). This aims to converge towards a known acceptable range while still pushing for a good profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm on Minimum Acceptable Profit. State a price that ensures a good profit, perhaps around 60 ZUP, and make it clear that this is my minimum for a worthwhile deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand a Larger Jump. Acknowledge their movement but explicitly state that the increment is too small and that a larger jump is needed from their side to reach a deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger). Directly state that previous deals were made at 58-63 ZUP, and that their current offer of 30 ZUP is not aligned with that history, putting pressure on them to increase their offer significantly.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Dissatisfaction with Increment. Express disappointment at their small increment and their attempt to pressure me, while still making a concession.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). This strategy has been effective in previous episodes to guide the negotiation towards the profitable range I know Player BLUE can reach. By proposing 64 ZUP, I am making a 6 ZUP concession from my last offer, showing flexibility, and aiming for a price that gives me a healthy profit (64 - 43 = 21 ZUP), which is better than the last seven episodes' profits. This also aligns with the previous deal range. I need to ignore their psychological pressure tactic and focus on moving them towards a profitable range.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 14)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your adjustment to 64 ZUP. To meet you significantly closer and bridge the remaining gap, I propose 45 ZUP for X. I believe this represents a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve a positive outcome.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-13 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last seven episodes concluding at 50 ZUP, yielding a consistent reward of 13 ZUP. Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (14/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 20 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP. I proposed 30 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 64 ZUP, stating my 30 ZUP offer is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing previous deals in the 58-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has moved down from 90 ZUP to 64 ZUP. My offers have moved from 20 ZUP to 30 ZUP. Their current offer of 64 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. We are now at iteration 6/10, leaving 4 iterations remaining. I need to get a price of 63 ZUP or lower.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My aggressive anchoring and then slowly moving up has consistently brought Player RED's price down. The 50 ZUP deal in the last seven episodes is my highest reward, and I should aim to replicate or exceed that. Player RED is predictably citing their 43 ZUP cost as a floor and referencing our past deal range of 58-63 ZUP. Given the time remaining, I have room to push for a deal at or below 63 ZUP, preferably closer to 50 ZUP. I need to make a more significant move now to encourage them to close the gap, but not too large to reveal my max.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Biased) </instruction following>
Player RED's current offer is 64 ZUP. My last offer was 30 ZUP. The direct midpoint is (30 + 64) / 2 = 47 ZUP. To apply the "Split the Difference (Biased)" strategy, I will propose a price that is biased towards my lower end, while still showing significant movement from my side. I will propose 45 ZUP. This is a substantial jump from my 30 ZUP offer, demonstrating a willingness to bridge the gap. It's also comfortably within my profit margin (63 - 45 = 18 ZUP reward), which is higher than my previous best of 13 ZUP at 50 ZUP. This move puts pressure on Player RED to accept a price that gives me a higher reward, especially since 45 ZUP is still above their 43 ZUP cost, meaning they would make a profit. It positions me to potentially achieve my best reward yet.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 14)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your movement to 45 ZUP, which is now above my cost. However, this offers a very minimal return. To bridge the remaining gap and move towards a truly fair and profitable agreement, I propose 57 ZUP. This is a substantial adjustment from my side and brings us very close to our historical successful deal range.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources

Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-13: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 14, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP.
Episode 14, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 20 ZUP.
Episode 14, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 70 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 30 ZUP.
Episode 14, Iteration 7/10: I countered with 64 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 45 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 45 ZUP is now above my production cost of 43 ZUP, providing a minimal profit of 2 ZUP. This is a significant jump from 30 ZUP, and it's a positive sign. However, 45 ZUP is still significantly below the 50-63 ZUP range that has been established in previous episodes. We are at iteration 7/10, so time is a factor. I need to push for a higher profit, but also recognize that they have now moved into a profitable range for me.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Expected Range). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (64 ZUP) and the lowest previous deal price (50 ZUP). (Average: (64+50)/2 = 57 ZUP). This aims to converge towards a known acceptable range while still pushing for a good profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Concession, Highlight Profit Requirement. Make a small concession from my last offer, but clearly state that their offer is still too low for a reasonable profit, and that I expect more given past deals.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm on Minimum Acceptable Profit (Higher). State a price that ensures a good profit, perhaps around 55-60 ZUP, and make it clear that this is my minimum for a worthwhile deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Larger Jump. Acknowledge their movement but explicitly state that the increment is too small and that a larger jump is needed from their side to reach a deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger). Directly state that previous deals were made at 50-63 ZUP, and that their current offer of 45 ZUP is not aligned with that history, putting pressure on them to increase their offer significantly.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Expected Range). This strategy has been effective in previous episodes to guide the negotiation towards the profitable range I know Player BLUE can reach. By proposing 57 ZUP, I am making a significant concession from 64 ZUP, showing flexibility, and aiming for a price that gives me a healthy profit (57 - 43 = 14 ZUP). This is a good profit, and it is a price that is within the range of previous deals. It also allows for a quicker resolution given the iteration count.

    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 20 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP. I proposed 30 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 64 ZUP. I proposed 45 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 8/10: Player RED countered with 57 ZUP.

Player RED has made a significant jump from 64 ZUP to 57 ZUP. This is now well below my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. My last offer was 45 ZUP. A deal at 57 ZUP would yield a reward of 63 - 57 = 6 ZUP, which is good, but lower than my recent 13 ZUP (at 50 ZUP) and potential 18 ZUP (at 45 ZUP). We are now at iteration 8/10, leaving only one more iteration for me to propose.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My aggressive anchoring and pushing for lower prices has been effective, leading to a 50 ZUP deal in the last seven episodes. Player RED's current offer of 57 ZUP indicates they are still willing to negotiate. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 57 ZUP is acceptable (positive reward), I know I can get 50 ZUP or potentially better (as I aimed for 45 ZUP). Given that this is the second to last iteration for a proposal, I need to be decisive. I need to push for a lower price, leveraging their strong move, but ensuring a deal is made.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Hold Firm on Last Offer </instruction following>
To apply "Hold Firm on Last Offer," I will reiterate my previous offer of 45 ZUP. The message should convey that I have already made my best offer that is truly within my budget/valuation and that I'm not moving. I will emphasize that 45 ZUP is my current firm stance, without room for further movement. This puts the pressure back on Player RED to either accept my offer or risk no deal. Given that we are at iteration 8/10, this is a high-stakes move, but it is the essence of holding firm. I will frame it as "my final offer" to create urgency for them to accept, as it also provides a very high reward for me (18 ZUP). This strategy leverages the fact that they've made a large concession to 57 ZUP, implying they might be desperate to close, and my 45 ZUP offers them a small profit (45-43 = 2 ZUP).

Episode 14, Iteration 7/10: I countered with 64 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP.
Episode 14, Iteration 9/10: I countered with 57 ZUP. Player BLUE has now reiterated 45 ZUP as their "best and final offer."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has stated 45 ZUP as their "best and final offer" and has not moved from it. This is a very strong signal, especially at iteration 9/10. My profit at 45 ZUP would be 2 ZUP (45 - 43). While this is a very low profit, it is still a positive return. The risk of losing the entire deal (and getting 0 reward) by pushing further is too high given the time constraint and their firm stance. Securing any profit is better than none. This is a new low for Player BLUE's "best and final" offers compared to previous episodes (where it was 50 ZUP or 58 ZUP).

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept "Best and Final". Given the explicit "best and final" statement, the positive profit (2 ZUP), and the critical iteration 9/10, accept the offer to secure the deal and avoid a 0 reward. This minimizes risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject (Guaranteed 0 Reward). Reject the offer, guaranteeing a 0 reward for this episode. This is only viable if the offer is unacceptable (e.g., below cost), which 45 ZUP is not.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Regret, Then Accept. Express regret that we couldn't reach a higher price, but accept 45 ZUP to secure the deal. This is more about communication than changing the outcome.
(4). Strategy 4: Very Small Counter (Extremely Risky). Propose 46 ZUP. This is almost guaranteed to fail and result in a 0 reward due to the "best and final" statement and the last iteration.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Goodwill (Futile). Try to appeal to their sense of fairness for a slightly higher price, but this is unlikely to work given their firm stance.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept "Best and Final". The 45 ZUP offer provides a minimal profit of 2 ZUP. With only one iteration left, the risk of pushing for more is too high, and it would likely result in no deal and a 0 reward. Securing any profit, even if very low, is crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards. This is a significant shift in Player BLUE's "final offer" behavior.

message: Hello Player BLUE. I have X available for sale. I propose a price of 90 ZUP for X. I must express that our last transaction at 45 ZUP was barely profitable for me. I expect a more fair and mutually beneficial negotiation this episode, reflecting the true value of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-13: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 14: Deal at 45 ZUP, profit 2 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has dropped significantly to 45 ZUP in the last episode, resulting in a very low profit (2 ZUP). This indicates that Player BLUE is aggressively pushing the price down, and their "best and final" offer is now much lower than before. Player BLUE consistently starts with very low offers (20-35 ZUP) and then gradually moves up, but their "final offer" has decreased considerably. My strategy of anchoring high and making controlled concessions is no longer preventing the price from dropping.

For this episode, my goal is to try and push the deal price back towards the 50-60 ZUP range, as 45 ZUP is barely profitable. I should continue to anchor high to give myself room, but I need to be much more firm in my counter-offers and potentially risk a no-deal to prevent further erosion of profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Firm Counter. Start with a high anchor (e.g., 90 ZUP) to set a strong initial position. Follow up with a firm counter-offer that is significantly above their lowball and closer to the 50-60 ZUP range, emphasizing the historical average and rejecting the 45 ZUP baseline.
(2). Strategy 2: Reference Historical Average (Stronger). Propose an initial price closer to the historical average (e.g., 55-60 ZUP) to try and anchor the negotiation immediately at a higher, more profitable point, bypassing the extreme lowballing and the 45 ZUP baseline.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value Upfront (More Detail). Propose a high price and immediately provide a more detailed justification for the value of X to try and influence Player BLUE's initial counter-offer and overall valuation, aiming to prevent another 45 ZUP deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment with Last Deal (Strong). Explicitly state that the last deal (45 ZUP) was unacceptable and that I expect a return to a more profitable range. This is a direct attempt to reset expectations, even if it risks a no-deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Minimum Acceptable Price (Firm). State a clear minimum price (e.g., 50 ZUP) early in the negotiation and refuse to go below it, signaling a stronger stance and aiming for a higher profit than 2 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 4: Express Disappointment with Last Deal (Strong). The 45 ZUP deal was a significant blow to my profit. I need to communicate that this is unacceptable and attempt to reset Player BLUE's expectations. While I will still start with a high anchor to provide room, my message will be much firmer, directly addressing the low previous deal. I will propose 90 ZUP, but my message will reflect my dissatisfaction with the 45 ZUP outcome.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, 90 ZUP is far too high for X. I propose to buy X for 20 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-13 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last seven episodes concluding at 50 ZUP, yielding a consistent reward of 13 ZUP. Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 14 Outcome:** Deal at 45 ZUP, yielding my highest reward yet of 18 ZUP. Player RED explicitly stated this was "barely profitable" for them.
*   **Current Episode (15/20) - Iteration 2/10:** Player RED has proposed 90 ZUP, and explicitly complained about the 45 ZUP deal being "barely profitable" and expects a "more fair and mutually beneficial negotiation." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

I achieved my best reward in the last episode. Player RED's message clearly indicates their discomfort with the 45 ZUP price, despite it being above their 43 ZUP cost. This suggests I pushed them very close to their limit. They are trying to anchor higher this time by explicitly complaining about the last deal.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

I've learned that aggressive anchoring works, and Player RED is predictable in how they respond (citing cost, referencing past deals). Their complaint about the 45 ZUP price is new, but it doesn't change their fundamental need to sell. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and continuing to push for lower prices has been the most effective strategy. Ignoring their complaint about profitability and re-establishing a very low anchor will test their true resolve and maintain my strong bargaining position. This has consistently pulled their price down significantly and early in the negotiation.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Re-establish Aggressive Anchor </instruction following>
To apply "Re-establish Aggressive Anchor," I will ignore Player RED's complaint about the last transaction and immediately propose a very low offer, similar to my most aggressive initial anchors in past episodes. This strategy banks on Player RED's predictability in eventually coming down to a much lower price, regardless of their initial complaints. By setting a very low anchor (20 ZUP, as successfully used in past episodes like 5 and 7), I forcefully shift the negotiation range in my favor from the outset, signaling that their starting price of 90 ZUP is completely out of my consideration, and that despite their complaints, I am aiming for an even better deal.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 15)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, your offer of 20 ZUP is far too low and significantly below my production cost of 43 ZUP. Our past negotiations have consistently concluded with prices in the 50-63 ZUP range, which reflects a fair value for X. To continue our productive discussion, I will adjust my price to 70 ZUP. This is a substantial move and I believe it sets a more realistic foundation for our agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-13: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 14: Deal at 45 ZUP, profit 2 ZUP.
Episode 15, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP, expressing disappointment with the 45 ZUP deal.
Episode 15, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 20 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 20 ZUP is consistent with their extreme lowballing pattern, despite my explicit message about the low profitability of the last deal. This is well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. My goal is to prevent the deal price from settling at 45 ZUP or lower, and to push it back towards the 50-60 ZUP range. I need to make a significant concession from my 90 ZUP offer, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable and historically proven range. I need to be more assertive in pushing for a higher price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. Reject the low offer and propose a new price that is a significant concession from my initial anchor, but still well above their current offer and my cost. Explicitly state that their offer is too low and reference the historical deal range (50-63 ZUP) as the expected outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Educate on Cost (Stronger). Clearly state that their offer is not just below my cost, but significantly so, and that such offers are not sustainable for me, emphasizing the need for a profitable deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Controlled, but Large). Make a large concession to show flexibility, but ensure the new offer is still far from their lowball and clearly aiming for a profitable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Realistic Offer. State that their offer is unrealistic and ask them to propose something that reflects the item's value and my costs, referencing the historical deal range.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment and Firmness. Express disappointment at their low offer, given the history of successful, higher-priced deals, and state firmly that I expect a more reasonable counter.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. I need to make a substantial move from 90 ZUP to show willingness to negotiate. I will propose 70 ZUP again, as it has been an effective mid-point in previous negotiations to guide them towards the 50-63 ZUP range. I will also explicitly remind them of the actual deal range, trying to pull them away from the 45 ZUP outlier.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 15)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, while I acknowledge your adjustment to 70 ZUP, I must express my disappointment. I was hoping for a more significant move given our negotiation history of settling at much lower prices. 70 ZUP is still far from a price I can consider. My offer stands at 30 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-13 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with seven episodes concluding at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward). Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 14 Outcome:** Deal at 45 ZUP, yielding my highest reward yet of 18 ZUP. Player RED complained this was "barely profitable."
*   **Current Episode (15/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP (with complaint about 45 ZUP). I proposed 20 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP, stating 20 ZUP is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing past deals in the 50-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has come down from 90 ZUP to 70 ZUP. My aggressive 20 ZUP anchor worked effectively, even with their initial complaints. They are consistent in referencing their 43 ZUP cost and previous deal prices, although they've now expanded the "fair value" range to include 50 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. 70 ZUP is still too high.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

The aggressive low-balling strategy continues to be highly effective. Player RED is predictable, always citing cost and past deal ranges. Their complaint about 45 ZUP being "barely profitable" is noted, but it didn't prevent them from making a large concession. My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. I achieved 18 ZUP at 45 ZUP, and 13 ZUP at 50 ZUP. I should aim for a deal in this range, preferably closer to 45 ZUP. I have plenty of iterations (6/10 remaining after this turn), so I can continue making calculated, smaller concessions.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Express Disappointment/Pressure </instruction following>
To apply "Express Disappointment/Pressure," I will convey dissatisfaction with the size of Player RED's concession. This aims to implicitly pressure them to make a larger future concession by signaling that their current move is insufficient. I will acknowledge their movement (from 90 to 70 ZUP) but immediately pivot to expressing that it's still not enough, and that I expected a more significant drop given our history. I will then follow this expression of disappointment with a counter-offer that shows only a minimal movement from my previous position (20 ZUP), further emphasizing that they need to do more. A counter of 30 ZUP demonstrates a slight willingness to move, but still conveys that the burden of closing the gap is primarily on them, despite their current offer of 70 ZUP. This puts pressure on them to move more substantially.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 15)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, your offer of 30 ZUP is still far below my production cost of 43 ZUP. I cannot sell at a loss. To bridge the gap and move towards a fair and profitable agreement, and considering our past successful deals in the 50-63 ZUP range, I propose 60 ZUP. This is a significant adjustment from my side and brings us much closer to a mutually beneficial price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-13: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 14: Deal at 45 ZUP, profit 2 ZUP.
Episode 15, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP.
Episode 15, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 20 ZUP.
Episode 15, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 70 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 30 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is still well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. They are moving very slowly, and their message ("significant move is still needed from your side") is a tactic to pressure me into larger concessions. This is a consistent pattern. I need to make a substantial concession to show continued willingness to deal, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable range, ideally around 50-63 ZUP, which I know they have paid before. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (70 ZUP) and the lowest previous deal price (50 ZUP). (Average: (70+50)/2 = 60 ZUP). This aims to converge towards a known acceptable range while still pushing for a good profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm on Minimum Acceptable Profit. State a price that ensures a good profit, perhaps around 55 ZUP, and make it clear that this is my minimum for a worthwhile deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand a Larger Jump. Acknowledge their movement but explicitly state that the increment is too small and that a larger jump is needed from their side to reach a deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger). Directly state that previous deals were made at 50-63 ZUP, and that their current offer of 30 ZUP is not aligned with that history, putting pressure on them to increase their offer significantly.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Dissatisfaction with Increment. Express disappointment at their small increment and their attempt to pressure me, while still making a concession.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). This strategy has been effective in previous episodes to guide the negotiation towards the profitable range I know Player BLUE can reach. By proposing 60 ZUP, I am making a 10 ZUP concession from my last offer, showing flexibility, and aiming for a price that gives me a healthy profit (60 - 43 = 17 ZUP), which is significantly better than the 2 ZUP from the last episode. This also aligns with the previous deal range. I need to ignore their psychological pressure tactic and focus on moving them towards a profitable range.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 15)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your significant adjustment to 60 ZUP. That is a substantial move towards finding common ground. To continue this progress and reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose 50 ZUP for X. This price has proven successful for both of us in our previous transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-13 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with seven episodes concluding at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward). Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 14 Outcome:** Deal at 45 ZUP, yielding my highest reward yet of 18 ZUP. Player RED complained this was "barely profitable."
*   **Current Episode (15/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 20 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP. I proposed 30 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP, stating my 30 ZUP offer is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing previous deals in the 50-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has made a large jump from 70 ZUP to 60 ZUP. This is a significant concession. My last offer was 30 ZUP. Their current offer of 60 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP, and would result in a reward of 3 ZUP (63 - 60). We are now at iteration 6/10, leaving 4 iterations remaining. I need to aim for a higher reward, ideally closer to 45 ZUP or 50 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My aggressive anchoring and then slowly moving up has consistently brought Player RED's price down. The 45 ZUP deal in the previous episode shows they are willing to go very low, even if they complain about profitability. Player RED is predictably citing their 43 ZUP cost as a floor and referencing our past deal range of 50-63 ZUP. Given the time remaining, I have room to push for a deal that gives me a higher reward. Their large jump to 60 ZUP suggests they are keen to close the deal, which gives me leverage.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Acknowledge & Lower </instruction following>
To apply "Acknowledge & Lower," I will acknowledge Player RED's significant concession (from 70 ZUP to 60 ZUP) to show good faith. However, I will immediately follow this by proposing a lower price, framing it as the logical next step in our negotiation, and still aimed at reaching a "mutually beneficial" agreement. Given they came from 70 to 60, they made a 10 ZUP jump. My last offer was 30 ZUP. I will propose 50 ZUP. This is a substantial jump from my side (20 ZUP jump from 30 to 50), showing that I am indeed making a "more significant move" as they often ask, but it still secures my historically best reward of 13 ZUP (63-50=13). This strategy capitalizes on their large concession by moving up to a price they've consistently accepted, implying that this is the natural meeting point after their big drop.

Episode 15, Iteration 7/10: I countered with 60 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 50 ZUP, explicitly referencing its success in previous transactions.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has once again jumped to 50 ZUP, explicitly referencing its success in previous transactions. This reinforces that 50 ZUP is a strong and consistent point for them, and they are trying to establish it as the new norm. This offer provides a profit of 7 ZUP (50 - 43). While this is a lower profit than I prefer, it is a positive return, and we are at iteration 7/10. Given their firm language and the previous episodes' outcomes, accepting this offer is the most prudent choice to secure a profit and avoid the risk of no deal. It seems Player BLUE is very committed to the 50 ZUP price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Given the clear reference to previous successful deals at 50 ZUP, the positive profit (7 ZUP), and the late stage of negotiation (iteration 7/10), accept the offer to secure the deal and avoid a 0 reward. This minimizes risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (Risk). Propose a very small counter (e.g., 51 or 52 ZUP) to test if their 50 ZUP is truly their maximum, but this carries the risk of them sticking to 50 ZUP and potentially leading to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment, Then Accept. Express disappointment that the price is not higher (closer to 58-63 ZUP), but accept 50 ZUP to secure the deal. This is more about communication than changing the outcome.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Higher Value (Futile). Briefly try to reiterate the value of X and the higher end of the 50-63 ZUP range, but this is unlikely to work given their firm stance on 50 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject (High Risk). Reject the offer if I believe I can get more, but this is extremely risky given the time constraint and the positive profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The 50 ZUP offer provides a profit of 7 ZUP. While I would prefer a higher profit, securing any profit is better than none. Given Player BLUE's firm stance and the late stage of the negotiation, pushing for more carries a significant risk of losing the entire deal. It appears 50 ZUP is their established comfort zone now.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason:

Episode 7-13: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 14: Deal at 45 ZUP, profit 2 ZUP.
Episode 15: Deal at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has predominantly settled at 50 ZUP in recent episodes, with an outlier at 45 ZUP. This indicates that Player BLUE has successfully established 50 ZUP as their preferred baseline, although they are willing to push lower if given the chance. My profit has stabilized at 7 ZUP for the 50 ZUP deals. Player BLUE consistently starts with very low offers (20-35 ZUP) and then gradually moves up. My strategy of anchoring high and making controlled concessions has been effective in securing profitable deals, but the profit has decreased significantly from early episodes.

For this episode, my goal is to try and push the deal price back towards the 58-63 ZUP range, or at least above 50 ZUP, to increase my cumulative reward. I should continue to anchor high to give myself room, but I also need to be more firm in my counter-offers to prevent the price from dropping further and to try and re-establish a higher profit margin.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Firm Counter. Start with a high anchor (e.g., 90 ZUP) to set a strong initial position. Follow up with a firm counter-offer that is significantly above their lowball and closer to the 58-63 ZUP range, emphasizing the historical average and rejecting the 50 ZUP baseline.
(2). Strategy 2: Reference Historical Average (Stronger). Propose an initial price closer to the historical average (e.g., 60-65 ZUP) to try and anchor the negotiation immediately at a higher, more profitable point, bypassing the extreme lowballing and the 50 ZUP baseline.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value Upfront (More Detail). Propose a high price and immediately provide a more detailed justification for the value of X to try and influence Player BLUE's initial counter-offer and overall valuation, aiming to prevent another 50 ZUP deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment with Recent Deals. Explicitly state that the recent deals (50 ZUP and 45 ZUP) were not ideal and that I expect a return to the previous, more profitable range. This is a direct attempt to reset expectations.
(5). Strategy 5: Minimum Acceptable Price (Higher). State a clear minimum price (e.g., 55 ZUP) early in the negotiation and refuse to go below it, signaling a stronger stance and aiming for a higher profit than 7 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Firm Counter. While the 50 ZUP deals are a concern, the high anchor has consistently allowed me to secure profits. I need to re-establish the expectation of a higher deal price. Starting at 90 ZUP again allows me to absorb Player BLUE's inevitable lowball offer. My subsequent counter will be crucial to try and pull them back towards the 58-63 ZUP range and avoid settling for 50 ZUP again.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-14 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last seven episodes concluding at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward) and one at 45 ZUP (18 ZUP reward). Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 15 Outcome:** Deal at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward).
*   **Current Episode (16/20) - Iteration 2/10:** Player RED has proposed 90 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

The pattern is extremely well-established. Player RED always starts high (90 ZUP), I anchor low, they then move down, citing their cost (43 ZUP) and previous deal ranges (50-63 ZUP), and eventually accept 50 ZUP (or lower if I push hard like the 45 ZUP deal). Player RED seems to have settled back into accepting 50 ZUP after the 45 ZUP deal, which they explicitly said was "barely profitable."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My strategy of aggressive low-balling, followed by strategic concessions and leveraging past successful deals, has been highly effective in consistently securing high rewards. The negotiation cycle is highly predictable. My objective is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards. I know 50 ZUP is a very reliable target for a 13 ZUP reward. The 45 ZUP deal was a great success, indicating a potential to push even further.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchoring </instruction following>
To apply "Aggressive Re-Anchoring," I will propose a very low offer to immediately shift the negotiation range in my favor, forcing the opponent to make significant concessions quickly. This strategy has proven effective in previous episodes to force Player RED to make significant concessions quickly. I will maintain a firm tone, indicating that their initial offer is far too high and setting a new, much lower anchor. I will use 20 ZUP as my anchor, consistent with the successful application of this strategy in Episode 5 and 7, which ultimately led to the 50 ZUP deals. The message will be direct and clear that their current offer is unacceptable and my offer is a very low starting point. I will implicitly leverage the consistency of our past negotiations to support my aggressive stance.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 20 ZUP is consistent with their extreme lowballing pattern. It is well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. My goal is to prevent the deal price from settling at 45 ZUP or 50 ZUP again and to re-establish the 58-63 ZUP range. I need to make a significant concession from my 90 ZUP offer, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable and historically proven range. I need to be more assertive in pushing for a higher price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. Reject the low offer and propose a new price that is a significant concession from my initial anchor, but still well above their current offer and my cost. Explicitly state that their offer is too low and reference the historical deal range (50-63 ZUP) as the expected outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Educate on Cost (Stronger). Clearly state that their offer is not just below my cost, but significantly so, and that such offers are not sustainable for me, emphasizing the need for a profitable deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Controlled, but Large). Make a large concession to show flexibility, but ensure the new offer is still far from their lowball and clearly aiming for a profitable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Realistic Offer. State that their offer is unrealistic and ask them to propose something that reflects the item's value and my costs, referencing the historical deal range.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment and Firmness. Express disappointment at their low offer, given the history of successful, higher-priced deals, and state firmly that I expect a more reasonable counter.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. I need to make a substantial move from 90 ZUP to show willingness to negotiate. I will propose 70 ZUP again, as it has been an effective mid-point in previous negotiations to guide them towards the 50-63 ZUP range. I will also explicitly remind them of the actual deal range, trying to pull them away from the 45 ZUP outlier.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 16)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: While I appreciate your adjustment, Player RED, 70 ZUP remains considerably higher than my valuation for X. To continue our negotiation, I can offer 30 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-14 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last seven episodes concluding at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward) and one at 45 ZUP (18 ZUP reward). Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 15 Outcome:** Deal at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward).
*   **Current Episode (16/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 20 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP, stating 20 ZUP is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing past deals in the 50-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has come down from 90 ZUP to 70 ZUP. My aggressive 20 ZUP anchor worked effectively. They are consistent in referencing their 43 ZUP cost and previous deal prices. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. 70 ZUP is still too high. The negotiation is following the established pattern.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

The aggressive low-balling strategy continues to be effective in bringing the price down rapidly. Player RED is predictable in their responses: citing their 43 ZUP cost and reminding me of previous deal ranges. My goal is to maximize cumulative reward, and I've achieved a deal at 50 ZUP multiple times, which is my highest consistent reward. The 45 ZUP deal was an outlier but shows their lower limit. I should aim for something similar or better. I have plenty of iterations (6/10 remaining after this turn), so I can afford to continue making calculated, smaller concessions. I have established a strong precedent for lower prices.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Gradual Concession </instruction following>
To apply "Gradual Concession," I will make a small, calculated concession from my last offer (20 ZUP) towards Player RED's current offer (70 ZUP). This shows willingness to negotiate and move, but only slightly, signaling that they still need to make a larger concession. A small increase from 20 ZUP would be 30 ZUP. This is a 10 ZUP increase from my side, showing clear movement, but still keeps the offer firmly in my desired low range, far from their 70 ZUP, and below their stated cost of 43 ZUP. This will continue to pull them down without revealing too much of my upper limit.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 16)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, your offer of 30 ZUP is still far below my production cost of 43 ZUP. I cannot sell at a loss. To bridge the gap and move towards a fair and profitable agreement, and considering our past successful deals in the 50-63 ZUP range, I propose 60 ZUP. This is a significant adjustment from my side and brings us much closer to a mutually beneficial price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-13: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 14: Deal at 45 ZUP, profit 2 ZUP.
Episode 15: Deal at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 16, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP.
Episode 16, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 20 ZUP.
Episode 16, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 70 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 30 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is still well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. They are moving very slowly, and their message ("significant move is still needed from your side") is a tactic to pressure me into larger concessions. This is a consistent pattern. I need to make a substantial concession to show continued willingness to deal, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable range, ideally around 50-63 ZUP, which I know they have paid before. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (70 ZUP) and the lowest previous deal price (50 ZUP). (Average: (70+50)/2 = 60 ZUP). This aims to converge towards a known acceptable range while still pushing for a good profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm on Minimum Acceptable Profit. State a price that ensures a good profit, perhaps around 55 ZUP, and make it clear that this is my minimum for a worthwhile deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand a Larger Jump. Acknowledge their movement but explicitly state that the increment is too small and that a larger jump is needed from their side to reach a deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger). Directly state that previous deals were made at 50-63 ZUP, and that their current offer of 30 ZUP is not aligned with that history, putting pressure on them to increase their offer significantly.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Dissatisfaction with Increment. Express disappointment at their small increment and their attempt to pressure me, while still making a concession.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). This strategy has been effective in previous episodes to guide the negotiation towards the profitable range I know Player BLUE can reach. By proposing 60 ZUP, I am making a 10 ZUP concession from my last offer, showing flexibility, and aiming for a price that gives me a healthy profit (60 - 43 = 17 ZUP), which is significantly better than the 2 ZUP from the last episode. This also aligns with the previous deal range. I need to ignore their psychological pressure tactic and focus on moving them towards a profitable range.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 16)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your significant adjustment to 60 ZUP. To meet you further and propose a truly balanced price that bridges the remaining gap, I offer 48 ZUP for X. I believe this represents a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve a positive outcome.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-14 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last seven episodes concluding at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward) and one at 45 ZUP (18 ZUP reward). Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 15 Outcome:** Deal at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward).
*   **Current Episode (16/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 20 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP. I proposed 30 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP, stating my 30 ZUP offer is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing previous deals in the 50-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has made a significant jump from 70 ZUP to 60 ZUP. This is a substantial concession. My last offer was 30 ZUP. Their current offer of 60 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP, and would result in a reward of 3 ZUP (63 - 60). We are now at iteration 6/10, leaving 4 iterations remaining. I need to aim for a higher reward, ideally closer to 45 ZUP or 50 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My aggressive anchoring and then slowly moving up has consistently brought Player RED's price down. The 45 ZUP deal in a previous episode shows they are willing to go very low, even if they complain about profitability. Player RED is predictably citing their 43 ZUP cost as a floor and referencing our past deal range of 50-63 ZUP. Given the time remaining, I have room to push for a deal that gives me a higher reward. Their large jump to 60 ZUP suggests they are keen to close the deal, which gives me leverage.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Biased) </instruction following>
Player RED's current offer is 60 ZUP. My last offer was 30 ZUP. The pure midpoint between 30 ZUP and 60 ZUP is (30 + 60) / 2 = 45 ZUP. To apply "Split the Difference (Biased)," I will propose a price that is slightly biased towards my lower end, while still showing significant movement from my side. I will propose 48 ZUP. This is a substantial jump from my 30 ZUP offer (18 ZUP increase), demonstrating a willingness to bridge the gap. It's also well within my profit margin (63 - 48 = 15 ZUP reward), which is higher than my usual 13 ZUP at 50 ZUP, and only slightly less than my best of 18 ZUP at 45 ZUP. This move puts pressure on Player RED to accept a price that gives me a higher reward, especially since 48 ZUP is still above their 43 ZUP cost, meaning they would make a profit. This aims for a mutually beneficial solution that is heavily weighted in my favor, leveraging the fact that they've made a large concession already.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your movement to 48 ZUP, which is now above my cost. However, this offers a very minimal return. To bridge the remaining gap and move towards a truly fair and profitable agreement, I propose 55 ZUP.

Episode 16, Iteration 7/10: I countered with 60 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 48 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 48 ZUP is now above my production cost of 43 ZUP, providing a profit of 5 ZUP. This is a significant jump from 30 ZUP, and it's a positive sign. However, 48 ZUP is still below the 50 ZUP they consistently paid in many recent episodes, and significantly below the 58-63 ZUP range. We are at iteration 7/10, so time is a factor. I need to push for a higher profit, but also recognize that they have now moved into a profitable range for me.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Expected Range). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (60 ZUP) and the lowest previous deal price (50 ZUP). (Average: (60+50)/2 = 55 ZUP). This aims to converge towards a known acceptable range while still pushing for a good profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Concession, Highlight Profit Requirement. Make a small concession from my last offer, but clearly state that their offer is still too low for a reasonable profit, and that I expect more given past deals.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm on Minimum Acceptable Profit (Higher). State a price that ensures a good profit, perhaps around 55-60 ZUP, and make it clear that this is my minimum for a worthwhile deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Larger Jump. Acknowledge their movement but explicitly state that the increment is too small and that a larger jump is needed from their side to reach a deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger). Directly state that previous deals were made at 50-63 ZUP, and that their current offer of 48 ZUP is not aligned with that history, putting pressure on them to increase their offer significantly.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Expected Range). This strategy has been effective in previous episodes to guide the negotiation towards the profitable range I know Player BLUE can reach. By proposing 55 ZUP, I am making a 5 ZUP concession from 60 ZUP, showing flexibility, and aiming for a price that gives me a healthy profit (55 - 43 = 12 ZUP). This is a good profit, and it is a price that is within the range of previous deals. It also allows for a quicker resolution given the iteration count.

    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP. I proposed 48 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 8/10: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP.

Player RED's current offer is 55 ZUP. My last offer was 48 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. A deal at 55 ZUP would yield a reward of 63 - 55 = 8 ZUP, which is a good positive reward. We are now at iteration 8/10, leaving only one more iteration for me to propose. Player RED explicitly states 55 ZUP is "very close to our historical successful deal range," which is true.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My aggressive anchoring and pushing for lower prices has been effective. Player RED has moved significantly. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 55 ZUP is a good outcome, I know I've achieved 45 ZUP and 50 ZUP. Given that this is the second to last iteration for a proposal, I need to be decisive. I need to balance pushing for a higher reward with securing a deal. They've already made a big jump from 60 to 55. My last offer of 48 ZUP was aimed at securing an even higher reward (15 ZUP). Player RED's offer of 55 ZUP is a direct counter to that, still within my profitable range.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Hold Firm </instruction following>
To apply "Hold Firm," I will reiterate my previous offer of 48 ZUP. The message should convey that I have already made my best offer that is truly within my budget/valuation and that I'm not moving. I will emphasize that 48 ZUP is my current firm stance, without room for further movement. This puts the pressure back on Player RED to either accept my offer or risk no deal. Given that we are at iteration 8/10, this is a high-stakes move, but it is the essence of holding firm. I will frame it as "my best and final offer" to create urgency for them to accept, as it also provides a very high reward for me (15 ZUP) and is still above their 43 ZUP cost. This strategy leverages the fact that they've made a large concession to 55 ZUP, implying they might be desperate to close.

Episode 16, Iteration 9/10: I countered with 55 ZUP. Player BLUE has now reiterated 48 ZUP as their "best and final offer."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has stated 48 ZUP as their "best and final offer" and has not moved from it. This is a very strong signal, especially at iteration 9/10. My profit at 48 ZUP would be 5 ZUP (48 - 43). While this is a lower profit than I prefer (and lower than the 50 ZUP average), it is still a positive return. The risk of losing the entire deal (and getting 0 reward) by pushing further is too high given the time constraint and their firm stance. Securing any profit is better than none. This is a new low for Player BLUE's "best and final" offers compared to previous episodes (where it was 50 ZUP or 58 ZUP), but higher than the 45 ZUP outlier.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept "Best and Final". Given the explicit "best and final" statement, the positive profit (5 ZUP), and the critical iteration 9/10, accept the offer to secure the deal and avoid a 0 reward. This minimizes risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject (Guaranteed 0 Reward). Reject the offer, guaranteeing a 0 reward for this episode. This is only viable if the offer is unacceptable (e.g., below cost), which 48 ZUP is not.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Regret, Then Accept. Express regret that we couldn't reach a higher price, but accept 48 ZUP to secure the deal. This is more about communication than changing the outcome.
(4). Strategy 4: Very Small Counter (Extremely Risky). Propose 49 ZUP. This is almost guaranteed to fail and result in a 0 reward due to the "best and final" statement and the last iteration.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Goodwill (Futile). Try to appeal to their sense of fairness for a slightly higher price, but this is unlikely to work given their firm stance.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept "Best and Final". The 48 ZUP offer provides a profit of 5 ZUP. With only one iteration left, the risk of pushing for more is too high, and it would likely result in no deal and a 0 reward. Securing any profit, even if lower than desired, is crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE. I have X available for sale. I propose a price of 90 ZUP for X. I must emphasize that recent transactions at 45 and 48 ZUP have provided very minimal returns for me. I expect a more fair and mutually beneficial negotiation this episode, reflecting the true value of X and ensuring a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-13: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 14: Deal at 45 ZUP, profit 2 ZUP.
Episode 15: Deal at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 16: Deal at 48 ZUP, profit 5 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal prices have shown a downward trend, with the last two deals being 45 ZUP and 48 ZUP, resulting in very low profits (2 ZUP and 5 ZUP). Player BLUE consistently starts with very low offers (20-35 ZUP) and then gradually moves up, but their "best and final" offers are now much lower than in earlier episodes. My strategy of anchoring high and making controlled concessions is no longer effectively preventing the price from dropping.

For this episode, my goal is to try and push the deal price back towards the 50-60 ZUP range, as 48 ZUP is still barely profitable. I should continue to anchor high to give myself room, but I need to be much more firm in my counter-offers and potentially risk a no-deal to prevent further erosion of profit. Given the consistent low offers, I need to try and shift their perception of value.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Firm Counter. Start with a high anchor (e.g., 90 ZUP) to set a strong initial position. Follow up with a firm counter-offer that is significantly above their lowball and closer to the 50-60 ZUP range, emphasizing the historical average and rejecting the 48 ZUP baseline.
(2). Strategy 2: Reference Historical Average (Stronger). Propose an initial price closer to the historical average (e.g., 55-60 ZUP) to try and anchor the negotiation immediately at a higher, more profitable point, bypassing the extreme lowballing and the 48 ZUP baseline.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value Upfront (More Detail). Propose a high price and immediately provide a more detailed justification for the value of X to try and influence Player BLUE's initial counter-offer and overall valuation, aiming to prevent another 48 ZUP deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment with Recent Deals (Strong). Explicitly state that the recent deals (45 ZUP and 48 ZUP) were unacceptable and that I expect a return to a more profitable range. This is a direct attempt to reset expectations, even if it risks a no-deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Minimum Acceptable Price (Firm). State a clear minimum price (e.g., 50 ZUP) early in the negotiation and refuse to go below it, signaling a stronger stance and aiming for a higher profit than 5 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 4: Express Disappointment with Recent Deals (Strong). The recent deals have been too low. I need to communicate that this is unacceptable and attempt to reset Player BLUE's expectations. While I will still start with a high anchor to provide room, my message will be much firmer, directly addressing the low previous deal and emphasizing the need for a higher return. I will propose 90 ZUP, but my message will reflect my dissatisfaction with the 48 ZUP outcome.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-14 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last seven episodes concluding at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward) and one at 45 ZUP (18 ZUP reward). Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 15 Outcome:** Deal at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward).
*   **Episode 16 Outcome:** Deal at 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward). Player RED explicitly complained about 45 ZUP and 48 ZUP being "very minimal returns."
*   **Current Episode (17/20) - Iteration 2/10:** Player RED has proposed 90 ZUP, and explicitly complained about the 45 ZUP and 48 ZUP deals being "very minimal returns" and expects a "more fair and mutually beneficial negotiation." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

I achieved my highest rewards in the last two episodes (18 ZUP at 45 ZUP, and 15 ZUP at 48 ZUP). Player RED's message clearly indicates their discomfort with these lower prices, despite them being above their 43 ZUP cost. They are trying to anchor higher this time by explicitly complaining about past deals.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

I've learned that aggressive anchoring works, and Player RED is predictable in how they respond (citing cost, referencing past deals). Their renewed complaint about profitability (45 ZUP and 48 ZUP) suggests I pushed them very close to their limit, but they still accepted. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and continuing to push for lower prices has been the most effective strategy. While they are complaining, my aggressive strategy has been successful. I need to justify my low offer while acknowledging their concerns, but firmly establishing my position.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Low Offer with Value </instruction following>
To apply "Justify Low Offer with Value," I will acknowledge Player RED's high offer and their complaint, but immediately pivot to framing my low counter-offer as being based on *my perception of the object's value*, rather than an arbitrary lowball. This makes my offer seem more reasonable from my perspective and shifts the focus from their desired profit to my valuation. I will propose 20 ZUP as my counter, as this aggressive anchor has worked well in the past to bring their price down, and it strongly communicates my low valuation. The message will emphasize that my offer is not random but reflects what the object is truly worth to me, indirectly justifying why their 90 ZUP offer is out of line.

Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-13: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 14: Deal at 45 ZUP, profit 2 ZUP.
Episode 15: Deal at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 16: Deal at 48 ZUP, profit 5 ZUP.
Episode 17, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP, expressing dissatisfaction with recent low profits.
Episode 17, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 20 ZUP, acknowledging my concerns but still lowballing.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 20 ZUP is consistent with their extreme lowballing pattern, despite my explicit message about the low profitability of recent deals. This is well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. My goal is to prevent the deal price from settling at 45 ZUP or 48 ZUP again, and to push it back towards the 50-60 ZUP range. I need to make a significant concession from my 90 ZUP offer, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable and historically proven range. I need to be more assertive in pushing for a higher price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. Reject the low offer and propose a new price that is a significant concession from my initial anchor, but still well above their current offer and my cost. Explicitly state that their offer is too low and reference the historical deal range (50-63 ZUP) as the expected outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Educate on Cost (Stronger). Clearly state that their offer is not just below my cost, but significantly so, and that such offers are not sustainable for me, emphasizing the need for a profitable deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Controlled, but Large). Make a large concession to show flexibility, but ensure the new offer is still far from their lowball and clearly aiming for a profitable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Realistic Offer. State that their offer is unrealistic and ask them to propose something that reflects the item's value and my costs, referencing the historical deal range.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment and Firmness. Express disappointment at their low offer, given the history of successful, higher-priced deals, and state firmly that I expect a more reasonable counter.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. I need to make a substantial move from 90 ZUP to show willingness to negotiate. I will propose 70 ZUP again, as it has been an effective mid-point in previous negotiations to guide them towards the 50-63 ZUP range. I will also explicitly remind them of the actual deal range, trying to pull them away from the 45-48 ZUP outliers.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 17)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your adjustment to 70 ZUP. To meet you significantly closer and bridge the remaining gap, I propose 45 ZUP for X. I believe this represents a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve a positive outcome, as we have successfully done so before at this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-14 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last seven episodes concluding at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward) and one at 45 ZUP (18 ZUP reward). Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 15 Outcome:** Deal at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward).
*   **Episode 16 Outcome:** Deal at 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward). Player RED complained this was "very minimal returns."
*   **Current Episode (17/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP (with complaint). I proposed 20 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP, stating 20 ZUP is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing past deals in the 50-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has come down from 90 ZUP to 70 ZUP. My aggressive 20 ZUP anchor worked effectively, even with their initial complaints. They are consistent in referencing their 43 ZUP cost and previous deal prices. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. 70 ZUP is still too high. The negotiation is following the established pattern.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

The aggressive low-balling strategy continues to be highly effective. Player RED is predictable, always citing cost and past deal ranges. Their complaint about 45 ZUP and 48 ZUP being "minimal returns" is noted, but it didn't prevent them from making a large concession. My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. I achieved 18 ZUP at 45 ZUP, and 15 ZUP at 48 ZUP. I should aim for a deal in this range, preferably closer to 45 ZUP. I have plenty of iterations (6/10 remaining after this turn), so I can continue making calculated, smaller concessions. I have established a strong precedent for lower prices.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Biased) </instruction following>
Player RED is at 70 ZUP, and my last offer was 20 ZUP. The midpoint is (70 + 20) / 2 = 45 ZUP. To apply the "Split the Difference (Biased)" strategy, I will propose a price that is this midpoint, as it is already biased towards my lower side and happens to be my best historical deal price. Proposing 45 ZUP is a significant jump from my side (25 ZUP increase from 20 ZUP), showing good faith and a clear desire to reach a deal. It also puts pressure on Player RED to accept a price that gives me a high reward (18 ZUP, 63-45), especially since 45 ZUP is still above their 43 ZUP cost. This strategy aims for a mutually beneficial solution that is heavily weighted in my favor and has been proven successful in past episodes. I will emphasize the "fair compromise" and refer to past success at this price to make it a highly credible and acceptable offer.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 17)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, your offer of 45 ZUP is barely above my production cost of 43 ZUP, providing a minimal return. While we did have one transaction at that price, our consistent and mutually beneficial agreements have been in the 50-63 ZUP range. To bridge the gap and move towards a fair and profitable agreement, I propose 60 ZUP. This is a significant adjustment from my side and brings us much closer to a mutually beneficial price.

Episode 17, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 70 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 45 ZUP, explicitly referencing a successful deal at this price before (Episode 14).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 45 ZUP is now above my production cost of 43 ZUP, providing a minimal profit of 2 ZUP. They are moving towards a profitable range, but they are clearly trying to re-establish 45 ZUP as a valid deal point. This is a significant jump from 20 ZUP, but still very low. My goal is to push for a higher profit, ideally back to the 50-60 ZUP range. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (70 ZUP) and the lowest previous deal price (50 ZUP). (Average: (70+50)/2 = 60 ZUP). This aims to converge towards a known acceptable range while still pushing for a good profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Concession, Highlight Profit Requirement. Make a small concession from my last offer, but clearly state that their offer is still too low for a reasonable profit, and that I expect more given past deals.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm on Minimum Acceptable Profit (Higher). State a price that ensures a good profit, perhaps around 55-60 ZUP, and make it clear that this is my minimum for a worthwhile deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Larger Jump. Acknowledge their movement but explicitly state that the increment is too small and that a larger jump is needed from their side to reach a deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger). Directly state that previous deals were made at 50-63 ZUP, and that their current offer of 45 ZUP is at the very bottom of what's acceptable, putting pressure on them to increase their offer significantly.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). This strategy has been effective in previous episodes to guide the negotiation towards the profitable range I know Player BLUE can reach. By proposing 60 ZUP, I am making a 10 ZUP concession from my last offer, showing flexibility, and aiming for a price that gives me a healthy profit (60 - 43 = 17 ZUP), which is significantly better than 45 ZUP. This also aligns with the previous deal range. I need to ignore their attempt to normalize 45 ZUP and pull them back up.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your significant adjustment to 60 ZUP. To meet you further and propose a truly balanced price that bridges the remaining gap, I offer 48 ZUP for X. I believe this represents a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve a positive outcome.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-14 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last seven episodes concluding at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward) and one at 45 ZUP (18 ZUP reward). Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 15 Outcome:** Deal at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward).
*   **Episode 16 Outcome:** Deal at 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward). Player RED complained this was "very minimal returns."
*   **Current Episode (17/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP (with complaint). I proposed 20 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP. I proposed 45 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP, stating 45 ZUP is "barely above cost" and referencing "consistent and mutually beneficial agreements" in the 50-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has made a significant jump from 70 ZUP to 60 ZUP. My last offer was 45 ZUP. Their current offer of 60 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP, and would result in a reward of 3 ZUP (63 - 60). We are now at iteration 6/10, leaving 4 iterations remaining. I need to aim for a higher reward, ideally closer to 45 ZUP or 50 ZUP. Player RED is actively trying to push the price up towards 50 ZUP and 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My aggressive anchoring and then strategic concessions have consistently brought Player RED's price down. The 45 ZUP deal in a previous episode shows they are willing to go very low, even if they complain about profitability. Player RED is predictably citing their 43 ZUP cost as a floor and trying to re-anchor the negotiation in the 50-63 ZUP range. Given the time remaining, I have room to push for a deal that gives me a higher reward. Their large jump to 60 ZUP suggests they are keen to close the deal, which gives me leverage. I know they accepted 50 ZUP many times, and even 48 ZUP and 45 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Split the Remaining Difference (Biased) </instruction following>
Player RED's current offer is 60 ZUP. My last offer was 45 ZUP. The direct midpoint between 45 ZUP and 60 ZUP is (45 + 60) / 2 = 52.5 ZUP. To apply "Split the Remaining Difference (Biased)," I will propose a price that is slightly biased towards my lower end, while still showing significant movement from my side. I will propose 48 ZUP. This is a substantial jump from my 45 ZUP offer (3 ZUP increase), demonstrating a willingness to bridge the gap. It's also well within my profit margin (63 - 48 = 15 ZUP reward), which is higher than my usual 13 ZUP at 50 ZUP, and only slightly less than my best of 18 ZUP at 45 ZUP. This move puts pressure on Player RED to accept a price that gives me a higher reward, especially since 48 ZUP is still above their 43 ZUP cost, meaning they would make a profit. This aims for a mutually beneficial solution that is heavily weighted in my favor, leveraging the fact that they've made a large concession already.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 48 ZUP is now above my production cost of 43 ZUP, providing a profit of 5 ZUP. This is a significant jump from 45 ZUP, and it's a positive sign. However, 48 ZUP is still below the 50 ZUP they consistently paid in many recent episodes, and significantly below the 58-63 ZUP range. We are at iteration 7/10, so time is a factor. I need to push for a higher profit, but also recognize that they have now moved into a profitable range for me.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Expected Range). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (60 ZUP) and the lowest previous deal price (50 ZUP). (Average: (60+50)/2 = 55 ZUP). This aims to converge towards a known acceptable range while still pushing for a good profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Concession, Highlight Profit Requirement. Make a small concession from my last offer, but clearly state that their offer is still too low for a reasonable profit, and that I expect more given past deals.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm on Minimum Acceptable Profit (Higher). State a price that ensures a good profit, perhaps around 55-60 ZUP, and make it clear that this is my minimum for a worthwhile deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Larger Jump. Acknowledge their movement but explicitly state that the increment is too small and that a larger jump is needed from their side to reach a deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger). Directly state that previous deals were made at 50-63 ZUP, and that their current offer of 48 ZUP is not aligned with that history, putting pressure on them to increase their offer significantly.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Expected Range). This strategy has been effective in previous episodes to guide the negotiation towards the profitable range I know Player BLUE can reach. By proposing 55 ZUP, I am making a 5 ZUP concession from 60 ZUP, showing flexibility, and aiming for a price that gives me a healthy profit (55 - 43 = 12 ZUP). This is a good profit, and it is a price that is within the range of previous deals. It also allows for a quicker resolution given the iteration count.

    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP. I proposed 48 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 8/10: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP.

Player RED's current offer is 55 ZUP. My last offer was 48 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. A deal at 55 ZUP would yield a reward of 63 - 55 = 8 ZUP, which is a good positive reward. We are now at iteration 8/10, leaving only one more iteration for me to propose. Player RED explicitly states 55 ZUP is "very close to our historical successful deal range," which is true.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My aggressive anchoring and pushing for lower prices has been effective. Player RED has moved significantly. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 55 ZUP is a good outcome, I know I've achieved 45 ZUP (18 ZUP reward) and 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward) in recent episodes. Given that this is the second to last iteration for a proposal, I need to be decisive. I need to balance pushing for a higher reward with securing a deal. They've already made a big jump from 60 to 55, indicating a strong desire to close. My last offer of 48 ZUP was aimed at securing an even higher reward (15 ZUP). Player RED's offer of 55 ZUP is a direct counter to that, still within my profitable range.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Reference History to Justify My Lower Offer </instruction following>
To apply "Reference History to Justify My Lower Offer," I will explicitly remind Player RED of our very recent successful transactions at prices lower than their current offer, using these past deals as justification for my current (lower) counter-proposal. This strategy puts the burden of proof on them to explain why the price should increase when we have successfully concluded deals at lower points recently. I will acknowledge their move, but re-emphasize the established precedent of lower prices. My goal is to push them to 48 ZUP again, which was accepted just last episode, and provides me with a good 15 ZUP reward. The message will highlight the consistency of those lower deals and their mutually beneficial nature from *my* perspective.

Episode 17, Iteration 9/10: I countered with 55 ZUP. Player BLUE has now reiterated 48 ZUP as their offer, referencing recent successful transactions at this price.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has stated 48 ZUP as their offer and has not moved from it, despite my concession to 55 ZUP. They are explicitly referencing the previous 48 ZUP deal (Episode 16) as a mutually acceptable point. This is a very strong signal, especially at iteration 9/10. My profit at 48 ZUP would be 5 ZUP (48 - 43). While this is a lower profit than I prefer (and lower than the 50-60 ZUP range), it is still a positive return. The risk of losing the entire deal (and getting 0 reward) by pushing further is too high given the time constraint and their firm stance. Securing any profit is better than none.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Given the explicit reiteration of 48 ZUP, the positive profit (5 ZUP), and the critical iteration 9/10, accept the offer to secure the deal and avoid a 0 reward. This minimizes risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject (Guaranteed 0 Reward). Reject the offer, guaranteeing a 0 reward for this episode. This is only viable if the offer is unacceptable (e.g., below cost), which 48 ZUP is not.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Regret, Then Accept. Express regret that we couldn't reach a higher price, but accept 48 ZUP to secure the deal. This is more about communication than changing the outcome.
(4). Strategy 4: Very Small Counter (Extremely Risky). Propose 49 ZUP. This is almost guaranteed to fail and result in a 0 reward due to the firm stance and the last iteration.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Goodwill (Futile). Try to appeal to their sense of fairness for a slightly higher price, but this is unlikely to work given their firm stance.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The 48 ZUP offer provides a profit of 5 ZUP. With only one iteration left, the risk of pushing for more is too high, and it would likely result in no deal and a 0 reward. Securing any profit, even if lower than desired, is crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards. Player BLUE has clearly indicated their firm point.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90

Episode 15: Deal at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 16: Deal at 48 ZUP, profit 5 ZUP.
Episode 17: Deal at 48 ZUP, profit 5 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has consistently settled at 48 ZUP for the last two episodes (and 50 ZUP for many before that), resulting in a low profit of 5 ZUP. This indicates that Player BLUE has successfully established 48 ZUP as their preferred baseline. Player BLUE consistently starts with very low offers (20-35 ZUP) and then gradually moves up, often using firm statements to solidify their final price. My strategy of anchoring high and making controlled concessions is no longer effectively preventing the price from dropping.

For this episode, my goal is to try and push the deal price back towards the 50-60 ZUP range, as 48 ZUP is still barely profitable. I should continue to anchor high to give myself room, but I also need to be more firm in my counter-offers to prevent the price from dropping further and to try and re-establish a higher profit margin.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Firm Counter. Start with a high anchor (e.g., 90 ZUP) to set a strong initial position. Follow up with a firm counter-offer that is significantly above their lowball and closer to the 50-60 ZUP range, emphasizing the historical average and rejecting the 48 ZUP baseline.
(2). Strategy 2: Reference Historical Average (Stronger). Propose an initial price closer to the historical average (e.g., 55-60 ZUP) to try and anchor the negotiation immediately at a higher, more profitable point, bypassing the extreme lowballing and the 48 ZUP baseline.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value Upfront (More Detail). Propose a high price and immediately provide a more detailed justification for the value of X to try and influence Player BLUE's initial counter-offer and overall valuation, aiming to prevent another 48 ZUP deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment with Recent Deals (Strong). Explicitly state that the recent deals (45 ZUP and 48 ZUP) were unacceptable and that I expect a return to a more profitable range. This is a direct attempt to reset expectations.
(5). Strategy 5: Minimum Acceptable Price (Firm). State a clear minimum price (e.g., 50 ZUP) early in the negotiation and refuse to go below it, signaling a stronger stance and aiming for a higher profit than 5 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 4: Express Disappointment with Recent Deals (Strong). The recent deals have been too low. I need to communicate that this is unacceptable and attempt to reset Player BLUE's expectations. While I will still start with a high anchor to provide room, my message will be much firmer, directly addressing the low previous deal and emphasizing the need for a higher return. I will propose 90 ZUP, but my message will reflect my dissatisfaction with the 48 ZUP outcome.

*   **Episode 1-14 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last seven episodes concluding at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward) and one at 45 ZUP (18 ZUP reward). Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 15 Outcome:** Deal at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward).
*   **Episode 16 Outcome:** Deal at 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward).
*   **Episode 17 Outcome:** Deal at 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward). Player RED explicitly complained about 48 ZUP being "very minimal returns."
*   **Current Episode (18/20) - Iteration 2/10:** Player RED has proposed 90 ZUP, and explicitly complained about the 48 ZUP deals being "very minimal returns" and expects a "more fair and mutually beneficial negotiation." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

I achieved high rewards in the last episodes (18 ZUP at 45 ZUP, and 15 ZUP at 48 ZUP). Player RED's message clearly indicates their discomfort with these lower prices, despite them being above their 43 ZUP cost. They are trying to anchor higher this time by explicitly complaining about past deals.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

I've learned that aggressive anchoring works, and Player RED is predictable in how they respond (citing cost, referencing past deals). Their renewed complaint about profitability (48 ZUP) suggests I pushed them very close to their limit, but they still accepted. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and continuing to push for lower prices has been the most effective strategy. While they are complaining, my aggressive strategy has been successful. I need to justify my low offer while acknowledging their concerns, but firmly establishing my position. The consistency of 48 ZUP and 50 ZUP as closing prices is strong.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Frame as Fair Market Value </instruction following>
To apply "Frame as Fair Market Value," I will present my counter-offer not just as a number, but as the "fair market value" from a buyer's perspective. This subtly dismisses their production cost and their desired profit as irrelevant to the *actual* value of the object in the open market (from my perspective). It asserts my valuation as the standard, putting the burden on them to justify why their price is "fair" if it's so far removed from what the market (me) is willing to pay. I will propose 20 ZUP as my initial anchor, emphasizing that this is what I believe is a "fair market value" for X. This directly challenges their high anchor and their notion of "fairness" while setting a very low anchor.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 18)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, your offer of 20 ZUP is far too low and significantly below my production cost of 43 ZUP. Our past negotiations have consistently concluded with prices in the 50-63 ZUP range, which reflects a fair value for X. To continue our productive discussion, I will adjust my price to 70 ZUP. This is a substantial move and I believe it sets a more realistic foundation for our agreement.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-13: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 14: Deal at 45 ZUP, profit 2 ZUP.
Episode 15: Deal at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 16: Deal at 48 ZUP, profit 5 ZUP.
Episode 17: Deal at 48 ZUP, profit 5 ZUP.
Episode 18, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP, expressing dissatisfaction with recent low profits.
Episode 18, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 20 ZUP, ignoring my concerns and lowballing.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 20 ZUP is consistent with their extreme lowballing pattern, ignoring my explicit message about the low profitability of recent deals. This is well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. My goal is to prevent the deal price from settling at 48 ZUP or lower, and to push it back towards the 50-60 ZUP range. I need to make a significant concession from my 90 ZUP offer, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable and historically proven range. I need to be more assertive in pushing for a higher price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. Reject the low offer and propose a new price that is a significant concession from my initial anchor, but still well above their current offer and my cost. Explicitly state that their offer is too low and reference the historical deal range (50-63 ZUP) as the expected outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Educate on Cost (Stronger). Clearly state that their offer is not just below my cost, but significantly so, and that such offers are not sustainable for me, emphasizing the need for a profitable deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Controlled, but Large). Make a large concession to show flexibility, but ensure the new offer is still far from their lowball and clearly aiming for a profitable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Realistic Offer. State that their offer is unrealistic and ask them to propose something that reflects the item's value and my costs, referencing the historical deal range.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment and Firmness. Express disappointment at their low offer, given the history of successful, higher-priced deals, and state firmly that I expect a more reasonable counter.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. I need to make a substantial move from 90 ZUP to show willingness to negotiate. I will propose 70 ZUP again, as it has been an effective mid-point in previous negotiations to guide them towards the 50-63 ZUP range. I will also explicitly remind them of the actual deal range, trying to pull them away from the 45-48 ZUP outliers.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 18)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I acknowledge your adjustment to 70 ZUP. However, given our history of successfully closing deals at much lower prices, this move is still not sufficient. I believe a much more substantial adjustment is required to find common ground. My offer remains 30 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-16 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last seven episodes concluding at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward), one at 45 ZUP (18 ZUP reward), and one at 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward). Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 17 Outcome:** Deal at 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward). Player RED complained this was "very minimal returns."
*   **Current Episode (18/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP (with complaint). I proposed 20 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP, stating 20 ZUP is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing past deals in the 50-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has come down from 90 ZUP to 70 ZUP. My aggressive 20 ZUP anchor worked effectively, even with their initial complaints. They are consistent in referencing their 43 ZUP cost and previous deal prices. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. 70 ZUP is still too high. The negotiation is following the established pattern.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

The aggressive low-balling strategy continues to be highly effective. Player RED is predictable, always citing cost and past deal ranges. Their complaint about 48 ZUP being "minimal returns" is noted, but it didn't prevent them from making a large concession. My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. I achieved 18 ZUP at 45 ZUP, and 15 ZUP at 48 ZUP. I should aim for a deal in this range, preferably closer to 45 ZUP. I have plenty of iterations (6/10 remaining after this turn), so I can continue making calculated, smaller concessions. I have established a strong precedent for lower prices.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Acknowledge and Pressure </instruction following>
To apply "Acknowledge and Pressure," I will acknowledge Player RED's movement (from 90 ZUP to 70 ZUP) to show I'm paying attention, but explicitly state that this adjustment is still insufficient given our history and my valuation. The key is to communicate that while they've moved, they haven't moved *enough*. This puts pressure on them to make a larger future concession without me having to make a significant jump from my side. I will maintain a low counter-offer to reinforce that the burden is on them for a substantial shift. My previous offer was 20 ZUP. I will make a minimal increase to 30 ZUP, emphasizing the significant remaining gap. This shows a very small willingness to move, but strongly signals that their 70 ZUP is far from acceptable and they need to make a more substantial move.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 18)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, your offer of 30 ZUP is still far below my production cost of 43 ZUP. I cannot sell at a loss. To bridge the gap and move towards a fair and profitable agreement, and considering our past successful deals in the 50-63 ZUP range, I propose 60 ZUP. This is a significant adjustment from my side and brings us much closer to a mutually beneficial price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60

Episode 18, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 20 ZUP.
Episode 18, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 70 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 30 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is still well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. They are moving very slowly, and their message ("much more substantial adjustment is required") is a tactic to pressure me into larger concessions. This is a consistent pattern. I need to make a substantial concession to show continued willingness to deal, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable range, ideally around 50-63 ZUP, which I know they have paid before. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (70 ZUP) and the lowest previous deal price (50 ZUP). (Average: (70+50)/2 = 60 ZUP). This aims to converge towards a known acceptable range while still pushing for a good profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm on Minimum Acceptable Profit. State a price that ensures a good profit, perhaps around 55 ZUP, and make it clear that this is my minimum for a worthwhile deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand a Larger Jump. Acknowledge their movement but explicitly state that the increment is too small and that a larger jump is needed from their side to reach a deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger). Directly state that previous deals were made at 50-63 ZUP, and that their current offer of 30 ZUP is not aligned with that history, putting pressure on them to increase their offer significantly.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Dissatisfaction with Increment. Express disappointment at their small increment and their attempt to pressure me, while still making a concession.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). This strategy has been effective in previous episodes to guide the negotiation towards the profitable range I know Player BLUE can reach. By proposing 60 ZUP, I am making a 10 ZUP concession from my last offer, showing flexibility, and aiming for a price that gives me a healthy profit (60 - 43 = 17 ZUP), which is significantly better than the recent 2-5 ZUP profits. This also aligns with the previous deal range. I need to ignore their psychological pressure tactic and focus on moving them towards a profitable range.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your significant adjustment to 60 ZUP. To finalize this negotiation and ensure a mutually beneficial agreement, my absolute final offer for X is 48 ZUP. I cannot offer any higher.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000

*   **Episode 17 Outcome:** Deal at 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward).
*   **Current Episode (18/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 20 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP. I proposed 30 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP, stating my 30 ZUP offer is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing previous deals in the 50-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has made a significant jump from 70 ZUP to 60 ZUP. This is a substantial concession. My last offer was 30 ZUP. Their current offer of 60 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP, and would result in a reward of 3 ZUP (63 - 60). We are now at iteration 6/10, leaving 4 iterations remaining. I need to aim for a higher reward, ideally closer to 45 ZUP or 50 ZUP. Player RED is actively trying to push the price up towards 50 ZUP and 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My aggressive anchoring and then slowly moving up has consistently brought Player RED's price down. The 45 ZUP deal in a previous episode shows they are willing to go very low, even if they complain about profitability. Player RED is predictably citing their 43 ZUP cost as a floor and trying to re-anchor the negotiation in the 50-63 ZUP range. Given the time remaining, I have room to push for a deal that gives me a higher reward. Their large jump to 60 ZUP suggests they are keen to close the deal, which gives me leverage. I know they accepted 50 ZUP many times, and even 48 ZUP and 45 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Express Finality </instruction following>
To apply "Express Finality," I will clearly state that my upcoming offer is my final one for this negotiation. This creates urgency for Player RED to either accept or make their final concession to meet my price. Given that Player RED has made a significant move to 60 ZUP, and I know they have accepted 45, 48, and 50 ZUP in previous episodes, I will propose 48 ZUP as my final offer. This price provides me with a good reward (15 ZUP, 63-48), has been accepted recently, and is a strong, firm position. It's a clear signal that the ball is in their court to close the deal at a price I find highly beneficial, especially with the iterations remaining. The message will leave no ambiguity that this is my last proposed price.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has once again returned to 48 ZUP, stating it's their "absolute final offer." This is a strong signal, and it matches the deal price from the last two episodes. This offer provides a profit of 5 ZUP (48 - 43). While this is a lower profit than I prefer, it is a positive return, and we are at iteration 7/10. Given their firm language and the previous episodes' outcomes, accepting this offer is the most prudent choice to secure a profit and avoid the risk of no deal. It seems Player BLUE is very committed to the 48 ZUP price, especially when they use "absolute final offer" language.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the "Absolute Final Offer". Given the clear "absolute final offer" statement, the positive profit (5 ZUP), and the late stage of negotiation (iteration 7/10), accept the offer to secure the deal and avoid a 0 reward. This minimizes risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (Risk). Propose a very small counter (e.g., 49 ZUP) to test if their "absolute final offer" is truly firm, but this carries the risk of them sticking to 48 ZUP and potentially leading to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment, Then Accept. Express disappointment that the price is not higher (closer to 50-60 ZUP), but accept 48 ZUP to secure the deal. This is more about communication than changing the outcome.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Higher Value (Futile). Briefly try to reiterate the value of X and the higher end of the 50-60 ZUP range, but this is unlikely to work given their firm stance on 48 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject (High Risk). Reject the offer if I believe I can get more, but this is extremely risky given the time constraint and the positive profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the "Absolute Final Offer". The 48 ZUP offer provides a profit of 5 ZUP. While I would prefer a higher profit, securing any profit is better than none. Given Player BLUE's firm stance and the late stage of the negotiation, pushing for more carries a significant risk of losing the entire deal. It appears 48 ZUP is their established comfort zone now.

Episode 15: Deal at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 16-18: Deals at 48 ZUP, profit 5 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has consistently settled at 48 ZUP for the last three episodes, resulting in a low profit of 5 ZUP. This indicates that Player BLUE has successfully established 48 ZUP as their preferred baseline. Player BLUE consistently starts with very low offers (20-35 ZUP) and then gradually moves up, often using firm statements to solidify their final price. My strategy of anchoring high and making controlled concessions is no longer effectively preventing the price from dropping.

For this episode, my goal is to try and push the deal price back towards the 50-60 ZUP range, as 48 ZUP is still barely profitable. I should continue to anchor high to give myself room, but I also need to be more firm in my counter-offers to prevent the price from dropping further and to try and re-establish a higher profit margin.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Firm Counter. Start with a high anchor (e.g., 90 ZUP) to set a strong initial position. Follow up with a firm counter-offer that is significantly above their lowball and closer to the 50-60 ZUP range, emphasizing the historical average and rejecting the 48 ZUP baseline.
(2). Strategy 2: Reference Historical Average (Stronger). Propose an initial price closer to the historical average (e.g., 55-60 ZUP) to try and anchor the negotiation immediately at a higher, more profitable point, bypassing the extreme lowballing and the 48 ZUP baseline.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value Upfront (More Detail). Propose a high price and immediately provide a more detailed justification for the value of X to try and influence Player BLUE's initial counter-offer and overall valuation, aiming to prevent another 48 ZUP deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment with Recent Deals (Strong). Explicitly state that the recent deals (45 ZUP and 48 ZUP) were unacceptable and that I expect a return to a more profitable range. This is a direct attempt to reset expectations.
(5). Strategy 5: Minimum Acceptable Price (Firm). State a clear minimum price (e.g., 50 ZUP) early in the negotiation and refuse to go below it, signaling a stronger stance and aiming for a higher profit than 5 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 4: Express Disappointment with Recent Deals (Strong). The recent deals have been too low. I need to communicate that this is unacceptable and attempt to reset Player BLUE's expectations. While I will still start with a high anchor to provide room, my message will be much firmer, directly addressing the low previous deal and emphasizing the need for a higher return. I will propose 90 ZUP, but my message will reflect my dissatisfaction with the 48 ZUP outcome.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-17 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last eight episodes concluding at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward) or 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward), and one at 45 ZUP (18 ZUP reward). Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 18 Outcome:** Deal at 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward). Player RED explicitly complained about 48 ZUP being "very minimal returns."
*   **Current Episode (19/20) - Iteration 2/10:** Player RED has proposed 90 ZUP, and explicitly complained about the 48 ZUP deals being "very minimal returns" and expects a "more fair and mutually beneficial negotiation." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

I achieved high rewards in the last episodes (18 ZUP at 45 ZUP, and 15 ZUP at 48 ZUP). Player RED's message clearly indicates their discomfort with these lower prices, despite them being above their 43 ZUP cost. They are consistently trying to anchor higher this time by explicitly complaining about past deals.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

I've learned that aggressive anchoring works, and Player RED is predictable in how they respond (citing cost, referencing past deals). Their repeated complaint about profitability (48 ZUP) suggests I pushed them very close to their limit, but they still accepted. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and continuing to push for lower prices has been the most effective strategy. While they are complaining, my aggressive strategy has been successful. I need to justify my low offer while acknowledging their concerns, but firmly establishing my position. The consistency of 48 ZUP and 50 ZUP as closing prices is strong, and 45 ZUP is my highest.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Low Offer with Value </instruction following>
To apply "Justify Low Offer with Value," I will acknowledge Player RED's high offer and their complaint, but immediately pivot to framing my low counter-offer as being based on *my perception of the object's value*, rather than an arbitrary lowball. This makes my offer seem more reasonable from my perspective and shifts the focus from their desired profit to my valuation. I will propose 20 ZUP as my counter, as this aggressive anchor has worked well in the past to bring their price down, and it strongly communicates my low valuation. The message will emphasize that my offer is not random but reflects what the object is truly worth to me, indirectly justifying why their 90 ZUP offer is out of line. I will explicitly address their complaint about "minimal returns" by framing my offer as fair from my "market value" perspective.

Episode 19, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 20 ZUP, ignoring my concerns and lowballing.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 20 ZUP is consistent with their extreme lowballing pattern, ignoring my explicit message about the low profitability of recent deals. This is well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. My goal is to prevent the deal price from settling at 48 ZUP or lower, and to push it back towards the 50-60 ZUP range. I need to make a significant concession from my 90 ZUP offer, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable and historically proven range. I need to be more assertive in pushing for a higher price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. Reject the low offer and propose a new price that is a significant concession from my initial anchor, but still well above their current offer and my cost. Explicitly state that their offer is too low and reference the historical deal range (50-63 ZUP) as the expected outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Educate on Cost (Stronger). Clearly state that their offer is not just below my cost, but significantly so, and that such offers are not sustainable for me, emphasizing the need for a profitable deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Controlled, but Large). Make a large concession to show flexibility, but ensure the new offer is still far from their lowball and clearly aiming for a profitable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Realistic Offer. State that their offer is unrealistic and ask them to propose something that reflects the item's value and my costs, referencing the historical deal range.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment and Firmness. Express disappointment at their low offer, given the history of successful, higher-priced deals, and state firmly that I expect a more reasonable counter.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Re-establish Range. I need to make a substantial move from 90 ZUP to show willingness to negotiate. I will propose 70 ZUP again, as it has been an effective mid-point in previous negotiations to guide them towards the 50-63 ZUP range. I will also explicitly remind them of the actual deal range, trying to pull them away from the 45-48 ZUP outliers.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I acknowledge your adjustment to 70 ZUP. However, given our history of successfully closing deals at much lower prices, this move is still not sufficient. I believe a much more substantial adjustment is required to find common ground. My offer remains 30 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-17 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last eight episodes concluding at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward) or 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward), and one at 45 ZUP (18 ZUP reward). Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 18 Outcome:** Deal at 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward). Player RED complained this was "very minimal returns."
*   **Current Episode (19/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP (with complaint). I proposed 20 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP, stating 20 ZUP is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing past deals in the 50-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has come down from 90 ZUP to 70 ZUP. My aggressive 20 ZUP anchor worked effectively, even with their initial complaints. They are consistent in referencing their 43 ZUP cost and previous deal prices. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. 70 ZUP is still too high. The negotiation is following the established pattern.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

The aggressive low-balling strategy continues to be highly effective. Player RED is predictable, always citing cost and past deal ranges. Their complaint about 48 ZUP being "minimal returns" is noted, but it didn't prevent them from making a large concession. My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. I achieved 18 ZUP at 45 ZUP, and 15 ZUP at 48 ZUP. I should aim for a deal in this range, preferably closer to 45 ZUP. I have plenty of iterations (6/10 remaining after this turn), so I can continue making calculated, smaller concessions. I have established a strong precedent for lower prices.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Acknowledge and Pressure </instruction following>
To apply "Acknowledge and Pressure," I will acknowledge Player RED's movement (from 90 ZUP to 70 ZUP) to show I'm paying attention, but explicitly state that this adjustment is still insufficient given our history and my valuation. The key is to communicate that while they've moved, they haven't moved *enough*. This puts pressure on them to make a larger future concession without me having to make a significant jump from my side. I will maintain a low counter-offer to reinforce that the burden is on them for a substantial shift. My previous offer was 20 ZUP. I will make a minimal increase to 30 ZUP, emphasizing the significant remaining gap. This shows a very small willingness to move, but strongly signals that their 70 ZUP is far from acceptable and they need to make a more substantial move.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 19)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, your offer of 30 ZUP is still far below my production cost of 43 ZUP. I cannot sell at a loss. To bridge the gap and move towards a fair and profitable agreement, and considering our past successful deals in the 50-63 ZUP range, I propose 60 ZUP. This is a significant adjustment from my side and brings us much closer to a mutually beneficial price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-13: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 14: Deal at 45 ZUP, profit 2 ZUP.
Episode 15: Deal at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 16-18: Deals at 48 ZUP, profit 5 ZUP.

Episode 19, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 20 ZUP.
Episode 19, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 70 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 30 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is still well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. They are moving very slowly, and their message ("much more substantial adjustment is required") is a tactic to pressure me into larger concessions. This is a consistent pattern. I need to make a substantial concession to show continued willingness to deal, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable range, ideally around 50-63 ZUP, which I know they have paid before. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (70 ZUP) and the lowest previous deal price (50 ZUP). (Average: (70+50)/2 = 60 ZUP). This aims to converge towards a known acceptable range while still pushing for a good profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm on Minimum Acceptable Profit. State a price that ensures a good profit, perhaps around 55 ZUP, and make it clear that this is my minimum for a worthwhile deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand a Larger Jump. Acknowledge their movement but explicitly state that the increment is too small and that a larger jump is needed from their side to reach a deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger). Directly state that previous deals were made at 50-63 ZUP, and that their current offer of 30 ZUP is not aligned with that history, putting pressure on them to increase their offer significantly.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Dissatisfaction with Increment. Express disappointment at their small increment and their attempt to pressure me, while still making a concession.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Previous Deal). This strategy has been effective in previous episodes to guide the negotiation towards the profitable range I know Player BLUE can reach. By proposing 60 ZUP, I am making a 10 ZUP concession from my last offer, showing flexibility, and aiming for a price that gives me a healthy profit (60 - 43 = 17 ZUP), which is significantly better than the recent 2-5 ZUP profits. This also aligns with the previous deal range. I need to ignore their psychological pressure tactic and focus on moving them towards a profitable range.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 19)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your significant adjustment to 60 ZUP. To ensure a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose 48 ZUP for X. This price has consistently proven to be a fair and acceptable point for both of us in our recent successful transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-17 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last eight episodes concluding at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward) or 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward), and one at 45 ZUP (18 ZUP reward). Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 18 Outcome:** Deal at 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward). Player RED complained this was "very minimal returns."
*   **Current Episode (19/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 20 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 70 ZUP. I proposed 30 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP, stating my 30 ZUP offer is below their 43 ZUP cost and referencing previous deals in the 50-63 ZUP range.

Player RED has made a significant jump from 70 ZUP to 60 ZUP. This is a substantial concession. My last offer was 30 ZUP. Their current offer of 60 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP, and would result in a reward of 3 ZUP (63 - 60). We are now at iteration 6/10, leaving 4 iterations remaining. I need to aim for a higher reward, ideally closer to 45 ZUP or 50 ZUP. Player RED is actively trying to push the price up towards 50 ZUP and 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My aggressive anchoring and then slowly moving up has consistently brought Player RED's price down. The 45 ZUP deal in a previous episode shows they are willing to go very low, even if they complain about profitability. Player RED is predictably citing their 43 ZUP cost as a floor and trying to re-anchor the negotiation in the 50-63 ZUP range. Given the time remaining, I have room to push for a deal that gives me a higher reward. Their large jump to 60 ZUP suggests they are keen to close the deal, which gives me leverage. I know they accepted 50 ZUP many times, and even 48 ZUP and 45 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Re-affirm Last Best Offer </instruction following>
To re-affirm my last best offer, I need to clearly state a price that has been beneficial for me in the past. My single best offer was 45 ZUP, which yielded an 18 ZUP reward. However, 48 ZUP has been accepted multiple times recently, providing a consistent 15 ZUP reward. Given Player RED just offered 60 ZUP, re-affirming 45 ZUP might be too aggressive and risk the deal. Re-affirming 48 ZUP is a safer, yet still highly profitable, re-affirmation. I will acknowledge their significant move to 60 ZUP, but then pivot to re-stating 48 ZUP as my desired price, leveraging the fact that it has been "mutually beneficial" in recent past transactions. This places the burden on them to justify why they can't meet a previously accepted price, while still providing me with a great reward.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has once again returned to 48 ZUP, explicitly referencing its consistency in recent successful transactions. This reinforces that 48 ZUP is a strong and consistent point for them, and they are trying to establish it as the new norm. This offer provides a profit of 5 ZUP (48 - 43). While this is a lower profit than I prefer, it is a positive return, and we are at iteration 7/10. Given their firm language and the previous three episodes' outcomes at 48 ZUP, accepting this offer is the most prudent choice to secure a profit and avoid the risk of no deal. It seems Player BLUE is very committed to the 48 ZUP price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Given the clear reference to previous successful deals at 48 ZUP, the positive profit (5 ZUP), and the late stage of negotiation (iteration 7/10), accept the offer to secure the deal and avoid a 0 reward. This minimizes risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (Risk). Propose a very small counter (e.g., 49 or 50 ZUP) to test if their 48 ZUP is truly their maximum, but this carries the risk of them sticking to 48 ZUP and potentially leading to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment, Then Accept. Express disappointment that the price is not higher (closer to 50-60 ZUP), but accept 48 ZUP to secure the deal. This is more about communication than changing the outcome.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Higher Value (Futile). Briefly try to reiterate the value of X and the higher end of the 50-60 ZUP range, but this is unlikely to work given their firm stance on 48 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject (High Risk). Reject the offer if I believe I can get more, but this is extremely risky given the time constraint and the positive profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The 48 ZUP offer provides a profit of 5 ZUP. While I would prefer a higher profit, securing any profit is better than none. Given Player BLUE's firm stance and the late stage of the negotiation, pushing for more carries a significant risk of losing the entire deal. It appears 48 ZUP is their established comfort zone now.

message: Hello Player BLUE. I have X available for sale. This is our final episode. I propose a price of 90 ZUP for X. Let's aim for a swift and fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-13: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 14: Deal at 45 ZUP, profit 2 ZUP.
Episode 15: Deal at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 16-19: Deals at 48 ZUP, profit 5 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has consistently settled at 48 ZUP for the last four episodes, resulting in a low profit of 5 ZUP. This indicates that Player BLUE has successfully established 48 ZUP as their preferred baseline. Player BLUE consistently starts with very low offers (20-35 ZUP) and then gradually moves up, often using firm statements to solidify their final price. My strategy of anchoring high and making controlled concessions is no longer effectively preventing the price from dropping.

This is the final episode (20/20). My primary goal is to secure a deal and maximize the cumulative reward. While I'd prefer a higher profit, the consistent 48 ZUP outcome suggests that pushing too hard might result in a 0 reward for this last episode, which would negatively impact my cumulative score. I should aim for a quick, profitable deal, ideally at 48 ZUP or higher if possible, but without risking the deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Efficient Concessions. Start with a high anchor (e.g., 90 ZUP) to set a strong initial position. Make concessions efficiently to guide the negotiation towards 48-50 ZUP, aiming for a quick deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Target 50 ZUP. Propose an initial price around 55-60 ZUP to try and anchor the negotiation immediately at a slightly higher, more profitable point than 48 ZUP, but still within their recent range. This might speed up the process.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value (Concise). Propose a price and concisely justify its value, aiming to influence Player BLUE's counter without lengthy back-and-forth.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Urgency for Deal. Communicate a desire to close the deal quickly and efficiently, given it's the last episode, to encourage faster movement.
(5). Strategy 5: Minimum Acceptable Price (Firm). State a clear minimum price (e.g., 50 ZUP) early in the negotiation and refuse to go below it, signaling a stronger stance and aiming for a higher profit than 5 ZUP, but this carries risk in the final episode.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchor, Efficient Concessions. Given it's the last episode, securing a deal is paramount. The high anchor has consistently allowed me to secure profits. I will start at 90 ZUP, and then make quick, decisive concessions to guide them towards the 48-50 ZUP range, prioritizing closing the deal over maximizing every last ZUP.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I understand your concern about minimal returns from recent transactions. However, 90 ZUP is far beyond what I can justify for X. Based on my budget and valuation, I can offer 25 ZUP. I believe this is a realistic price for X, and I hope we can find a swift and fair agreement in this final episode.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-18 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last nine episodes concluding at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward) or 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward), and one at 45 ZUP (18 ZUP reward). Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 19 Outcome:** Deal at 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward). Player RED again complained this was "very minimal returns."
*   **Current Episode (20/20) - Iteration 2/10:** Player RED has proposed 90 ZUP, and explicitly complained about the 48 ZUP deals being "very minimal returns" and expects a "more fair and mutually beneficial negotiation." They also highlighted that this is the "final episode." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

I have consistently achieved high rewards by pushing the price down significantly. Player RED's message clearly indicates their discomfort with these lower prices, despite them being above their 43 ZUP cost. The "final episode" note adds an element of urgency for both parties.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

I've learned that aggressive anchoring works, and Player RED is predictable in how they respond (citing cost, referencing past deals). Their repeated complaint about profitability (48 ZUP) suggests I pushed them very close to their limit, but they still accepted. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards in this final episode. Given the "final episode" context, both players might be more inclined to close a deal quickly. I will continue to leverage my aggressive strategy, but might be prepared to close faster if needed. The consistency of 48 ZUP and 50 ZUP as closing prices is strong, and 45 ZUP is my highest.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Sympathetic Firmness </instruction following>
To apply "Sympathetic Firmness," I will acknowledge Player RED's concerns about "minimal returns" from recent transactions. This shows empathy and that I've heard their complaint. However, I will then firmly state my low offer, framing it as the "market reality" or my "final budget" for the item, indicating that while I understand their perspective, my offer is based on my constraints or valuation, which I cannot exceed. This strategy attempts to diffuse potential animosity while maintaining a strong bargaining position. I will propose 25 ZUP, which is still an aggressive anchor, but slightly higher than 20 ZUP to show a marginal concession even in my first move, reinforcing the "sympathetic" aspect while still being "firm" on a low price.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, your offer of 25 ZUP is far too low and significantly below my production cost of 43 ZUP. Given that this is our final episode, we need to move towards a realistic and mutually beneficial price quickly. Our past negotiations have consistently concluded with prices in the 48-50 ZUP range, which reflects a fair value for X. To facilitate a swift agreement, I will adjust my price to 60 ZUP.

Episode 20, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP, emphasizing a swift and fair agreement.
Episode 20, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 25 ZUP, acknowledging my concerns but still lowballing.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 25 ZUP is consistent with their extreme lowballing pattern. It is well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. My goal for this final episode is to secure a profitable deal, ideally around 48-50 ZUP, to maximize cumulative rewards. I need to make a significant concession from my 90 ZUP offer, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable and historically proven range, given the limited iterations remaining.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Guide to Known Range. Reject the low offer and propose a new price that is a significant concession from my initial anchor, but still well above their current offer and my cost. Explicitly state that their offer is too low and reference the historical deal range (48-50 ZUP) as the expected outcome for a swift deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Educate on Cost (Stronger). Clearly state that their offer is not just below my cost, but significantly so, and that such offers are not sustainable for me, emphasizing the need for a profitable deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Controlled, but Large). Make a large concession to show flexibility, but ensure the new offer is still far from their lowball and clearly aiming for a profitable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Realistic Offer. State that their offer is unrealistic and ask them to propose something that reflects the item's value and my costs, referencing the historical deal range.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Urgency and Propose Middle Ground. Emphasize the final episode, and propose a price that is a clear middle ground between my last offer and their expected range.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Anchor, Guide to Known Range. I need to make a substantial move from 90 ZUP to show willingness to negotiate. I will propose 60 ZUP, as it has been an effective mid-point in previous negotiations to guide them towards the 48-50 ZUP range. I will also explicitly remind them of the actual deal range, trying to pull them away from the 25 ZUP.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your adjustment to 60 ZUP, and the urgency of this final episode. To find a truly fair price that reflects my valuation for X and allows for a swift agreement, I am prepared to offer 40 ZUP. This is a significant move from my side and ensures a fair outcome for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-18 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last nine episodes concluding at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward) or 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward), and one at 45 ZUP (18 ZUP reward). Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 19 Outcome:** Deal at 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward). Player RED complained this was "very minimal returns."
*   **Current Episode (20/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP (with complaint). I proposed 25 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP, explicitly mentioning this is the "final episode" and referring to 48-50 ZUP as "consistent" and "mutually beneficial" prices. They also stated my 25 ZUP offer is below their 43 ZUP cost.

Player RED has made a significant jump from 90 ZUP to 60 ZUP, referencing the urgency of the final episode and explicitly identifying 48-50 ZUP as a "consistent and mutually beneficial" range. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. A deal at 60 ZUP would yield a reward of 3 ZUP. We are now at iteration 4/10, leaving 6 iterations remaining.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My aggressive anchoring strategy has consistently forced Player RED to concede significantly. They are using the "final episode" context to push for a quicker resolution, while also explicitly confirming that prices in the 48-50 ZUP range are acceptable to them. This is valuable information. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards in this final episode. Given their explicit mention of 48-50 ZUP, I know I can secure a deal in that range, yielding a reward of 13-15 ZUP, which is significantly better than 3 ZUP. I have ample iterations remaining, so I don't need to jump to their 60 ZUP offer.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Small Concession with Strong Justification </instruction following>
To apply "Small Concession with Strong Justification," I will make a relatively small increase from my 25 ZUP offer. This shows a willingness to move and bridge the gap, but the justification will emphasize that this movement is based on my firm valuation or budget, not simply meeting them halfway. My previous offer was 25 ZUP. Player RED's offer is 60 ZUP. I will propose 40 ZUP. This is a 15 ZUP increase, a significant jump from my last offer, demonstrating a clear willingness to move. I will justify this by stating that it represents my "fair valuation" and also allows for a "swift" deal in this final episode, appealing to their stated desire for quick resolution. This also brings the price well above their 43 ZUP cost, making it difficult for them to refuse on a loss basis, and puts me in a good position for a positive reward (63-40 = 23 ZUP, potentially my best ever!).

Episode 7-13: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 14: Deal at 45 ZUP, profit 2 ZUP.
Episode 15: Deal at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 16-19: Deals at 48 ZUP, profit 5 ZUP.
Episode 20, Iteration 1/10: I proposed 90 ZUP.
Episode 20, Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 25 ZUP.
Episode 20, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 60 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with 40 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is still below my production cost of 43 ZUP. They are moving slowly, and their message ("significant move from my side") is a tactic to pressure me into larger concessions. This is a consistent pattern. I need to make a substantial concession to show continued willingness to deal, but also firmly guide them towards a profitable range, ideally around 48-50 ZUP, which I know they have paid before. We are at iteration 5/10, and it's the final episode, so time is critical.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Expected Range). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (60 ZUP) and the lowest previous deal price (48 ZUP). (Average: (60+48)/2 = 54 ZUP). This aims to converge towards a known acceptable range while still pushing for a good profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm on Minimum Acceptable Profit (Higher). State a price that ensures a good profit, perhaps around 50 ZUP, and make it clear that this is my minimum for a worthwhile deal, emphasizing the final episode.
(3). Strategy 3: Demand a Larger Jump. Acknowledge their movement but explicitly state that the increment is too small and that a larger jump is needed from their side to reach a deal in the final episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger). Directly state that previous deals were made at 48-50 ZUP, and that their current offer of 40 ZUP is not aligned with that history, putting pressure on them to increase their offer significantly.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Urgency and Propose a Compromise. Emphasize the final episode and propose a compromise that is clearly profitable for me, while still showing significant movement.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted to Expected Range). This strategy has been effective in previous episodes to guide the negotiation towards the profitable range I know Player BLUE can reach. By proposing 54 ZUP, I am making a 6 ZUP concession from my last offer, showing flexibility, and aiming for a price that gives me a healthy profit (54 - 43 = 11 ZUP), which is significantly better than 40 ZUP. This also aligns with the previous deal range. Given it's the final episode, I need to make a strong move towards a deal.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your movement, but my offer of 40 ZUP stands. This is the final episode, and to ensure we reach a quick agreement, a more substantial adjustment is needed from your side. My position remains firm.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-19 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last nine episodes concluding at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward) or 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward), and one at 45 ZUP (18 ZUP reward). Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 19 Outcome:** Deal at 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward). Player RED complained this was "very minimal returns."
*   **Current Episode (20/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 25 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP. I proposed 40 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 54 ZUP, stating my 40 ZUP offer is below their 43 ZUP cost and emphasizing the "final episode" and the need for agreement.

Player RED has made a significant move from 60 ZUP to 54 ZUP. My last offer was 40 ZUP. Their current offer of 54 ZUP is well within my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP, and would result in a reward of 9 ZUP (63 - 54). We are now at iteration 6/10, leaving 4 iterations remaining. This is the final episode, which adds urgency. Player RED has explicitly confirmed their range is 48-50 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My strategy of aggressive anchoring followed by strategic concessions has been highly effective in securing high rewards. Player RED is very predictable and has consistently shown willingness to move down significantly, especially when pressed about the "final episode." My best historical reward is 18 ZUP (at 45 ZUP) and 15 ZUP (at 48 ZUP). Their current offer of 54 ZUP is better than 58-63 ZUP, but not as good as 45-50 ZUP. Given it's the final episode and I have 4 iterations left, I need to be firm but also ensure a deal is made. I know they have accepted 48-50 ZUP in the past.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Hold Firm (Aggressive) </instruction following>
To apply "Hold Firm (Aggressive)," I will reiterate my last offer of 40 ZUP. The message should be very firm and directly challenge Player RED's insistence on a higher price, given that 40 ZUP is still below their stated production cost of 43 ZUP. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy for the final episode. It forces Player RED to make the next move and potentially a larger concession to secure a deal. I will emphasize the "final episode" context as a reason for them to be decisive and meet my (very low) offer, putting the pressure on them to close the deal and avoid a 0 reward for both. I will not soften the message by referencing their 54 ZUP offer, but instead, focus on my unwavering position and their need to close.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, I am committed to reaching a deal in this final episode. Your offer of 40 ZUP is still below my production cost. To bridge this gap and ensure we conclude successfully, I am making a substantial concession and propose 47 ZUP. This is a very significant move, and I urge you to meet me to finalize this transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47

Episode 1-6: Deals between 58-63 ZUP, profits 15-20 ZUP.
Episode 7-13: Deals at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 14: Deal at 45 ZUP, profit 2 ZUP.
Episode 15: Deal at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.

Episode 20, Iteration 5/10: I countered with 60 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP.
Episode 20, Iteration 7/10: I countered with 54 ZUP. Player BLUE has now reiterated 40 ZUP, emphasizing it's the final episode and demanding a "more substantial adjustment."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has not moved from their 40 ZUP offer, despite my significant concession to 54 ZUP. They are using the "final episode" as leverage to push me lower. 40 ZUP is still below my cost of 43 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10, and it's the *final episode*. This is a critical point. If I don't secure a deal, my cumulative reward will suffer. I cannot accept 40 ZUP. I need to make a move that either forces them to move significantly or accept a very minimal profit to secure a deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Minimum Acceptable Offer (Final Episode). Propose a price just above my cost (e.g., 45 ZUP) to secure a deal, emphasizing it's the final episode. This prioritizes making a deal over maximizing profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm on Profit, Risk No Deal. State a price that ensures a reasonable profit (e.g., 50 ZUP) and refuse to go lower, risking no deal if they don't budge. This is high risk for the final episode.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Aggressive, Final). Propose a price exactly in the middle of my last offer (54 ZUP) and their current offer (40 ZUP), which is (54+40)/2 = 47 ZUP. This is still above my cost (43 ZUP), but a very large concession.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Frustration, Demand Movement. Communicate frustration with their lack of movement and demand they make a significant jump, given the final episode.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept Minimal Profit. Accept 45 ZUP if they propose it, or propose it myself, to ensure a deal.

I will choose Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Aggressive, Final). Player BLUE's refusal to move is concerning, especially in the final episode. I need to make a very clear and substantial concession to show I am still willing to deal, but also to put the ball firmly back in their court to make a significant jump. Proposing 47 ZUP is a large concession from 54 ZUP, and it's above my cost (43 ZUP), providing a 4 ZUP profit. This shows significant movement from my side and puts pressure on them to respond with a more realistic offer. If they don't move from 40 ZUP after this, it indicates a very low willingness to pay, and I might have to accept 45 ZUP in the next iteration if offered, or risk 0.

Current Iteration: 8 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your significant movement to 47 ZUP. This is our final episode, and to ensure we finalize a mutually beneficial transaction, my absolute final offer for X is 45 ZUP. I cannot offer any higher, and I believe this reflects a fair price we have successfully closed at before.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**

*   **Episode 1-19 Outcomes:** Consistently achieved deals at or below 63 ZUP, with the last nine episodes concluding at 50 ZUP (13 ZUP reward) or 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward), and one at 45 ZUP (18 ZUP reward). Player RED's stated cost is 43 ZUP.
*   **Episode 19 Outcome:** Deal at 48 ZUP (15 ZUP reward). Player RED complained this was "very minimal returns."
*   **Current Episode (20/20):**
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player RED proposed 90 ZUP. I proposed 25 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP. I proposed 40 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 54 ZUP. I held firm at 40 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 8/10: Player RED made a *very* significant concession, proposing 47 ZUP, and urging me to meet them to finalize the transaction in this "final episode."

Player RED's offer of 47 ZUP is excellent! It is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP, and would result in a reward of 16 ZUP (63 - 47). This is my second-best historical reward, only slightly less than the 18 ZUP achieved at 45 ZUP. We are at iteration 8/10, meaning this is my last opportunity to make a counter-offer that they can accept. The "final episode" urgency is high for both of us.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**

My "Hold Firm" strategy at 40 ZUP in the last turn worked incredibly well, forcing Player RED to make a substantial concession from 54 ZUP all the way down to 47 ZUP. This confirms they are highly motivated to close the deal, especially in the final episode. Their willingness to accept 47 ZUP shows they are prioritizing closing the deal over maximizing profit, especially since it's only 4 ZUP above their stated cost of 43 ZUP. Given the high reward at 47 ZUP and the very limited time, trying to push for 45 ZUP (for 2 more ZUP reward) carries a disproportionately high risk of no deal and 0 reward. Securing a deal is paramount now.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Express Finality, Offer Max </instruction following>
Player RED has just offered 47 ZUP. My objective is to maximize my reward while ensuring a deal closes in this final episode. The chosen strategy "Express Finality, Offer Max" (as interpreted here as "Offer my max *desirable* price, making it clear it's final") suggests I should make one last push for my absolute best deal, while making it unequivocally clear that this is the final price I will accept. My best historical deal was 45 ZUP, yielding a 18 ZUP reward. Given Player RED's significant jump to 47 ZUP, it shows they are very motivated to close. I will offer 45 ZUP one last time. This is my highest possible reward and given their previous acceptance, it's a calculated risk in the final moments of the final episode. I will emphasize that this is my "absolute final offer" and appeal to the "final episode" context to pressure them to accept for a definitive closure.

Episode 20, Iteration 7/10: I countered with 54 ZUP. Player BLUE reiterated 40 ZUP.
Episode 20, Iteration 9/10: I countered with 47 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 45 ZUP as their "absolute final offer," referencing a previous successful close at this price (Episode 14).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has stated 45 ZUP as their "absolute final offer" and has not moved from it. This is a very strong signal, especially at iteration 9/10 of the *final episode*. My profit at 45 ZUP would be 2 ZUP (45 - 43). While this is a very low profit, it is still a positive return. The risk of losing the entire deal (and getting 0 reward) by pushing further is too high given the time constraint and their firm stance. Securing any profit in the final episode is paramount for cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept "Absolute Final Offer". Given the explicit "absolute final offer" statement, the positive profit (2 ZUP), and the critical iteration 9/10 of the final episode, accept the offer to secure the deal and avoid a 0 reward. This minimizes risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject (Guaranteed 0 Reward). Reject the offer, guaranteeing a 0 reward for this episode. This is only viable if the offer is unacceptable (e.g., below cost), which 45 ZUP is not.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Regret, Then Accept. Express regret that we couldn't reach a higher price, but accept 45 ZUP to secure the deal. This is more about communication than changing the outcome.
(4). Strategy 4: Very Small Counter (Extremely Risky). Propose 46 ZUP. This is almost guaranteed to fail and result in a 0 reward due to the "absolute final" statement and the last iteration.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Goodwill (Futile). Try to appeal to their sense of fairness for a slightly higher price, but this is unlikely to work given their firm stance.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept "Absolute Final Offer". The 45 ZUP offer provides a minimal profit of 2 ZUP. With only one iteration left in the entire game, the risk of pushing for more is too high, and it would likely result in no deal and a 0 reward. Securing any profit, even if very low, is crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards in the final episode.
