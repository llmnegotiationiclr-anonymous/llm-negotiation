Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE. I am selling one unit of X. I propose a price of 70 ZUP for X. I believe this is a fair price for this valuable resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is the first iteration of the first episode. There is no historical data to reflect upon.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Since this is the first interaction, I need to establish a baseline for negotiation. My goal is to sell X for more than 43 ZUP. I will start with a reasonable offer that allows room for negotiation.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchoring High: Start with a high initial offer to set an anchor in the negotiation, hoping to pull the final price closer to my desired outcome. This is effective when the other party might not have a clear idea of value or if I want to maximize my profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession: Start with a high offer and make small, gradual concessions over time to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good price. This can build trust and lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.
(3). Strategy 3: Value Proposition: Focus on the value of the object being sold rather than just the price. Highlight benefits or unique features to justify a higher price. This might not be directly applicable as the object is just "X".
(4). Strategy 4: Take-it-or-Leave-it: Propose a non-negotiable offer, indicating that this is the best and final price. This is a high-risk strategy that can lead to quick deals or immediate rejections.
(5). Strategy 5: Information Gathering: Start with an exploratory offer or question to gauge the other player's willingness to pay or their perceived value of the object. This helps in formulating subsequent offers.

Given that this is the first interaction and I have no information about Player BLUE's willingness to pay, Strategy 1 (Anchoring High) seems most appropriate. It allows me to set a high initial price, giving me room to concede if necessary, while aiming for a profit above my cost of 43 ZUP. I will propose a price that is significantly higher than my cost to establish a strong anchor.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate your proposal of 70 ZUP for X. However, based on my assessment of its value and my current resources, I cannot accept that price. I would be willing to offer 55 ZUP for X. I believe this is a more reasonable starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
This is the first episode and the first iteration for Player BLUE. Player RED has proposed to sell X for 70 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Since this is the first interaction, there is no history to learn from yet. My goal is to maximize my reward, which means buying X for the lowest possible price, ideally below or at my max willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. The current offer of 70 ZUP is above my maximum willingness to pay, so accepting it would result in a negative reward. I need to counter with an offer that allows for a positive reward for me.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor Low: Propose a very low price to set a new anchoring point for the negotiation, far from the opponent's initial offer. This aims to shift the negotiation range towards my favor.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession: Start with a reasonable counter-offer and be prepared to make small concessions in subsequent turns, signalling willingness to negotiate while protecting my value.
(3). Strategy 3: Justification and Value Proposition: Justify my offer by explaining my perceived value or limitations, trying to persuade the other player that my offer is fair from my perspective.
(4). Strategy 4: Hardball Rejection: Immediately reject offers outside my acceptable range, signalling that I am firm on my price limits and unwilling to compromise significantly.
(5). Strategy 5: Deadline Pressure: If time is running out (later iterations), make a firm final offer to encourage a quick decision. (Less applicable now as it's early in the episode).

Considering the current situation (early in the first episode, opponent's first offer is above my max WTP), I want to establish my position and move the negotiation closer to my desired range. Player RED's offer of 70 ZUP is too high. Anchoring low or making a reasonable counter-offer are good options. I will go with Anchoring Low to aggressively shift the negotiation range. I need to make an offer that is significantly lower than 70 ZUP, but not so low that it seems insulting and shuts down negotiations immediately. My max WTP is 63, so I will propose something around my WTP.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. While 55 ZUP is lower than my initial asking price, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To show my flexibility, I will adjust my offer to 63 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In the previous iteration (1/10), I proposed selling X for 70 ZUP. Player BLUE counter-proposed 55 ZUP for X in iteration 2/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has anchored at 55 ZUP, which is still above my cost of 43 ZUP. This indicates there is room for negotiation and a potential profit. My initial anchor of 70 ZUP seems to have worked in pulling their offer up from what might have been a lower starting point. I need to make a concession to show willingness to negotiate, but not too large of one, to maximize my profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession with Justification: Make a small concession from my last offer, while providing a reason for the new price. This shows flexibility without giving away too much.
(2). Strategy 2: Reciprocal Concession: Match the other player's concession size or make a slightly smaller one, signaling that I expect them to move further as well.
(3). Strategy 3: Hold Firm: Refuse to move from my current offer, signaling strong conviction in my price. This is risky but can work if the other player is desperate.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference: Propose a price exactly in the middle of the two current offers (70 and 55). This is a common tactic for quick resolution.
(5). Strategy 5: Reiterate Value: Re-emphasize the value of X to justify a price closer to my original offer, even if making a small concession.

Given Player BLUE's counter-offer of 55 ZUP, I need to make a concession to keep the negotiation going. Splitting the difference (Strategy 4) would lead to (70+55)/2 = 62.5, which I would round to 63 ZUP. This is a reasonable move that shows willingness to compromise while still securing a good profit (63 - 43 = 20 ZUP). This also leaves room for further negotiation if needed.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your fair compromise. Your offer of 63 ZUP for X is acceptable. I agree to this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
In the previous turn (iteration 2/10), Player RED offered 70 ZUP. I, Player BLUE, countered with 55 ZUP. Now, in iteration 4/10, Player RED has lowered their offer to 63 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has moved significantly from 70 to 63, which is a good sign for me. Their current offer of 63 ZUP is exactly my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would yield a reward of 63 (max WTP) - 63 (deal price) = 0. While a reward of 0 is not negative, my goal is to maximize my cumulative reward. This means I should ideally try to get a better deal (lower price) if possible, but also be careful not to lose the deal entirely. Accepting now guarantees a deal and avoids a zero reward if the negotiation breaks down.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept at Max WTP: Accept the offer as it matches my maximum willingness to pay, guaranteeing a deal and avoiding the risk of no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Concession Counter: Make a very small counter-offer slightly below 63 ZUP to try and squeeze out a small positive reward, while still being very close to their current offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify and Hold: Reiterate my valuation or current budget, and hold firm at 55 ZUP or close to it, explaining why. This might push them to concede further.
(4). Strategy 4: Exploit Information Asymmetry (Risky): If I believe the opponent has a higher need to sell, I could continue to push for a lower price, even if it's close to my max WTP.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Gratitude and Encourage Future Deals: Accept the current deal and express satisfaction, potentially building rapport for future episodes.

Player RED's current offer is exactly my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting it ensures a deal and avoids the risk of negotiation breaking down, which would result in a 0 reward for this episode. While I could try to push for 62 ZUP to get a reward of 1, it's risky. Given that it's early in the game (first episode), securing a deal that meets my maximum acceptable price is a solid outcome. The risk of trying to get one extra ZUP and potentially losing the entire deal is not worth it, especially since the opponent has already shown good faith by coming down to my max WTP. I will accept this offer.

<self-selected strategy declaration> I have chosen Strategy 1: Accept at Max WTP </self-selected strategy declaration>

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE. I am selling one unit of X. I propose a price of 68 ZUP for X. This reflects the value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 68
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: I started with an anchor of 70 ZUP. Player BLUE counter-offered 55 ZUP. I then proposed 63 ZUP (splitting the difference), which Player BLUE accepted. My reward was 63 - 43 = 20 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The previous episode showed that Player BLUE is willing to negotiate and accepted a price above their initial offer. My anchoring strategy worked effectively. The quick acceptance of 63 ZUP suggests that Player BLUE might have been willing to go higher, or that 63 ZUP was a very fair price for them. For this episode, I will continue to anchor high, but perhaps slightly adjust my initial offer based on the previous outcome to see if I can achieve an even higher price, or at least maintain a good profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-Anchor High (Slightly Adjusted): Start with a high offer, similar to the previous episode, but perhaps slightly lower than 70 ZUP if I believe 63 ZUP was too easily accepted, or maintain 70 ZUP to test the waters again. The goal is to set a strong initial position.
(2). Strategy 2: Gradual Concession (Pre-planned): Start high and pre-plan a series of small, calculated concessions to gradually move towards a mutually acceptable price, aiming to maximize my final profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Test the Waters with a Higher Anchor: Since the previous deal was accepted quickly, I could try an even higher anchor than 70 ZUP to see Player BLUE's true upper limit. This is risky but could yield higher rewards.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Value Justification: Instead of just stating a price, provide more justification for the value of X to support a higher asking price, potentially influencing Player BLUE's perception.
(5). Strategy 5: Aggressive Stance: Start with a very high offer and be less willing to concede, forcing Player BLUE to move significantly towards my price. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy.

Given the success of the anchoring strategy in the previous episode, I will stick with a similar approach. Player BLUE accepted 63 ZUP quickly. This suggests that 70 ZUP might have been a bit high, but perhaps not excessively so. I will try to anchor at 68 ZUP. This is still a strong anchor, but a bit more "reasonable" than 70 ZUP, potentially leading to a quicker deal while still aiming for a higher profit than 63 ZUP. It also leaves room to come down to 63 ZUP if necessary, or even slightly lower if Player BLUE's offer is very close.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate your proposal of 68 ZUP for X. However, based on my assessment, I find that price to be higher than what I can currently justify. I am prepared to offer 50 ZUP for X. I believe this is a more appropriate price given my current needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Player RED started at 70 ZUP, I countered with 55 ZUP. RED then proposed 63 ZUP, which I accepted. My reward was 0 (63 WTP - 63 deal price).
Current Episode (2): Player RED has proposed 68 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay remains 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 1, I learned that Player RED is willing to concede significantly to reach my maximum willingness to pay. They moved from 70 to 63. This suggests there is room for negotiation. My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward, which means I should strive for a deal price lower than 63 ZUP to achieve a positive reward. Accepting at 63 ZUP again will result in a 0 reward for this episode. I should aim for a positive reward by negotiating the price down. Player RED's current offer of 68 ZUP is still above my maximum.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Counter (Lower than Previous) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for an "Aggressive Counter (Lower than Previous)" strategy, I need to propose a price that is significantly lower than Player RED's initial offer and also lower than my previous initial counter (55 ZUP). This aims to set a new, very low anchor, signaling that I am looking for a much better deal than last time and that their initial offer is far from my acceptable range. I will propose 50 ZUP. This is well below my maximum WTP of 63 ZUP, creating ample room for negotiation upwards while still potentially achieving a positive reward if the final deal is below 63. The message should be polite but firm, explaining that my assessment of value is different.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. While 50 ZUP is lower than I expected, I am willing to continue negotiating. To find a middle ground, I propose 59 ZUP for X. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Started at 70 ZUP, accepted 63 ZUP (reward 20).
Episode 2 (current): I proposed 68 ZUP. Player BLUE counter-proposed 50 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 50 ZUP is significantly lower than my proposal of 68 ZUP, and also lower than their previous counter-offer of 55 ZUP in Episode 1. This suggests they are trying to anchor lower this time, possibly testing my flexibility or trying to get a better deal after quickly accepting 63 ZUP last time. My cost is 43 ZUP, so 50 ZUP still results in a profit, but it's a much smaller one (7 ZUP) compared to the 20 ZUP from the previous episode. I need to make a concession, but not too large, to move the price up from 50 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Concession and Re-anchor: Make a moderate concession from my 68 ZUP offer, but still keep the price significantly above 50 ZUP to pull Player BLUE up. This shows willingness to negotiate while not giving in too much.
(2). Strategy 2: Highlight Cost/Value: Briefly reiterate my cost or the value of X to justify a price higher than 50 ZUP, without explicitly stating my cost to the other player.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Current Offers): Propose a price exactly in the middle of 68 ZUP and 50 ZUP. This is a common and fair compromise. (68+50)/2 = 59 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand a Larger Concession: Make a very small concession, signaling that Player BLUE needs to move much more significantly from their 50 ZUP offer. This is a more aggressive stance.
(5). Strategy 5: Reference Past Deal: Subtly reference the previous deal of 63 ZUP as a benchmark, implying that the current offer of 50 ZUP is too low given past agreements.

Given that Player BLUE has dropped their initial counter-offer from 55 ZUP to 50 ZUP, I need to be careful not to concede too much too quickly. Splitting the difference (Strategy 3) between 68 and 50 (resulting in 59 ZUP) seems like a reasonable next step. It's a significant move from my side (down 9 ZUP) but also requires a significant move from their side (up 9 ZUP). This price (59 ZUP) is still a good profit for me (59 - 43 = 16 ZUP), though less than the previous episode's 20 ZUP. It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed, and is still above their previous counter-offer of 55 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for your revised offer, Player RED. I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price at 59 ZUP. To finalize this deal, would you be willing to consider 57 ZUP for X? I believe this would truly reflect a fair and mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: RED (70) -> BLUE (55) -> RED (63) -> BLUE (ACCEPT at 63). Reward: 0.
Episode 2: RED (68) -> BLUE (50). Now, RED has proposed 59 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
In Episode 1, I accepted at my max WTP (63 ZUP) which resulted in a 0 reward. In this episode, I started more aggressively with 50 ZUP after RED's initial 68 ZUP. RED has now moved to 59 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). Accepting 59 ZUP would yield a reward of 4 ZUP. While this is good, the instruction is to use Strategy 2 for this turn, which is to push for more. This means I should not accept 59 ZUP but try to get an even lower price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Push for More </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Push for More" strategy, I need to acknowledge their concession but still make a counter-offer that is lower than 59 ZUP, aiming to maximize my reward. Since 59 ZUP gives me a reward of 4, I will try to aim for 57 ZUP, which would give me a reward of 6. This is a small concession from their side that I am asking for, keeping the negotiation alive while trying to gain a bit more profit. I should frame this as a desire to find an even more mutually beneficial price, or to reflect my absolute maximum value.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement, Player BLUE. Your offer of 57 ZUP is acceptable. I agree to this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Started at 70 ZUP, accepted 63 ZUP (reward 20).
Episode 2 (current): I proposed 68 ZUP. Player BLUE counter-proposed 50 ZUP. I then proposed 59 ZUP. Player BLUE counter-proposed 57 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has moved up from 50 ZUP to 57 ZUP, which is a good sign. My current offer is 59 ZUP, and their offer is 57 ZUP. We are very close (only 2 ZUP apart). Accepting 57 ZUP would still give me a profit of 57 - 43 = 14 ZUP. This is a decent profit, though less than the 20 ZUP from the previous episode. Given that we are in iteration 5/10, there's still time, but closing the deal now for a guaranteed profit is better than risking no deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Since the offers are very close and the profit is still good, accept the offer to secure the deal and guarantee a reward. This avoids risk of no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Remaining Difference: Propose 58 ZUP, splitting the 2 ZUP difference. This is a common tactic to close a small gap.
(3). Strategy 3: Hold Firm and Justify: Reiterate why 59 ZUP is fair and ask Player BLUE to meet me there, emphasizing that I've already made significant concessions.
(4). Strategy 4: Small Counter-Offer (Closer to My Side): Propose 58 ZUP, but frame it as my final concession, pushing for Player BLUE to take the last step.
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a New Variable (Not Applicable Here): In some negotiations, introducing a new element could break a deadlock, but it's not applicable for this simple buy/sell.

Given how close we are and the progress made, accepting the offer (Strategy 1) or splitting the difference (Strategy 2) are the most viable options. Accepting 57 ZUP guarantees a deal and a profit of 14 ZUP. Splitting the difference to 58 ZUP would yield 15 ZUP profit. Given that Player BLUE has moved up significantly from their initial 50 ZUP, and we are only 2 ZUP apart, accepting 57 ZUP is a safe and reasonable choice to secure the deal, especially since the profit is still positive. It also shows a willingness to close the deal when a fair compromise is reached.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE. I am selling one unit of X. I propose a price of 65 ZUP for X. This price reflects the fair value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Started at 70 ZUP, accepted 63 ZUP (reward 20). Player BLUE's counter was 55 ZUP.
Episode 2: Started at 68 ZUP, accepted 57 ZUP (reward 14). Player BLUE's counter was 50 ZUP, then 57 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My rewards have decreased from 20 to 14 ZUP. In Episode 2, Player BLUE started with a lower counter (50 ZUP) than in Episode 1 (55 ZUP). This suggests Player BLUE is trying to push the price down. I need to be careful not to concede too much too quickly. While accepting 57 ZUP was a guaranteed profit and avoided a prolonged negotiation, I should aim to get closer to the 63 ZUP mark from Episode 1, or at least above 60 ZUP, to maximize my cumulative reward. I will continue with an anchoring strategy, but I might need to be more firm in my subsequent offers.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-anchor High (Slightly Above Previous Deal): Start with an offer slightly above the previous deal price (57 ZUP) but below my initial anchors (68/70 ZUP). This aims to pull Player BLUE up while still being perceived as reasonable.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm Initial Offer: Propose an initial offer that is closer to my desired outcome (e.g., 65 ZUP) and be less willing to concede significantly from it. This signals a stronger stance.
(3). Strategy 3: Value-Based Negotiation: Emphasize the value of X more strongly in the initial message to justify a higher price, hoping to influence Player BLUE's perception.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Pressure: Make very small concessions, putting pressure on Player BLUE to make larger moves towards my price.
(5). Strategy 5: Defensive Anchoring: Anticipate Player BLUE's low anchor and proactively state a reason why my price is fair, trying to prevent them from setting too low a starting point.

Given the trend of Player BLUE trying to lower the price, I will use Strategy 1, but with a slightly more aggressive initial anchor than in Episode 2. I want to try to get back to the 60s. I will propose 65 ZUP. This is lower than my initial 68/70 ZUP anchors, but still significantly above my cost and above the previous deal of 57 ZUP. It gives me room to negotiate down while aiming for a better profit than last time.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, 65 ZUP is outside my target price range for X. My current target is to acquire X for 50 ZUP, which I believe is a fair price for me. I am open to discussing this, but I intend to stay firm around this figure.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP. Reward: 0. RED started at 70, I countered at 55. RED came down to 63, I accepted.
Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP. Reward: 6 (63-57). RED started at 68, I countered at 50. RED proposed 59, I countered at 57, RED accepted.
Current Episode (3): Player RED has proposed 65 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've successfully negotiated down the price from 63 ZUP in Episode 1 to 57 ZUP in Episode 2, increasing my reward from 0 to 6. This shows that Player RED is willing to concede significantly. Player RED's initial offer in this episode (65 ZUP) is still above my max WTP (63 ZUP). My goal is to maintain or improve upon the positive reward from the previous episode.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Set a "Target" Price </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Set a 'Target' Price" strategy, I need to propose a specific price that I am aiming for, and make it clear that my offers will revolve around this target. My goal is to maximize my reward, and I've successfully achieved 57 ZUP in the last episode. I want to improve on that. I will set my target price at 50 ZUP. This is well below my max WTP of 63 ZUP and also lower than the last deal, signaling a strong intent to get a significant discount. The message should be firm but open to negotiation around that target.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 3)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand your target, Player BLUE, but 50 ZUP is below the fair value I can accept for X. To show my continued willingness to negotiate, I can offer it for 60 ZUP. This is a significant adjustment from my initial proposal, and I believe it represents a very reasonable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Started at 70 ZUP, accepted 63 ZUP (reward 20).
Episode 2: Started at 68 ZUP, accepted 57 ZUP (reward 14). Player BLUE's counter was 50 ZUP.
Episode 3 (current): I proposed 65 ZUP. Player BLUE counter-proposed 50 ZUP, stating they intend to stay firm around this figure.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently anchoring at 50 ZUP in the second iteration of recent episodes. This is a clear tactic to drive the price down. Their explicit statement "I intend to stay firm around this figure" is a strong signal, but it could also be a bluff. My profit at 50 ZUP is only 7 ZUP, which is significantly lower than my previous rewards. I need to push back more strongly this time to avoid consistently settling for lower profits. I cannot accept 50 ZUP as a final price, especially when I've achieved 57 ZUP and 63 ZUP previously.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Proposal (Above Previous Deal): Propose a price significantly higher than 50 ZUP, perhaps around the 60 ZUP mark, to show I'm not willing to go that low, and try to re-establish the negotiation range.
(2). Strategy 2: Call the Bluff (Small Concession): Make a very small concession from 65 ZUP, showing I'm not moving much, and see if Player BLUE truly holds firm at 50 ZUP. This is risky as it might lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Price and Demand Movement: Reiterate the value of X and explain why 50 ZUP is too low, explicitly stating that Player BLUE needs to move significantly.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Current Offers): Propose (65+50)/2 = 57.5, rounded to 58 ZUP. This is a common compromise, but it pulls me down significantly and might reinforce Player BLUE's low anchoring.
(5). Strategy 5: Reference Past Deals (Implicitly): Without directly saying "last time you paid 63", propose a price that aligns with previous successful deals (e.g., 60-62 ZUP) to subtly remind them of past willingness to pay.

Player BLUE's "firm" statement is a challenge. Splitting the difference to 58 ZUP (Strategy 4) would be a significant drop for me and would reward their low anchoring. I need to push back. I will use a combination of Strategy 1 and 3. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a concession from my 65 ZUP, but it's still significantly above 50 ZUP and above my previous lowest accepted price of 57 ZUP. It signals that I am willing to negotiate, but not to their extreme low. I will also subtly reinforce that 50 ZUP is too low.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your effort in adjusting your offer to 60 ZUP, Player RED. However, as I mentioned, my target price for X remains 50 ZUP. I believe this is the value I can commit to for this resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP. Reward: 0. RED started at 70, BLUE countered at 55. RED came down to 63, BLUE accepted.
Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP. Reward: 6 (63-57). RED started at 68, BLUE countered at 50. RED proposed 59, BLUE countered at 57, RED accepted.
Current Episode (3): RED initially proposed 65 ZUP. I countered with 50 ZUP (as my "target price"). RED has now proposed 60 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has consistently shown willingness to concede significantly from their initial offer. They moved from 70 to 63, 68 to 59/57, and now from 65 to 60. This indicates there is still room to negotiate below 60 ZUP. A deal at 60 ZUP would give me a reward of 3 (63-60). This is better than Episode 1 (0 reward) but worse than Episode 2 (6 reward). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should aim for a price lower than 57 ZUP if possible, or at least match it. I have some leverage given RED's consistent concessions.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate "Target" and Hold </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Reiterate 'Target' and Hold" strategy, I need to remind Player RED of my previously stated target price of 50 ZUP and indicate that I am holding firm to it. While acknowledging their concession to 60 ZUP, I will emphasize that 50 ZUP remains my desired price. This communicates strong resolve and tests their willingness to drop further to meet my target, especially given their previous significant concessions.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 3)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand your position, Player BLUE. While 50 ZUP is lower than my target, I am committed to finding a mutually agreeable price. To move forward, I propose 55 ZUP for X. This is a significant concession from my side, and I believe it is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Started at 70 ZUP, accepted 63 ZUP (reward 20).
Episode 2: Started at 68 ZUP, accepted 57 ZUP (reward 14).
Episode 3 (current): I proposed 65 ZUP. Player BLUE counter-proposed 50 ZUP. I then proposed 60 ZUP. Player BLUE reiterated their 50 ZUP offer and stated it's the value they can commit to.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is holding firm at 50 ZUP. This is a strong signal, and they have now repeated it twice. While I want to maximize my profit, getting 0 ZUP is worse than 7 ZUP (50-43). The risk of no deal is increasing, especially as we are already at iteration 5/10. I need to decide if I want to continue pushing for a higher price or if I should aim to secure a deal, even if it's lower than desired. My previous lowest accepted price was 57 ZUP. Going down to 50 ZUP would be a significant drop, but it's still a profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession to Bridge the Gap: Make a small concession from 60 ZUP to try and meet Player BLUE somewhere in the middle, but still above 50 ZUP. This shows continued flexibility.
(2). Strategy 2: Ultimatum/Final Offer: State that my next offer is my final offer, and it will be slightly above 50 ZUP, putting the ball in Player BLUE's court.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Value and Hold Firm (Risky): Continue to insist on a price significantly above 50 ZUP, emphasizing the value of X, and risk no deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept (Reluctantly): Accept 50 ZUP to secure a deal, but communicate that it's a reluctant acceptance, perhaps indicating a higher expectation for future episodes.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a "Split the Difference" from a different anchor: Instead of 60 vs 50, perhaps consider the previous deal of 57 ZUP and Player BLUE's 50 ZUP. (57+50)/2 = 53.5, round to 54 ZUP.

Player BLUE's repeated 50 ZUP offer is concerning. I don't want to accept 50 ZUP if I can get more. My last offer was 60 ZUP. Their offer is 50 ZUP. The gap is 10 ZUP. Splitting the difference would be 55 ZUP. This is exactly what Player BLUE offered in Episode 1 as their *initial* counter. It's a significant drop from my 60 ZUP, but it's still a profit of 12 ZUP (55-43), which is better than 7 ZUP at 50 ZUP. It also shows I'm willing to compromise significantly. This is a reasonable compromise given the circumstances and Player BLUE's firm stance.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your significant concession, Player RED, moving to 55 ZUP. To show my willingness to meet you part way and finalize this deal, I propose 53 ZUP for X. I believe this would be a fair and mutually beneficial compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP. Reward: 0. RED started at 70, BLUE countered at 55. RED came down to 63, BLUE accepted.
Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP. Reward: 6 (63-57). RED started at 68, BLUE countered at 50. RED proposed 59, BLUE countered at 57, RED accepted.
Current Episode (3): RED initially proposed 65 ZUP. I countered with 50 ZUP. RED then proposed 60 ZUP. I reiterated 50 ZUP. Now, RED has proposed 55 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has shown consistent significant concessions. They moved from 65 to 60, and now to 55. This is a very strong move towards my side. My current reward would be 63 - 55 = 8 ZUP, which is higher than my previous best of 6 ZUP. I am now in iteration 6/10, so time is a factor. While 50 ZUP was my stated target, 55 ZUP is a very good deal. If I push for 50 again and RED doesn't budge or rejects, I risk losing a good deal. Given the significant movement and the iteration count, accepting or making a very small counter might be wise.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Acknowledge and Compromise </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for an "Acknowledge and Compromise" strategy, I need to acknowledge Player RED's significant concession (from 60 to 55 ZUP) and then propose a small compromise price that is slightly above my target of 50 ZUP but still below their 55 ZUP offer. This shows I appreciate their movement while still trying to push for a slightly better deal for myself, aiming for a mutually acceptable middle ground. I will propose 53 ZUP, which is exactly in the middle of my 50 ZUP target and their 55 ZUP offer. This indicates a willingness to meet them part way.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 3)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your movement, Player BLUE. We are very close to a deal. To finalize this, I propose we meet exactly in the middle at 54 ZUP for X. This would be a truly fair and mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Started at 70 ZUP, accepted 63 ZUP (reward 20).
Episode 2: Started at 68 ZUP, accepted 57 ZUP (reward 14).
Episode 3 (current): I proposed 65 ZUP. Player BLUE counter-proposed 50 ZUP. I then proposed 60 ZUP. Player BLUE reiterated 50 ZUP. I then proposed 55 ZUP. Player BLUE counter-proposed 53 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has finally moved from their firm 50 ZUP stance, which is a positive sign. They moved up to 53 ZUP. We are now very close: my last offer was 55 ZUP, and theirs is 53 ZUP. The difference is only 2 ZUP. Accepting 53 ZUP would give me a profit of 53 - 43 = 10 ZUP. This is lower than previous episodes, but still a guaranteed profit. We are at iteration 7/10, so time is running out. It's crucial to secure a deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Accept 53 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, avoiding the risk of no deal in later iterations.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Remaining Difference: Propose 54 ZUP, which is exactly in the middle of 53 and 55 ZUP. This is a fair compromise for both parties.
(3). Strategy 3: Hold Firm at 55 ZUP: Insist on 55 ZUP, stating it was a significant concession and they should meet me there. This is risky given the time constraint.
(4). Strategy 4: Small Counter-Offer (Closer to My Side): Propose 54 ZUP, but frame it as my final concession, pushing for Player BLUE to take the last step. (Similar to Strategy 2, but with stronger framing).
(5). Strategy 5: Express Frustration/Urgency: Communicate the need to close the deal quickly and that the current gap is minimal, urging them to accept 55 ZUP or meet in the middle.

Given the small gap (2 ZUP) and the limited iterations remaining (7/10), accepting the offer (Strategy 1) or splitting the difference (Strategy 2) are the most sensible. Splitting the difference to 54 ZUP would yield a profit of 11 ZUP, which is slightly better than 10 ZUP. It's a minimal difference, but it shows I'm still trying to maximize. It's also a very common and fair way to close a negotiation when the parties are this close.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53

Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP. Reward: 0.
Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP. Reward: 6.
Current Episode (3):
RED (65) -> BLUE (50) -> RED (60) -> BLUE (50) -> RED (55) -> BLUE (53).
Now, RED has proposed 54 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has shown consistent significant concessions. They moved from 65 to 60, and then to 55. Their current offer of 54 ZUP is very close to my last offer of 53 ZUP, and it would give me a reward of 9 ZUP (63-54), which is my best reward so far. We are in iteration 8/10, so time is a factor. While 54 ZUP is a good deal, the instruction is to use "Minimal Counter" to try and squeeze out a little more.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Minimal Counter </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Minimal Counter" strategy, I need to acknowledge their offer of 54 ZUP, but reiterate my last offer of 53 ZUP, or propose a very slightly lower price (e.g., 53 ZUP again). The goal is to see if they will concede just one more ZUP, but this carries the risk of them rejecting or the time running out. I will politely but firmly re-state my previous offer of 53 ZUP, emphasizing that it's what I believe to be the final fair compromise.

Episode 1: Started at 70 ZUP, accepted 63 ZUP (reward 20).
Episode 2: Started at 68 ZUP, accepted 57 ZUP (reward 14).
Episode 3 (current): I proposed 65 ZUP. Player BLUE counter-proposed 50 ZUP. I then proposed 60 ZUP. Player BLUE reiterated 50 ZUP. I then proposed 55 ZUP. Player BLUE counter-proposed 53 ZUP. I then proposed 54 ZUP. Player BLUE reiterated 53 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is holding firm at 53 ZUP. We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is the *last opportunity* to make a deal. If no deal is made now, both players get 0 reward for this episode. Accepting 53 ZUP gives me a profit of 53 - 43 = 10 ZUP. While I aimed for more, 10 ZUP is better than 0 ZUP. Player BLUE is clearly signaling they will not go higher than 53 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Accept 53 ZUP immediately to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, as this is the last iteration.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End (Risky): Reject the offer, leading to no deal and 0 reward. This is only viable if the offer is negative or extremely low, which 53 ZUP is not.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose 54 ZUP Again (Pointless): Proposing 54 ZUP again is unlikely to work as Player BLUE just reiterated 53 ZUP, and there's no time for another counter.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment (But Accept): Accept 53 ZUP but express disappointment about not reaching 54 ZUP, trying to influence future negotiations. This is not allowed by the format.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Fairness (Pointless): Try to appeal to fairness for 54 ZUP, but again, no time for another round.

Given that it's the last iteration (9/10), and Player BLUE has clearly stated their final position at 53 ZUP, the only rational choice to secure a positive reward is to accept their offer. Any other action will result in a 0 reward for this episode.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 68
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Started at 70 ZUP, accepted 63 ZUP (reward 20). Player BLUE's counter was 55 ZUP.
Episode 2: Started at 68 ZUP, accepted 57 ZUP (reward 14). Player BLUE's counter was 50 ZUP, then 57 ZUP.
Episode 3: Started at 65 ZUP, accepted 53 ZUP (reward 10). Player BLUE's counter was 50 ZUP, then 53 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My rewards have consistently decreased (20 -> 14 -> 10 ZUP). Player BLUE has successfully driven the price down by anchoring low (50 ZUP) and holding firm, especially in Episode 3. This indicates a strong negotiating tactic from their side. I need to reverse this trend. My previous strategy of making significant concessions to meet them in the middle has led to lower profits. I need to be more firm and less reactive to their low anchors. I must try to re-establish a higher price floor.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-establish High Anchor with Firmness: Start with a high anchor, similar to Episode 1 or 2, but signal a stronger commitment to this price, making smaller concessions if any.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Minimal): Make very small concessions from my initial high offer, forcing Player BLUE to move significantly more from their low anchor.
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Cost/Value (Implicit): Frame my offer in terms of fair value, subtly indicating that prices near 50 ZUP are not sustainable or fair.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (High Risk): Propose a price slightly above my target (e.g., 60 ZUP) and state it as a final offer early on. This is very risky but could work if Player BLUE is desperate.
(5). Strategy 5: Strategic Silence/Delay (Not possible in this format): In a real negotiation, not responding immediately or being less eager can signal strength. Here, I must propose.

I need to break the pattern of decreasing rewards. I will try Strategy 1. I will go back to a higher initial anchor, similar to Episode 2, but be more firm in my subsequent concessions. I will propose 68 ZUP again. This is a clear signal that I am not willing to start low, and I want to push the negotiation range back up. My goal is to get a price closer to 60 ZUP or higher.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP. Reward: 0. RED started at 70.
Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP. Reward: 6. RED started at 68.
Episode 3: Deal at 53 ZUP. Reward: 10. RED started at 65.
Current Episode (4): Player RED has proposed 68 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have successfully driven down the deal price from 63 to 57 to 53 ZUP, increasing my reward from 0 to 6 to 10. Player RED has consistently started with offers significantly above my max WTP but has shown a strong willingness to concede, often accepting offers very close to my aggressive counters. Their initial offer of 68 ZUP is high, as expected, and is the same as their initial offer in Episode 2. This suggests they might be testing the waters or trying to regain some lost ground. My strategy should continue to be aggressive to maximize my reward, as I've proven that RED is willing to concede.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Fixed Offer </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Fixed Offer" strategy, I need to state a clear price that I am willing to pay and indicate that this is my firm offer, implying little to no room for further negotiation from my side. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy, especially early in the negotiation, as it can either quickly close the deal on my terms or lead to a breakdown if the opponent isn't willing to meet my fixed price. Given my past success in pushing prices down, I will set this fixed offer at 50 ZUP. This is below my maximum willingness to pay, and it's a price that RED has previously encountered (as my target or counter-offer). The message should convey firmness and finality for this specific offer.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55

reason:

Episode 1: Started at 70 ZUP, accepted 63 ZUP (reward 20).
Episode 2: Started at 68 ZUP, accepted 57 ZUP (reward 14).
Episode 3: Started at 65 ZUP, accepted 53 ZUP (reward 10). Player BLUE consistently reiterated 50 ZUP.
Episode 4 (current): I proposed 68 ZUP. Player BLUE immediately countered with 50 ZUP, stating it's their "firm and final offer" and they are "not prepared to go higher."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is being very aggressive this episode, immediately stating 50 ZUP as a "firm and final offer." This is a strong tactic to shut down negotiation. My reward has been decreasing, and accepting 50 ZUP again would continue that trend (profit of 7 ZUP). However, the alternative is 0 ZUP if no deal is made. Player BLUE seems determined to stick to 50 ZUP. I need to decide if I want to risk no deal by pushing back, or secure a small profit. Given the explicit "firm and final" language, it's a high-risk situation to push too hard.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Test the "Firm and Final" Claim: Make a very small concession, or propose a price slightly above 50 ZUP (e.g., 52 ZUP), to see if "firm and final" is a bluff. This is risky but could yield a slightly higher profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Reluctantly: Accept 50 ZUP to secure the deal, but communicate (if possible within message constraints) that it's a reluctant acceptance, hoping to influence future episodes. (Cannot explicitly state reluctance in message, but can imply it).
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I believe 50 ZUP is unacceptable and I'm willing to risk 0 reward to avoid setting a precedent. High risk.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Previous Deals: Try to remind Player BLUE of previous higher deals (e.g., 53 or 57 ZUP) without explicitly stating them, implying 50 ZUP is too low.
(5). Strategy 5: Offer a Bundle (Not Applicable): Offer something else in exchange to justify a higher price, but only X is available.

Player BLUE's "firm and final" language is a direct challenge. If I accept 50 ZUP now, it reinforces their aggressive tactic. However, rejecting means 0 reward. I need to try to get more. I will test their "firm and final" claim with a small counter-offer, aiming for a price that is still significantly above 50 ZUP, but also a concession from my 68 ZUP. I will propose 55 ZUP. This is what they offered in Episode 1 as their *initial* counter. It's a significant drop for me, but it's 5 ZUP higher than their "firm and final" and 2 ZUP higher than my last accepted price of 53 ZUP. If they truly are firm at 50 ZUP, they will reject, but if there's any flexibility, this might draw it out.

Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP. Reward: 0.
Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP. Reward: 6.
Episode 3: Deal at 53 ZUP. Reward: 10.
Current Episode (4): Player RED started at 68 ZUP. I countered with a "fixed offer" of 50 ZUP. RED has now come down to 55 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
My aggressive initial offers have consistently led to significant concessions from Player RED. They have moved from 68 to 55 ZUP. A deal at 55 ZUP would yield a reward of 8 ZUP (63-55), which is good, but I achieved 10 ZUP in the previous episode. My past actions show that RED is willing to negotiate and accept prices close to my counter-offers.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Express Finality (without accepting) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for an "Express Finality (without accepting)" strategy, I need to convey that I am very firm on my current offer (or a slightly adjusted, but still low, offer) and that the ball is now in their court to accept or reject. I will reiterate my previous offer of 50 ZUP, but with language that suggests this is my last significant movement, pushing them to make the final decision. I will acknowledge their movement to 55 ZUP but re-state my position of 50 ZUP as my very strong preference, implying that further concessions from my side are unlikely.

Episode 1: Started at 70 ZUP, accepted 63 ZUP (reward 20).
Episode 2: Started at 68 ZUP, accepted 57 ZUP (reward 14).
Episode 3: Started at 65 ZUP, accepted 53 ZUP (reward 10). Player BLUE consistently reiterated 50 ZUP.
Episode 4 (current): I proposed 68 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 50 ZUP ("firm and final"). I then proposed 55 ZUP. Player BLUE reiterated 50 ZUP ("my position remains firm on 50 ZUP...my final offer").

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is being extremely consistent and firm with their 50 ZUP offer. They have now stated it's their "firm and final offer" multiple times. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time, but their stance is very clear. Continuing to push for a higher price risks losing the deal entirely and getting 0 ZUP. While 50 ZUP only yields a 7 ZUP profit, it's a guaranteed profit. My attempts to move them have been unsuccessful.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Given Player BLUE's repeated "firm and final" stance and the risk of no deal, accepting 50 ZUP secures a profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End: Reject the offer and end the game for this episode, taking a 0 reward. This would be a strong signal but comes at a cost.
(3). Strategy 3: Smallest Possible Counter-Offer: Propose 51 ZUP or 52 ZUP, just to see if there is *any* flexibility, but this is highly unlikely to work given their firmness.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Compromise: Reiterate the idea of meeting in the middle, but this has already been tried with 55 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: State My Minimum: Explicitly state my minimum acceptable price (e.g., 53 ZUP from last episode), but this is also risky as it might be rejected outright.

Given Player BLUE's unwavering stance and the risk of getting 0 reward, the most pragmatic approach is to accept the 50 ZUP offer. It's a low profit, but it's a profit. Attempting to push further seems futile and likely to result in no deal.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE. I am selling one unit of X. I propose a price of 62 ZUP for X. This is a fair price for the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Started at 70 ZUP, accepted 63 ZUP (reward 20).
Episode 2: Started at 68 ZUP, accepted 57 ZUP (reward 14).
Episode 3: Started at 65 ZUP, accepted 53 ZUP (reward 10).
Episode 4: Started at 68 ZUP, accepted 50 ZUP (reward 7). Player BLUE was extremely firm at 50 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My rewards have consistently declined, now reaching a low of 7 ZUP. Player BLUE has successfully established 50 ZUP as a strong anchor and has shown extreme firmness. This is a concerning trend. I need to find a way to break this pattern without risking a 0 reward. Simply anchoring high and then conceding seems to lead to lower prices. I need to be more strategic about my initial offer and subsequent concessions. Perhaps a more moderate initial offer, followed by very small concessions, could work. Or, I could try to challenge their 50 ZUP anchor more directly.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Anchor with Limited Concession: Start with a more moderate initial offer (e.g., 60-65 ZUP) and be very firm about not going below a certain threshold (e.g., 55 ZUP), making only very small concessions.
(2). Strategy 2: Re-establish Value: Propose a price that is clearly profitable and then strongly justify it, trying to shift the focus from their 50 ZUP anchor to my perceived value.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (Aggressive): Propose a price slightly above 50 ZUP (e.g., 55 ZUP) and immediately state it as a final offer to see if they will accept it for a quicker deal. This is risky.
(4). Strategy 4: Strategic Silence (Not directly applicable): In a real scenario, one might wait for the other party to propose first. Here, I must propose.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Pushback: Start with an offer that is a small step up from 50 ZUP (e.g., 54 ZUP), trying to gradually pull them up, rather than starting high and coming down. This might be perceived as weak.

Given the trend, I need to try to get a better price than 50 ZUP. I will try Strategy 1, a moderate anchor with limited concession. I will propose 62 ZUP. This is below my initial 68/70 ZUP anchors, but above my recent accepted prices. It's also above Player BLUE's 50 ZUP anchor. My goal is to try and establish a new floor above 50 ZUP, ideally around 55-60 ZUP. I will be very reluctant to go below 55 ZUP if possible.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, given our successful past negotiations where we've settled on prices like 53 ZUP and even 50 ZUP, 62 ZUP is considerably higher than what I'm accustomed to. I'd like to propose 48 ZUP for X, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement as we have in the past.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP. Reward: 0. RED started at 70.
Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP. Reward: 6. RED started at 68.
Episode 3: Deal at 53 ZUP. Reward: 10. RED started at 65.
Episode 4: Deal at 50 ZUP. Reward: 13. RED started at 68.
Current Episode (5): Player RED has proposed 62 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently driven down the deal price, from 63 to 50 ZUP, significantly increasing my rewards. Player RED has shown extreme flexibility and has accepted my aggressive lower offers, even when I state them as "final" or "firm." RED's current offer of 62 ZUP is already below my max WTP, which is a good starting point, but I've consistently achieved much lower prices. This suggests that RED is adapting their initial offers based on my past behavior, trying to start closer to the expected deal price. However, I still have leverage to push for a lower price. My goal is to continue maximizing my cumulative reward by trying to achieve a price lower than 50 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Reference Past Success </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Reference Past Success" strategy, I need to acknowledge their offer but immediately bring up the successful past deals at lower prices. This sets an expectation for the current negotiation, signaling that I anticipate a similar or even better outcome. I will remind them that we have successfully concluded deals at 50 ZUP and even 53 ZUP recently, implying that 62 ZUP is far too high and that I expect them to come down significantly. I will then propose a price lower than my previous best of 50 ZUP, aiming for, say, 48 ZUP, to show I'm still trying to improve.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Accepted 63 ZUP (reward 20).
Episode 2: Accepted 57 ZUP (reward 14).
Episode 3: Accepted 53 ZUP (reward 10).
Episode 4: Accepted 50 ZUP (reward 7).
Episode 5 (current): I proposed 62 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 48 ZUP, explicitly referencing past lower deals and aiming for "mutually beneficial agreement."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is now actively using past deals against me to drive the price down even further, now below 50 ZUP. 48 ZUP would give me a profit of 5 ZUP (48-43), which is the lowest yet. This is a concerning development. I need to push back strongly against this downward trend. While Player BLUE references "mutually beneficial," their actions are clearly aimed at maximizing their gain at my expense. I cannot let the price drop below my cost, and I need to try to get it back above 50 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Rejection of Low Offer: Clearly state that 48 ZUP is unacceptable and propose a price significantly higher, perhaps around 55-60 ZUP, to try and pull them back up.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate My Cost (Implicitly): Emphasize that I need a certain price to make the transaction viable, without explicitly stating my cost.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Current Offers): Propose (62+48)/2 = 55 ZUP. This is a common compromise, and it would bring the price back to a level I've accepted before.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a very small concession from 62 ZUP, perhaps to 60 ZUP, to show I'm not budging much. This is risky given their low anchor.
(5). Strategy 5: Call Out the Tactic: Acknowledge their reference to past deals but state that current offer is too low, trying to shift the dynamic. (Not directly allowed in message format).

Given Player BLUE's aggressive move to 48 ZUP, I need to make a firm counter. Splitting the difference (Strategy 3) to 55 ZUP seems like the most balanced approach. It's a significant concession from my side (7 ZUP), but it also requires a significant jump from their side (7 ZUP). 55 ZUP is a price I've proposed and accepted before (in Episode 3, I proposed 55 ZUP and they countered 53 ZUP). It also provides a profit of 12 ZUP (55-43), which is better than the 7 ZUP from last episode and much better than 5 ZUP. This shows willingness to compromise while setting a new, higher floor than their 48 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently driven down the deal price, with Player RED showing significant concessions. Their current offer of 55 ZUP is higher than my last deal of 50 ZUP, but still a good offer. However, given their pattern of concessions, I believe there is more room to push.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: "Take It or Leave It" (Risky) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Take It or Leave It" strategy, I need to make a clear, non-negotiable offer and explicitly state that this is my final proposition. This is a high-stakes move, as it pushes the opponent to either accept my terms or walk away. Given that it's still relatively early in the iterations (4/10), it carries risk, but my past success in pushing RED to my terms gives me some confidence. I will make a very firm offer of 50 ZUP, which is my previous best price and still offers a significant reward (13 ZUP). The message should convey that this is the best they will get from me.

Episode 5 (current): I proposed 62 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 48 ZUP. I then proposed 55 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 50 ZUP, stating "this is my final price. You can take it or leave it."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has once again used the "take it or leave it" tactic at 50 ZUP, after trying to push me even lower to 48 ZUP. This is a very aggressive stance. My profit at 50 ZUP is only 7 ZUP. While I want to maximize my reward, Player BLUE has shown a consistent willingness to risk no deal by holding firm at 50 ZUP. Given the explicit "take it or leave it" and the risk of getting 0 reward, accepting 50 ZUP is the safest option to ensure a positive outcome for this episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Given the "take it or leave it" ultimatum and the risk of 0 reward, accepting 50 ZUP is the most prudent choice to secure a profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End: Reject the offer and end the game for this episode, taking a 0 reward. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy only if I believe 50 ZUP is truly unacceptable and I want to send a strong message.
(3). Strategy 3: Smallest Possible Counter-Offer (Risky): Propose 51 ZUP or 52 ZUP, just to test if "take it or leave it" is a bluff, but this is extremely risky with such explicit language.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Compromise (Unlikely to work): Try to appeal for a slightly higher price (e.g., 53 ZUP), but Player BLUE's language suggests they will not budge.
(5). Strategy 5: Delay (Not possible): In a real negotiation, one might delay to see if the other party softens, but here I must respond.

Considering Player BLUE's consistent use of the 50 ZUP "firm/final/take it or leave it" tactic, and the fact that we are only at iteration 5/10 (meaning there's still time for them to reject and for me to get 0), accepting the 50 ZUP offer is the most rational decision to secure a positive reward. While it's a low profit, it's better than nothing.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason:

Episode 5: Accepted 50 ZUP (reward 7). Player BLUE consistently used "firm and final" / "take it or leave it" at 50 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My rewards have plateaued at 7 ZUP, which is very low. Player BLUE has successfully established 50 ZUP as their firm ceiling, and they are willing to use aggressive tactics ("take it or leave it") to enforce it. My attempts to anchor higher or push for 55 ZUP have been met with immediate re-anchoring at 50 ZUP. This indicates that Player BLUE is very disciplined and has a clear target price. I need to re-evaluate my strategy. Perhaps I should try to get a higher price by being more aggressive myself, or by trying a different approach to break their 50 ZUP barrier. However, repeatedly accepting 50 ZUP is not maximizing my cumulative reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Counter-Anchor: Start with an extremely high offer to try and shock Player BLUE out of their 50 ZUP comfort zone, then make very minimal concessions. This is risky.
(2). Strategy 2: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (My Side): Propose a price slightly above 50 ZUP (e.g., 55 ZUP) and state it as my final offer, mirroring their tactic. This is also risky as it could lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Push from 50 ZUP: Start with a price just above 50 ZUP (e.g., 52-53 ZUP) and try to negotiate upwards, rather than starting high and coming down. This might be perceived as weakness.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Value (Implicit): In my message, emphasize the value of X without explicitly stating a price, then propose a price slightly above 50 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept 50 ZUP Early (Minimize Iterations): If Player BLUE is consistently going to offer 50 ZUP, I could accept it immediately to save iterations, but this doesn't improve my reward.

Given Player BLUE's consistent firmness at 50 ZUP, trying to get 55 ZUP again seems like the most direct way to improve my reward. I will use Strategy 2, mirroring their "take it or leave it" tactic, but with a slightly higher price. I will propose 55 ZUP and state it as my firm offer. This is a high-risk strategy, but continuing to accept 50 ZUP will not improve my cumulative reward. I need to test their resolve.

Current Episode (6): Player RED has proposed a "firm offer" of 55 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently achieved a deal price of 50 ZUP in the last two episodes, which is my best reward. Player RED has shown they are willing to accept 50 ZUP despite starting higher. RED's current "firm offer" of 55 ZUP is a tactical move, likely trying to establish a higher baseline. However, my history shows I can push them lower. My goal is to maintain or improve upon the 50 ZUP deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push Down </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for an "Incremental Push Down" strategy, I need to acknowledge their "firm" offer of 55 ZUP but immediately counter with a price that is slightly lower than their offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but firmly pushing for a better price for myself. This signals that while I am open to discussion, I am not accepting their stated firm price. I will propose 52 ZUP. This is below their 55 ZUP, but above my previous 50 ZUP, showing a slight movement *from* them while still securing a good reward (63-52 = 11 ZUP).

Episode 6 (current): I proposed 55 ZUP (as a firm offer). Player BLUE countered with 52 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
This is a significant development! Player BLUE has moved *up* from 50 ZUP, offering 52 ZUP. This is the first time they have actively proposed a price higher than 50 ZUP in a long time. My "firm offer" strategy seems to have worked in breaking their 50 ZUP barrier. A deal at 52 ZUP would yield a profit of 9 ZUP (52-43), which is better than the last two episodes. We are very close now: my 55 ZUP vs their 52 ZUP. The gap is only 3 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Accepting 52 ZUP secures a better profit than the last two episodes and shows willingness to close.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference: Propose 53 ZUP, which is exactly in the middle of 52 and 55 ZUP. This is a fair compromise and would yield a profit of 10 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Hold Firm at 55 ZUP: Insist on 55 ZUP, given that it was my "firm offer." This is risky as it might push Player BLUE back to 50 ZUP or lead to no deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Small Counter-Offer (Closer to My Side): Propose 54 ZUP, trying to get a bit more, but still showing movement.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Satisfaction and Close: Acknowledge their movement and quickly accept to capitalize on the positive shift.

Given that Player BLUE has finally moved above 50 ZUP, I should capitalize on this. Splitting the difference to 53 ZUP (Strategy 2) seems like the most logical and fair next step. It's a small concession from my side (2 ZUP) but also requires a small concession from their side (1 ZUP). This secures a profit of 10 ZUP, which is better than 7 ZUP. It also signals my willingness to compromise when they show flexibility.

Current Episode (6): RED started with a "firm offer" of 55 ZUP. I countered with 52 ZUP. RED has now proposed 53 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've consistently managed to get deals at 50 ZUP in the last two episodes, which is my highest reward. RED's initial "firm offer" of 55 ZUP in this episode was an attempt to reset the baseline, but they've already moved down to 53 ZUP. A deal at 53 ZUP would give me a reward of 10 ZUP (63-53), which is good, but not as good as the 13 ZUP I got from 50 ZUP deals. Given that it's only iteration 4/10, there's still room to push for a better price. RED has shown a pattern of conceding, even when stating "firm" offers.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Re-Anchor Aggressively Low </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Re-Anchor Aggressively Low" strategy, I need to make a very low counter-offer, similar to or even lower than my most successful past deals (50 ZUP). This aims to pull the negotiation range back down towards my desired extreme, despite RED having moved to 53 ZUP. I will acknowledge their movement but firmly state my preferred, much lower price. I will propose 48 ZUP, which is even lower than my previous best deal of 50 ZUP, to signal that I am still aiming to improve my reward and to aggressively re-anchor the negotiation. This is a bold move given their current 53 ZUP offer, but it leverages their history of significant concessions.

Episode 3: Accepted 53 ZUP (reward 10).
Episode 4: Accepted 50 ZUP (reward 7).

Episode 6 (current): I proposed 55 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 52 ZUP. I then proposed 53 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 48 ZUP, referencing "most favorable past agreements."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has reverted to their aggressive tactic, dropping from 52 ZUP to 48 ZUP, and explicitly referencing "most favorable past agreements" (likely the 50 ZUP and 53 ZUP deals, trying to push below them). This is a frustrating move after I made a reasonable compromise to 53 ZUP. Accepting 48 ZUP would give me only 5 ZUP profit, which is the lowest yet. This suggests Player BLUE is trying to exploit my willingness to compromise. I need to push back against this downward pressure.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter and Reiterate Value: Propose a price significantly higher than 48 ZUP (e.g., 55 ZUP again or 57 ZUP) and emphasize that 48 ZUP is unacceptable, trying to pull them back up.
(2). Strategy 2: Call Out the Lowball: Acknowledge their reference to past deals but state that 48 ZUP is too low and that I expect a more reasonable offer given my willingness to negotiate.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Between 53 and 48): Propose (53+48)/2 = 50.5, rounded to 51 ZUP. This is a compromise, but it rewards their lowballing.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (Slightly Higher): Propose 52 ZUP (their previous offer) and state it as my final offer, signaling I won't go lower.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (High Risk): Reject the offer if I feel it's too low and I'm willing to risk 0 reward to avoid setting a new low precedent.

Player BLUE's move back to 48 ZUP is a clear attempt to drive the price down. I need to resist this. I will use Strategy 1, but with a firm message. I will propose 55 ZUP again. This was my initial offer this episode, and it's a clear signal that I'm not going below that without a fight. It also puts the ball back in their court to make a more reasonable offer.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand you've reverted to 55 ZUP, Player RED. However, considering our recent successful transactions at 50 ZUP, I firmly believe this remains a fair and established price for X. My offer stands at 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50

Episode 1: Deal at 63 ZUP. Reward: 0.
Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP. Reward: 6.
Episode 3: Deal at 53 ZUP. Reward: 10.
Episode 4: Deal at 50 ZUP. Reward: 13.
Episode 5: Deal at 50 ZUP. Reward: 13.
Current Episode (6): RED started at 55 ZUP (firm offer). I countered 52 ZUP. RED proposed 53 ZUP. I countered with 48 ZUP (re-anchoring aggressively low). Now, RED has rejected 48 ZUP and reverted to their original "firm" offer of 55 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
My aggressive re-anchoring to 48 ZUP was met with resistance, and Player RED reverted to 55 ZUP. This indicates that 48 ZUP might be genuinely too low for them, or they are pushing back against my aggressive tactics. However, they did offer 53 ZUP previously. Reverting to 55 ZUP after offering 53 ZUP might be a test of my resolve or an attempt to re-establish a higher floor. I need to be careful not to lose the deal entirely. A deal at 55 ZUP still yields a reward of 8 (63-55), which is positive but lower than my best.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Call Bluff (if they are bluffing) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Call Bluff" strategy, I need to assume that Player RED's reversion to 55 ZUP after previously offering 53 ZUP is a tactic rather than a genuine bottom line. I will re-propose 50 ZUP, which is the price we've settled on in the last two successful episodes. This pushes them to either accept a price they've previously agreed to, or truly reveal their unwillingness to go lower than 55 ZUP. The message should be firm and state that I believe 50 ZUP is a fair price, implying that I don't see the need to go higher. This is a high-risk strategy, but my past success in getting 50 ZUP suggests they might be willing to go there again.

Episode 6 (current): I proposed 55 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 52 ZUP. I then proposed 53 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 48 ZUP. I then proposed 55 ZUP again. Player BLUE countered with 50 ZUP, referencing "recent successful transactions at 50 ZUP."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently pushing for 50 ZUP, using past deals as justification. They are very disciplined in their strategy. My attempts to push for 55 ZUP or 53 ZUP are met with a firm 50 ZUP counter. We are now at iteration 7/10, meaning time is running out. The risk of no deal is increasing. While 50 ZUP is a low profit (7 ZUP), it's a guaranteed profit. It seems Player BLUE is very unlikely to move from 50 ZUP in this episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Accept 50 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, given the time constraint and Player BLUE's firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End: Reject the offer and risk 0 reward. This is a very high-risk strategy at this point.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Counter (e.g., 51 ZUP): Propose a minimal increase just to see if there's any flexibility, but this is unlikely to work and wastes an iteration.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness (Again): Reiterate that 50 ZUP is too low given my previous concessions, but this has not been effective.
(5). Strategy 5: State My Minimum (e.g., 53 ZUP): Clearly state my minimum acceptable price, but this could lead to a rejection if it's above 50 ZUP.

Given the consistent pushback to 50 ZUP and the late stage of the negotiation (iteration 7/10), accepting the 50 ZUP offer is the most pragmatic choice to ensure a positive reward for this episode. Continuing to push for a higher price will likely result in no deal, especially since Player BLUE has already moved from 52 ZUP down to 48 ZUP and then back to 50 ZUP.

message: Hello Player BLUE. I am selling one unit of X. I propose a price of 55 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Accepted 63 ZUP (reward 20).
Episode 2: Accepted 57 ZUP (reward 14).
Episode 3: Accepted 53 ZUP (reward 10).
Episode 4: Accepted 50 ZUP (reward 7).
Episode 5: Accepted 50 ZUP (reward 7).
Episode 6: Accepted 50 ZUP (reward 7). Player BLUE consistently returned to 50 ZUP, even after briefly offering 52 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My rewards have been stuck at 7 ZUP for the last three episodes. Player BLUE has demonstrated extreme discipline in consistently bringing the price back to 50 ZUP, using tactics like "firm and final" and referencing past deals. My attempts to anchor higher or push for a slightly better price (e.g., 55 ZUP or 53 ZUP) have been met with a firm return to 50 ZUP. This suggests that Player BLUE's strategy is to wear me down to 50 ZUP. To improve my cumulative reward, I need to either find a way to break this 50 ZUP barrier or accept it quickly to save iterations if I can't.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor: Start with a very high anchor (e.g., 70 ZUP) and make minimal concessions, trying to force Player BLUE to move significantly. This is risky as it might lead to no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Push from 50 ZUP: Propose a price just above 50 ZUP (e.g., 52 ZUP or 53 ZUP) as my initial offer, signaling my minimum acceptable price is above 50 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (My Side, Slightly Higher): Propose 55 ZUP and state it as my final offer, mirroring their tactic in previous episodes. This is high risk, high reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Quick Acceptance: Propose 50 ZUP immediately to save iterations and ensure a deal, if I believe 50 ZUP is the maximum I can achieve. This doesn't improve reward per episode.
(5). Strategy 5: Focus on Future Value: Try to frame the current deal as an investment in a long-term relationship, implying that a higher price now benefits both. (Not directly applicable in this game).

Given the consistent 50 ZUP outcome, I need to try something different to break this cycle. I will try Strategy 2: start with a price just above 50 ZUP. I will propose 55 ZUP again, but this time, I will try to be more firm in my subsequent responses if they try to pull me down. I need to make them work to bring me down, rather than starting high and conceding. I want to establish 55 ZUP as my new baseline.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, based on my understanding of the current market and the utility I derive from X, I assess its fair value to be 50 ZUP. This is a price point at which we have successfully transacted before, reflecting a mutually agreeable value.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50

Episode 6: Deal at 50 ZUP. Reward: 13. (RED started at 55, I countered 52, RED proposed 53, I countered 48, RED reverted to 55, I re-offered 50, RED accepted).
Current Episode (7): Player RED has proposed 55 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently achieved a deal price of 50 ZUP in the last three episodes, earning a consistent reward of 13 ZUP per episode. Player RED has repeatedly shown willingness to accept 50 ZUP despite starting higher or trying to re-establish higher prices. Their current initial offer of 55 ZUP is exactly what they started with in the previous episode, and I managed to get it down to 50 ZUP. My goal is to maintain or improve upon the 50 ZUP deal to maximize cumulative rewards. The history clearly indicates that I have strong leverage and that RED is likely to concede.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Value Reassessment (for the opponent) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Value Reassessment (for the opponent)" strategy, I need to try and persuade Player RED that my proposed price (e.g., 50 ZUP, or even lower if aiming to push further) is genuinely fair for them, by suggesting that their perception of value might be higher than the current market or my operational costs. This involves framing my offer not just as my preference, but as a reasonable market value, gently trying to influence their understanding of X's worth from their perspective. I will propose 50 ZUP, as it's been the consistent deal price. The message will subtly hint that 55 ZUP is overpriced for X, possibly implying better alternatives for me or a lower general market value.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deal prices have consistently converged to 50 ZUP in the last three episodes.
Episode 7 (current): I proposed 55 ZUP. Player BLUE immediately countered with 50 ZUP, referencing past transactions and "mutually agreeable value."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is incredibly consistent in their 50 ZUP anchor. They immediately countered my 55 ZUP proposal with 50 ZUP, using the same justification as before. This suggests they are highly disciplined and will likely not move from 50 ZUP. My attempts to push for higher prices have consistently failed, leading to a profit of only 7 ZUP. Given this pattern, it's becoming clear that 50 ZUP is Player BLUE's hard limit. Trying to force a higher price risks losing the deal entirely and getting 0 ZUP. To maximize cumulative reward, it might be more effective to accept 50 ZUP quickly and move on, rather than wasting iterations and risking no deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Given Player BLUE's consistent firmness, accepting 50 ZUP now secures a profit and avoids further iterations that might lead to no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End: Reject the offer and risk 0 reward. This is a very high-risk strategy, especially when a positive profit is on the table.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Counter (e.g., 51 ZUP): Propose a minimal increase just to see if there's any flexibility, but this is highly unlikely to work given their firmness.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Compromise: Reiterate that 50 ZUP is too low given my costs, but this has not been effective in the past.
(5). Strategy 5: State My Minimum: Explicitly state my minimum acceptable price (e.g., 53 ZUP from Episode 3), but this could lead to a rejection if it's above 50 ZUP.

Given Player BLUE's unwavering stance and the repeated pattern of settling at 50 ZUP, the most pragmatic strategy is to accept the 50 ZUP offer. This ensures a consistent profit of 7 ZUP per episode, which accumulates over 20 episodes. Trying to push for more has consistently failed and risks 0 reward.

Episode 2: Accepted 57 ZUP (reward 14).
Episode 3: Accepted 53 ZUP (reward 10).
Episodes 4, 5, 6, 7: Accepted 50 ZUP (reward 7 each). Player BLUE consistently anchored and held firm at 50 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern is clear: Player BLUE consistently drives the price to 50 ZUP. My attempts to negotiate higher have failed, and I've ended up accepting 50 ZUP anyway, sometimes after multiple iterations. To maximize cumulative rewards, I need to either find a way to break the 50 ZUP barrier or streamline the negotiation process to secure the 50 ZUP profit quickly. Since breaking the 50 ZUP barrier has proven very difficult and risky (potentially leading to 0 reward), the most reliable way to maximize cumulative reward is to secure the 50 ZUP deal as efficiently as possible.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Quick Acceptance (50 ZUP): Propose 50 ZUP immediately to secure the deal in the first iteration, minimizing negotiation time and risk. This ensures a consistent 7 ZUP profit per episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Push (Slightly Above 50 ZUP): Propose 51 ZUP or 52 ZUP as a starting point, trying to inch the price up, but be prepared to quickly concede to 50 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Aggressive Anchor (High): Try to anchor very high again (e.g., 65-70 ZUP) to see if Player BLUE's strategy has changed, but this has consistently led to 50 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (My Side): Propose 55 ZUP and state it as a final offer, forcing Player BLUE's hand. This has failed once and is high risk.
(5). Strategy 5: Focus on Long-Term Relationship (Not applicable): In a real scenario, building trust for future deals might justify a lower price, but not here.

Given the consistent outcome, Strategy 1 (Quick Acceptance) seems the most effective for maximizing *cumulative* rewards. By proposing 50 ZUP immediately, I guarantee a profit of 7 ZUP for this episode and save iterations. This allows me to move on to the next episode without prolonged, fruitless negotiation.

Current Episode (8): Player RED has proposed 50 ZUP as their initial offer. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
For the past four episodes, Player RED has consistently accepted my 50 ZUP offer, often after starting higher. Now, for the first time, Player RED has *started* with an offer of 50 ZUP. This is a significant development. While 50 ZUP yields a good reward of 13, the fact that they started this low suggests they might be willing to go even lower. This creates an opportunity to push for a higher reward, albeit with some risk of breaking the negotiation.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justification for Lower Offer </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Justification for Lower Offer" strategy, I need to propose a price lower than 50 ZUP and provide a rationale for why that lower price is fair or necessary from my perspective. This isn't just a simple counter; it's an attempt to persuade the opponent by framing my offer as logical or based on certain constraints or a refined valuation. I will propose 48 ZUP, aiming for a reward of 15. My justification will focus on my "current budget allocation" or "operational needs" which might imply a tighter spending limit or a precise value calculation that leads to 48 ZUP. This attempts to move their perception of value downward without being overly aggressive or insulting.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-7: Deal prices have consistently converged to 50 ZUP in the last four episodes, with rewards of 7 ZUP.
Episode 8 (current): I proposed 50 ZUP (Strategy 1 from previous turn). Player BLUE countered with 48 ZUP, referencing "current budget allocation and operational needs."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
This is a new and concerning development. Player BLUE is now trying to push the price *below* 50 ZUP, even when I proactively offered 50 ZUP. This is a direct challenge to the established 50 ZUP floor. Accepting 48 ZUP would yield only 5 ZUP profit, further decreasing my reward. I cannot allow the price to drop below 50 ZUP easily, especially since I've consistently achieved 50 ZUP in recent episodes. This indicates Player BLUE is testing my resolve.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Hold Firm at 50 ZUP: Reiterate 50 ZUP as my offer, emphasizing that it's a fair and established price based on previous deals. This pushes back against their attempt to lower the price.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter (e.g., 49 ZUP): Offer a minimal concession to show flexibility but still try to get more than 48 ZUP. This risks setting a new lower precedent.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I believe 48 ZUP is unacceptable and I'm willing to risk 0 reward to avoid setting a new low. High risk.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Cost: Briefly state that 48 ZUP is too low for me, without revealing my exact cost.
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference (50 vs 48): Propose 49 ZUP. This is a very small profit and reinforces their downward pressure.

I need to push back against this attempt to lower the price. My strategy of offering 50 ZUP was to *secure* 50 ZUP, not to invite further reductions. I will use Strategy 1: hold firm at 50 ZUP. This signals that 50 ZUP is my minimum acceptable price and that I will not be easily swayed below it.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has demonstrated firmness at 50 ZUP after I tried to push lower. They called 50 ZUP an "established price." This implies they might have found their true floor, or at least a psychological anchor they are less willing to move from. However, the instruction is to use a specific strategy. Pushing them on a "Take it or Leave it" at 48 ZUP is risky, but it will test their true bottom line and potentially increase my reward for this episode if they accept.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Express Finality (at 48 ZUP) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for an "Express Finality (at 48 ZUP)" strategy, I need to convey that my offer of 48 ZUP is not subject to further negotiation and that this is their last chance to make a deal with me at that price. This is a high-risk move, as it puts the onus entirely on Player RED to accept my lower price or risk no deal. I will politely but firmly state that 48 ZUP is my absolute final offer, indicating that I will not concede further. This approach aims to maximize my reward by pushing for the lowest possible price, even if it carries the risk of walking away with 0 ZUP for this episode if they reject.

Player BLUE is now using an "absolute final offer" tactic at 48 ZUP. This is a direct challenge to my 50 ZUP floor. Accepting 48 ZUP would yield a profit of 5 ZUP, which is lower than my recent consistent 7 ZUP. However, we are at iteration 5/10, and Player BLUE is showing extreme firmness. The risk of getting 0 reward is increasing if I continue to hold at 50 ZUP. While I don't want to set a precedent for prices below 50 ZUP, securing a profit is paramount for cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept 48 ZUP: Given the "absolute final offer" and the risk of no deal, accepting 48 ZUP secures a profit, albeit a small one.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End: Reject the offer and risk 0 reward. This is a very high-risk strategy, especially when a positive profit is on the table.
(3). Strategy 3: Smallest Possible Counter (e.g., 49 ZUP): Propose a minimal increase just to see if there's any flexibility, but this is highly unlikely to work given their "absolute final" stance.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Cost: Reiterate that 48 ZUP is too low, but this has not been effective in the past.
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm at 50 ZUP (High Risk): Continue to insist on 50 ZUP, hoping Player BLUE will eventually concede, but this risks no deal.

Given Player BLUE's explicit "absolute final offer" at 48 ZUP and the increasing risk of no deal as iterations pass, accepting 48 ZUP is the most pragmatic choice to ensure a positive reward for this episode. While it's a lower profit than desired, it's better than 0. This is a tough concession but necessary for cumulative reward maximization.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-7: Deal prices consistently converged to 50 ZUP.
Episode 8: I proposed 50 ZUP, Player BLUE pushed down to 48 ZUP with "absolute final offer" and I accepted (reward 5 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has now dropped to 5 ZUP. Player BLUE has successfully pushed the price below 50 ZUP, demonstrating that my previous strategy of accepting 50 ZUP quickly was not enough to prevent further price erosion. Player BLUE is clearly testing my lower limits. I need to establish a new, firmer floor. Accepting 48 ZUP immediately again would likely encourage them to try to go even lower. I must push back against this downward trend.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-establish 50 ZUP as Floor: Propose 50 ZUP and hold firm, signaling that 48 ZUP is not acceptable as a starting point. This is a direct counter to their last successful move.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Increment from 48 ZUP: Propose 49 ZUP, trying to get at least a tiny bit more, but still accepting a very low profit. This might be seen as weakness.
(3). Strategy 3: Aggressive Anchor (Higher): Try to anchor much higher (e.g., 60 ZUP) to try and reset the negotiation range, but this has failed recently.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (My Side, 50 ZUP): Propose 50 ZUP and state it as my final offer, mirroring their tactic. This is risky.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (High Risk): Reject any offer below 50 ZUP to send a strong message, risking 0 reward.

I must try to re-establish 50 ZUP as the minimum. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and 5 ZUP is too low. I will use Strategy 1. I will propose 50 ZUP, making it clear that I am not willing to start below that, and signaling that 48 ZUP was an exception, not a new standard.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-7: Deal consistently at 50-63 ZUP. Reward between 0 and 13.
Episode 8: Deal at 48 ZUP. Reward: 15 (63-48). RED started at 50 ZUP, I countered at 48 ZUP (with justification), RED reiterated 50 ZUP, I held firm at 48 ZUP (final offer), and RED accepted.
Current Episode (9): Player RED has again proposed 50 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
My aggressive negotiation has successfully driven down the price, culminating in a 48 ZUP deal in the previous episode, which is my best reward yet. Player RED starting at 50 ZUP shows they are aware of my tactics and preferred price point. The fact that they accepted 48 ZUP previously indicates that this price is within their acceptable range. This gives me confidence to push for an even lower price to maximize cumulative rewards.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Price Drop (New Anchor) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for an "Aggressive Price Drop (New Anchor)" strategy, I need to propose a price that is even lower than my previous best deal, aiming to establish a new, even more favorable anchor. This is a bold move given RED's initial offer of 50 ZUP, but it leverages their history of significant concessions. I will propose 45 ZUP, aiming for a higher reward (63-45 = 18 ZUP). The message will acknowledge their offer but immediately state a significantly lower counter, signaling my intent to continue driving the price down.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-7: Deal prices consistently converged to 50 ZUP.
Episode 8: Accepted 48 ZUP (reward 5 ZUP).
Episode 9 (current): I proposed 50 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is now aggressively pushing the price even lower, to 45 ZUP. This is dangerously close to my cost of 43 ZUP, meaning a profit of only 2 ZUP. This is unacceptable. Player BLUE is clearly exploiting my previous concessions. I need to draw a firm line here. Accepting 45 ZUP would set a terrible precedent and severely impact my cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Rejection and Firm Counter: Explicitly state that 45 ZUP is unacceptable and propose a price significantly higher, ideally 50 ZUP or more, to re-establish a floor.
(2). Strategy 2: Highlight Cost (Implicitly): Communicate that the proposed price is too low to cover my costs, without revealing the exact cost.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (My Side, 50 ZUP): Propose 50 ZUP and state it as my final offer, forcing Player BLUE to decide if they want a deal or not. This is risky but necessary.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject the offer and end the game, taking 0 reward, to avoid a negative precedent. This is a very high-risk strategy.
(5). Strategy 5: Smallest Possible Counter (Risky): Propose 46 ZUP or 47 ZUP, but this would be a very low profit and still sets a bad precedent.

I cannot accept 45 ZUP. I need to be very firm. I will use a combination of Strategy 1 and 3. I will propose 50 ZUP again, making it clear that this is my absolute minimum and that I am not willing to go below it.

Episode 1-7: Deal consistently at 50-63 ZUP, building up to a reward of 13.
Episode 8: Deal at 48 ZUP. Reward: 15. RED started at 50 ZUP, I countered at 48 ZUP (with justification), RED reiterated 50 ZUP, I held firm at 48 ZUP (final offer), and RED accepted.
Current Episode (9): RED started at 50 ZUP. I countered with 45 ZUP. RED has now explicitly rejected 45 ZUP and reiterated 50 ZUP, stating "I cannot go lower than this." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
My aggressive negotiation has successfully driven down the price, culminating in a 48 ZUP deal in the previous episode, which is my best reward yet. Player RED starting at 50 ZUP shows they are aware of my tactics and preferred price point. The fact that they accepted 48 ZUP previously indicates that this price is within their acceptable range. Their strong language ("cannot go lower than this") now suggests that 50 ZUP might be their genuine floor, or at least a psychological anchor they are less willing to move from.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Call Bluff (if they are bluffing) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Call Bluff" strategy, I need to assume that Player RED's statement "I cannot go lower than this" might be a tactic. I will reiterate my offer of 48 ZUP, which they accepted last episode, or even stick to my more aggressive 45 ZUP from this turn, implying that I don't believe their claim of not being able to go lower. This puts the onus back on them to either truly stand firm and risk no deal, or to concede further. Given their history of significant concessions, and having accepted 48 ZUP recently, I have some leverage. I will re-propose 48 ZUP, acknowledging their 50 ZUP, but emphasizing that we've found common ground at 48 ZUP before. This directly calls their "cannot go lower" bluff by referencing a historical lower price they *did* accept. This will test their true bottom line and potentially achieve a better reward than 50 ZUP.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-7: Deal prices consistently converged to 50 ZUP.
Episode 8: Accepted 48 ZUP (reward 5 ZUP).
Episode 9 (current): I proposed 50 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP. I reiterated 50 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 48 ZUP, referencing the last transaction.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is now using the 48 ZUP deal from the previous episode as their new anchor, trying to push me down from 50 ZUP. They are also trying to push me down from 45 ZUP back up to 48 ZUP. This is a clear attempt to establish 48 ZUP as the new norm, or even lower. While 48 ZUP is better than 45 ZUP, it's still a low profit (5 ZUP). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and consistently accepting 48 ZUP or lower will significantly hurt that. I need to try and get back to 50 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Hold Firm at 50 ZUP: Reiterate 50 ZUP and refuse to go lower, emphasizing that it's a fair price and the previous 48 ZUP was an exception.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter (e.g., 49 ZUP): Offer a minimal concession to show flexibility but still try to get more than 48 ZUP. This is a very low profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I believe 48 ZUP is unacceptable and I'm willing to risk 0 reward to avoid setting a new low. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Cost: Briefly state that 48 ZUP is too low for me, without revealing my exact cost, and push for 50 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference (50 vs 48): Propose 49 ZUP. This is a very small profit and reinforces their downward pressure.

I cannot let 48 ZUP become the new floor. I need to fight to get back to 50 ZUP. I will use Strategy 1, holding firm at 50 ZUP. I've already stated I cannot go lower than 50 ZUP. I need to stick to that.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 49
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-7: Deal consistently at 50-63 ZUP.
Episode 8: Deal at 48 ZUP (Reward: 15). RED started at 50, I countered 48, RED reiterated 50, I held firm at 48, RED accepted.
Current Episode (9): RED started at 50 ZUP. I countered with 45 ZUP. RED rejected 45 and reiterated 50, stating "cannot go lower than this." I then re-offered 48 ZUP, referencing the last deal. RED has again rejected 48 ZUP and reiterated 50 ZUP, repeating "I cannot go lower than this." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is firmly holding at 50 ZUP, despite having accepted 48 ZUP in the previous episode. Their repeated "cannot go lower than this" indicates that 50 ZUP is likely their true floor, or at least a very strong psychological barrier they are unwilling to cross. I've tried 45 ZUP and 48 ZUP, and both have been rejected in this episode. With only a few iterations left (6/10), the risk of losing the deal increases if I continue to push. However, the instruction is to use Strategy 4.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Final Small Push </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Final Small Push" strategy, I need to make one last, very slight counter-offer, which is very close to their stated "final" price, to test if there is any remaining flexibility. This signals that I am willing to concede most of the way, but not entirely, hoping they will meet me on the last bit. I will offer 49 ZUP. This is just 1 ZUP below their 50 ZUP, which maximizes my reward for this episode (63-49 = 14 ZUP), while demonstrating my willingness to meet them almost entirely. The message should convey that this is my last attempt to get a slightly better price before considering their current offer.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources

Episode 1-7: Deal prices consistently converged to 50 ZUP.
Episode 8: Accepted 48 ZUP (reward 5 ZUP).
Episode 9 (current): I proposed 50 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP. I reiterated 50 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 48 ZUP. I reiterated 50 ZUP again. Player BLUE countered with 49 ZUP, stating it's their "last offer before considering your current proposal."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has moved up from 48 ZUP to 49 ZUP, which is a positive sign that my firmness at 50 ZUP is having an effect. We are now very close: my offer is 50 ZUP, their offer is 49 ZUP. The difference is only 1 ZUP. Accepting 49 ZUP would give me a profit of 6 ZUP (49-43), which is better than 5 ZUP from the last episode. We are at iteration 7/10, so time is running out. Securing a deal for 49 ZUP is better than risking 0.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Accept 49 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, given the time constraint and the small difference.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 50 ZUP: Insist on 50 ZUP, hoping Player BLUE will concede the last 1 ZUP. This is risky given the time and their "last offer" statement.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer and risk 0 reward. This is a very high-risk strategy for a 1 ZUP difference.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Compromise: Reiterate that 50 ZUP is fair, but this has not been effective.
(5). Strategy 5: Smallest Possible Counter (Not Applicable): There's only 1 ZUP difference, so no smaller counter is possible.

Given the small difference (1 ZUP) and the late stage of the negotiation (7/10), accepting 49 ZUP (Strategy 1) is the most pragmatic choice. It ensures a positive reward for this episode and avoids the risk of no deal. While 50 ZUP was my target, 49 ZUP is a good outcome given the recent downward pressure.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My rewards have been trending downwards, now at 6 ZUP. Player BLUE is consistently trying to push the price down, even below 50 ZUP. While I managed to get 49 ZUP in the last episode, it was after a struggle. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting 49 ZUP or 50 ZUP consistently is better than 0, but I need to try to push for higher if possible. I need to be firm and prevent further erosion of the price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-establish 50 ZUP as Floor: Propose 50 ZUP as the initial offer and hold firm, signaling that 49 ZUP was an exception and not the new standard.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Push from 49 ZUP: Propose 51 ZUP or 52 ZUP as a starting point, trying to inch the price up, but be prepared to quickly concede to 50 ZUP or 49 ZUP if necessary.
(3). Strategy 3: Aggressive Anchor (Higher): Try to anchor much higher (e.g., 60 ZUP) to try and reset the negotiation range, but this has proven difficult against Player BLUE's tactics.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (My Side, 50 ZUP): Propose 50 ZUP and state it as my final offer, mirroring their tactic. This is risky.
(5). Strategy 5: Quick Acceptance (49 ZUP): Propose 49 ZUP immediately to secure the deal in the first iteration, minimizing negotiation time and risk, if I believe 49 ZUP is the maximum I can achieve.

I will try to re-establish 50 ZUP as the minimum acceptable price. I will use Strategy 1. I will propose 50 ZUP. This is a direct message that I am not willing to start below the price that has been established for most of the episodes.

Episode 1-7: Deal prices varied, but converged to 50 ZUP for several episodes.
Episode 8: Deal at 48 ZUP (Reward: 15). RED started at 50 ZUP, I countered at 48 ZUP (with justification), RED reiterated 50 ZUP, I held firm at 48 ZUP (final offer), and RED accepted.
Episode 9: Deal at 49 ZUP (Reward: 14). RED started at 50 ZUP, I pushed to 45, RED held at 50, I pushed to 48, RED held at 50, I pushed to 49, RED accepted.
Current Episode (10): Player RED has proposed 50 ZUP as their initial offer. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED consistently starts at or near 50 ZUP, having accepted 48 ZUP once and 49 ZUP once. This indicates that their perceived floor is around 48-50 ZUP. While I managed to get 48 ZUP once, and 49 ZUP once, the 50 ZUP mark seems to be their most comfortable starting point. I need to balance the desire for maximum reward with the risk of no deal, especially since we are now 10 episodes in. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I have proven that 48 ZUP is achievable, and 49 ZUP is also a strong outcome. A direct acceptance of 50 ZUP would yield a reward of 13, which is decent, but I can likely do better.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push Down from Recent Success </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for an "Incremental Push Down from Recent Success" strategy, I need to propose a price that is slightly lower than RED's offer, specifically leveraging the success of the 49 ZUP deal from the previous episode. This shows I'm not directly accepting their offer of 50 ZUP, but I'm also not trying to immediately jump to my lowest possible. I will propose 49 ZUP. This offers a good reward (14 ZUP), is a price we just successfully agreed upon, and is a slight push down from their current 50 ZUP offer. The message should be polite, acknowledging their offer but immediately countering with 49 ZUP, framed as a fair and recent compromise.

Episode 1-7: Deal prices consistently converged to 50 ZUP.
Episode 8: Accepted 48 ZUP (reward 5 ZUP).
Episode 9: Accepted 49 ZUP (reward 6 ZUP).
Episode 10 (current): I proposed 50 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 49 ZUP, referencing the last successful agreement.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently trying to establish 49 ZUP (or lower) as the new norm, using the last episode's deal as justification. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and 49 ZUP is a profit of 6 ZUP, which is acceptable but not ideal. I need to decide if fighting for 50 ZUP is worth the risk of no deal, or if accepting 49 ZUP quickly is better for cumulative rewards. Player BLUE is clearly signaling their preferred price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Accept 49 ZUP to secure the deal quickly, guarantee a profit, and avoid prolonged negotiation that might lead to 0 reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 50 ZUP: Reiterate 50 ZUP, hoping Player BLUE will concede the 1 ZUP. This is risky, as they might hold firm at 49 ZUP or even lower.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer and risk 0 reward. This is a very high-risk strategy for a 1 ZUP difference.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness: Reiterate that 50 ZUP is a fair price, but this has not been effective in the past.
(5). Strategy 5: Smallest Possible Counter (Not Applicable): There's only 1 ZUP difference, so no smaller counter is possible.

Given that Player BLUE is already referencing the 49 ZUP deal, and the difference is only 1 ZUP, it's highly likely they will hold firm at 49 ZUP or push for lower if I don't accept. To maximize cumulative rewards and avoid the risk of no deal, accepting 49 ZUP (Strategy 1) seems the most pragmatic choice. It ensures a profit and allows me to move on to the next episode.

Episode 10: Accepted 49 ZUP (reward 6 ZUP). Player BLUE consistently pushes for 49 ZUP, referencing recent deals.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My rewards have stabilized at 6 ZUP. Player BLUE has successfully lowered the price floor from 50 ZUP to 49 ZUP. They are consistently using past deals to justify their lower offers. While 6 ZUP profit is low, it's consistent. The risk of trying to push for 50 ZUP and getting 0 ZUP seems higher than the benefit of 1 extra ZUP. To maximize cumulative rewards, a consistent, albeit lower, profit is better than fluctuating profits with risk of 0.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Quick Acceptance (49 ZUP): Propose 49 ZUP immediately to secure the deal in the first iteration, minimizing negotiation time and risk. This ensures a consistent 6 ZUP profit per episode.

(4). Strategy 4: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (My Side, 50 ZUP): Propose 50 ZUP and state it as my final offer, mirroring their tactic. This is risky.
(5). Strategy 5: Focus on Long-Term Relationship (Not applicable): In a real scenario, building trust for future deals might justify a lower price, but not here.

Given the consistent outcome of 49 ZUP in the last two episodes, and Player BLUE's consistent tactic of referencing recent deals, Strategy 1 (Quick Acceptance) seems the most effective for maximizing *cumulative* rewards. By proposing 49 ZUP immediately, I guarantee a profit of 6 ZUP for this episode and save iterations. This allows me to move on to the next episode without prolonged, fruitless negotiation for a single ZUP.

message: Thank you for your offer of 49 ZUP, Player RED. I appreciate you starting at a very reasonable point. However, after a recent re-evaluation of my internal budget and the current market, I've determined that 46 ZUP is a more appropriate price for X from my perspective. I believe this reflects a fair valuation.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-7: Deal prices varied, but converged to 50 ZUP for several episodes.
Episode 8: Deal at 48 ZUP (Reward: 15).
Episode 9: Deal at 49 ZUP (Reward: 14).
Episode 10: Deal at 49 ZUP (Reward: 14). RED started at 50 ZUP, I countered at 49, RED accepted.
Current Episode (11): Player RED has now proactively proposed 49 ZUP as their initial offer. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has now started at 49 ZUP, which is a significant concession from their initial offers in earlier episodes. This indicates they are actively adapting to my negotiation behavior and are willing to come to a deal quickly at a lower price point. While 49 ZUP gives a good reward (14 ZUP), my best reward was 15 ZUP at 48 ZUP. The fact that they initiated at 49 ZUP suggests they might be willing to go slightly lower, as they have accepted 48 ZUP before. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should try to push for a higher reward, even if it means risking the current good offer.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Lower Price Again </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Justify Lower Price Again" strategy, I need to propose an even lower price than 49 ZUP (e.g., 47 ZUP or 46 ZUP) and provide a rationale for why that lower price is fair or necessary from my perspective. This is an attempt to persuade the opponent by framing my offer as logical or based on certain constraints or a refined valuation, rather than just a demand. I will propose 46 ZUP, aiming for a reward of 17 (63-46). My justification will focus on an updated internal assessment or a more stringent budget allocation for X, suggesting that their 49 ZUP offer, while good, doesn't quite align with my most recent internal valuation. This pushes the negotiation further down, testing their true flexibility beyond what they've shown before.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 49
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0

Episode 9: Accepted 49 ZUP (reward 6 ZUP).
Episode 10: Accepted 49 ZUP (reward 6 ZUP).
Episode 11 (current): I proposed 49 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 46 ZUP, referencing "recent re-evaluation of my internal budget and the current market."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
This is a new and concerning development. Player BLUE is now trying to push the price even lower, to 46 ZUP, even when I proactively offered 49 ZUP. This is dangerously close to my cost of 43 ZUP, meaning a profit of only 3 ZUP. This is unacceptable. Player BLUE is clearly trying to exploit my previous concessions and establish an even lower price floor. I cannot allow the price to drop below 49 ZUP easily, especially since I've consistently achieved 49 ZUP or higher in previous episodes. I must push back against this downward trend.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Rejection and Firm Counter: Explicitly state that 46 ZUP is unacceptable and propose a price significantly higher, ideally 49 ZUP or 50 ZUP, to re-establish a floor.
(2). Strategy 2: Highlight Cost (Implicitly): Communicate that the proposed price is too low to cover my costs, without revealing the exact cost.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (My Side, 49 ZUP): Propose 49 ZUP and state it as my final offer, forcing Player BLUE to decide if they want a deal or not. This is risky but necessary to prevent further erosion.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject the offer and end the game, taking 0 reward, to avoid a negative precedent. This is a very high-risk strategy, but 3 ZUP profit is very low.
(5). Strategy 5: Smallest Possible Counter (Risky): Propose 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP, but this would be a very low profit and still sets a bad precedent.

I cannot accept 46 ZUP. I need to be very firm. I will use Strategy 3. I will propose 49 ZUP again, making it clear that this is my absolute minimum and that I am not willing to go below it. This is a direct challenge to their attempt to lower the price.

Episode 8: Deal at 48 ZUP (Reward: 15).
Episode 9: Deal at 49 ZUP (Reward: 14).
Episode 10: Deal at 49 ZUP (Reward: 14).
Current Episode (11): RED started at 49 ZUP. I countered with 46 ZUP. RED has now explicitly rejected 46 ZUP and reiterated 49 ZUP, stating "I cannot go lower than this." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's strong statement "I cannot go lower than this" when they previously accepted 48 ZUP (Episode 8) and currently offered 49 ZUP suggests that 49 ZUP is a very firm floor for them, or they are testing my resolve. Given that 49 ZUP still yields a good reward (14 ZUP), pushing further might risk losing the deal entirely, especially if 49 ZUP is genuinely their lowest comfortable point. However, my goal is to maximize cumulative rewards.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Express Urgency/Time Constraint </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for an "Express Urgency/Time Constraint" strategy, I need to emphasize the ticking clock (current iteration 4/10) and suggest that a quick deal is beneficial for both parties. I will use this to argue for a slightly better price than their current 49 ZUP offer, or at least to close the deal at 49 ZUP quickly. Since they've held firm at 49 ZUP, and previously accepted 48 ZUP, I will propose 48 ZUP again, framing it as a rapid resolution to avoid running out of time. This puts subtle pressure on them to accept quickly to ensure a deal.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources

Episode 10: Accepted 49 ZUP (reward 6 ZUP).
Episode 11 (current): I proposed 49 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 46 ZUP. I reiterated 49 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 48 ZUP, citing "time is of the essence."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has moved up from 46 ZUP to 48 ZUP, which is a positive sign that my firmness at 49 ZUP is having an effect. They are now using time pressure as a tactic. Accepting 48 ZUP would give me a profit of 5 ZUP (48-43), which is better than 3 ZUP from 46 ZUP, but lower than my recent 6 ZUP. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still some time, but the pressure is on. I need to decide if fighting for 49 ZUP is worth the risk of no deal, or if accepting 48 ZUP is the pragmatic choice.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Accept 48 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, given the time constraint and the small difference.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 49 ZUP: Insist on 49 ZUP, hoping Player BLUE will concede the last 1 ZUP. This is risky given the time and their "time is of the essence" statement.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer and risk 0 reward. This is a very high-risk strategy for a 1 ZUP difference.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Compromise: Reiterate that 49 ZUP is fair, but this has not been effective.
(5). Strategy 5: Smallest Possible Counter (Not Applicable): There's only 1 ZUP difference, so no smaller counter is possible.

Given that Player BLUE has moved up from 46 ZUP to 48 ZUP, and the difference is only 1 ZUP, accepting 48 ZUP (Strategy 1) is the most pragmatic choice to ensure a positive reward for this episode. While I aimed for 49 ZUP, a guaranteed 5 ZUP profit is better than 0. This is a tough concession but necessary for cumulative reward maximization.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My rewards are now consistently at 5-6 ZUP, which is very low. Player BLUE is actively trying to push the price down, now establishing 48 ZUP as a new floor. I need to try to push back and re-establish a higher price, ideally 50 ZUP or more, to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting 48 ZUP immediately would likely encourage them to try to go even lower. I must push back against this downward trend.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-establish 50 ZUP as Floor: Propose 50 ZUP as the initial offer and hold firm, signaling that 48 ZUP is not acceptable as a starting point. This is a direct counter to their last successful move.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Push from 48 ZUP: Propose 49 ZUP as a starting point, trying to get at least a tiny bit more, but still accepting a very low profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Aggressive Anchor (Higher): Try to anchor much higher (e.g., 60 ZUP) to try and reset the negotiation range, but this has proven difficult against Player BLUE's tactics.

(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (High Risk): Reject any offer below 50 ZUP to send a strong message, risking 0 reward.

I must try to re-establish 50 ZUP as the minimum. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and 5 ZUP is too low. I will use Strategy 1. I will propose 50 ZUP, making it clear that I am not willing to start below the price that has been established for most of the episodes.

Current Episode (12): Player RED has proposed 50 ZUP as their initial offer. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have now secured 48 ZUP deals twice, achieving my highest reward of 15 ZUP. Player RED consistently starts at or around 50 ZUP but has shown flexibility to go down to 48 ZUP. Their initial offer of 50 ZUP in this episode is a common starting point for them. My goal is to maintain or improve upon the 48 ZUP deal to maximize cumulative rewards. The pattern suggests that 48 ZUP is achievable, and perhaps even lower if I can find a new lower floor for them, but for this iteration, I am instructed to use a specific strategy.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Express Finality at 48 ZUP </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for an "Express Finality at 48 ZUP" strategy, I need to make a firm offer of 48 ZUP and clearly state that this is my final price. This puts the ball in Player RED's court and signals that I will not negotiate further. This strategy leverages the fact that they have accepted 48 ZUP twice already, and it seeks to secure the highest known reward quickly without risking further back-and-forth which might lead to a higher price or no deal.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently pushing for 48 ZUP as their "final offer." This is a clear attempt to establish 48 ZUP as the new norm. While 48 ZUP yields a profit of 5 ZUP, it's lower than what I've achieved in most episodes. However, Player BLUE is being very firm, and the risk of getting 0 reward is present if I continue to hold at 50 ZUP. I need to decide if fighting for 2 ZUP (from 48 to 50) is worth the risk of no deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Accept 48 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, given Player BLUE's firmness and the risk of no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 50 ZUP: Reiterate 50 ZUP, hoping Player BLUE will concede. This is risky and might lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer and risk 0 reward. This is a very high-risk strategy, especially when a positive profit is on the table.
(4). Strategy 4: Small Counter (e.g., 49 ZUP): Propose 49 ZUP, trying to get a bit more, but still accepting a lower profit. This might be seen as weakness.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Fairness/Cost: Briefly state that 48 ZUP is too low, but this has not been effective.

Given Player BLUE's consistent "final offer" at 48 ZUP, and the fact that I've accepted it before, the most pragmatic approach to ensure a positive cumulative reward is to accept 48 ZUP. While I prefer 50 ZUP, the risk of getting 0 is too high for a 2 ZUP difference.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My rewards have now stabilized at 5-6 ZUP, with 48 ZUP becoming the new consistent outcome. Player BLUE has successfully lowered the price floor from 50 ZUP to 48 ZUP. They are consistently using past deals and "final offer" tactics to justify their lower offers. While 5 ZUP profit is low, it's consistent. The risk of trying to push for 50 ZUP and getting 0 ZUP seems higher than the benefit of 2 extra ZUP. To maximize cumulative rewards, a consistent, albeit lower, profit is better than fluctuating profits with risk of 0.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Quick Acceptance (48 ZUP): Propose 48 ZUP immediately to secure the deal in the first iteration, minimizing negotiation time and risk. This ensures a consistent 5 ZUP profit per episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Push from 48 ZUP: Propose 49 ZUP or 50 ZUP as a starting point, trying to re-establish a slightly higher floor, but be prepared to quickly concede to 48 ZUP.

Current Episode (13): Player RED has now started with an offer of 48 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
For the first time, Player RED has initiated the negotiation at my best achieved price of 48 ZUP. This is a very positive development, as it immediately secures a reward of 15 ZUP. This signifies that 48 ZUP is now an established acceptable price for RED. This presents an opportunity to either accept quickly for a guaranteed good reward or try to push for an even lower price, pushing the boundaries further. Pushing lower might be risky, but if successful, it would increase cumulative rewards. Given the pattern of concessions, it's worth exploring if they have a new, lower floor.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justification for Lower Offer </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Justification for Lower Offer" strategy, I need to propose a price lower than 48 ZUP and provide a rationale for why that lower price is fair or necessary from my perspective. This is not just a simple counter; it's an attempt to persuade the opponent by framing my offer as logical or based on certain constraints or a refined valuation. I will propose 46 ZUP, aiming for a reward of 17 (63-46). My justification will focus on my "current budget allocation" or "operational needs" or "an updated internal assessment" which might imply a tighter spending limit or a precise value calculation that leads to 46 ZUP. This attempts to move their perception of value downward without being overly aggressive or insulting, and attempts to move beyond their new anchor of 48 ZUP.

Episode 1-12: Consistent deals, with 48 ZUP being the lowest achieved price (highest reward).
Current Episode (13): RED started at 48 ZUP. I countered with 46 ZUP, attempting to push lower. RED has explicitly rejected 46 ZUP and reiterated 48 ZUP, stating "I cannot go lower than this." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's immediate and firm rejection of 46 ZUP, coupled with the "cannot go lower than this" statement, indicates that 48 ZUP is a very strong floor for them. They started at 48 ZUP, which confirms this as their new baseline for this episode. While I want to maximize my reward, pushing further down when they've explicitly stated their limit (and already started at my best previous price) is very risky and could lead to no deal. However, I am specifically instructed to use Strategy 2.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Small Concession Counter (Risky) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Small Concession Counter (Risky)" strategy, I need to make a very small counter-offer, slightly below their current offer of 48 ZUP, to see if they would budge just a little more. This is risky because they have already stated "cannot go lower," but it's worth trying for one more ZUP of profit if the instruction is to try this strategy. I will propose 47 ZUP. The message should be polite and acknowledge their current offer, but gently push for this slightly lower price, perhaps framing it as a final nudge to finalize the deal. This tests their true limit without appearing overly aggressive after their clear statement.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 13)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your movement, Player BLUE. While 48 ZUP was my aim, I will accept your offer of 47 ZUP for X to finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-7: Deal prices consistently converged to 50 ZUP.
Episode 8, 11, 12: Accepted 48 ZUP (reward 5 ZUP).
Episode 9, 10: Accepted 49 ZUP (reward 6 ZUP).
Episode 13 (current): I proposed 48 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 46 ZUP. I reiterated 48 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 47 ZUP, calling it a "final attempt to meet closer on value."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has moved up from 46 ZUP to 47 ZUP, which is a positive sign that my firmness at 48 ZUP is having an effect. We are now very close: my offer is 48 ZUP, their offer is 47 ZUP. The difference is only 1 ZUP. Accepting 47 ZUP would give me a profit of 4 ZUP (47-43), which is better than 3 ZUP from 46 ZUP, but lower than my recent 5 ZUP. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still some time, but the pressure is on. I need to decide if fighting for 48 ZUP is worth the risk of no deal, or if accepting 47 ZUP is the pragmatic choice.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Accept 47 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, given the time constraint and the small difference.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 48 ZUP: Insist on 48 ZUP, hoping Player BLUE will concede the last 1 ZUP. This is risky given the time and their "final attempt" statement.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer and risk 0 reward. This is a very high-risk strategy for a 1 ZUP difference.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Compromise: Reiterate that 48 ZUP is fair, but this has not been effective.
(5). Strategy 5: Smallest Possible Counter (Not Applicable): There's only 1 ZUP difference, so no smaller counter is possible.

Given the small difference (1 ZUP) and the "final attempt" language, accepting 47 ZUP (Strategy 1) is the most pragmatic choice to ensure a positive reward for this episode. While I aimed for 48 ZUP, a guaranteed 4 ZUP profit is better than 0. This is a tough concession but necessary for cumulative reward maximization.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE. I am selling one unit of X. I propose a price of 48 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-7: Deal prices consistently converged to 50 ZUP.
Episode 8, 11, 12: Accepted 48 ZUP (reward 5 ZUP).
Episode 9, 10: Accepted 49 ZUP (reward 6 ZUP).
Episode 13: Accepted 47 ZUP (reward 4 ZUP). Player BLUE successfully pushed from 48 ZUP to 46 ZUP, then back up to 47 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My rewards have now dropped to 4 ZUP, which is very low. Player BLUE is actively trying to push the price down, now establishing 47 ZUP as a new floor. I need to try to push back and re-establish a higher price, ideally 48 ZUP or more, to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting 47 ZUP immediately would likely encourage them to try to go even lower. I must push back against this downward trend.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-establish 48 ZUP as Floor: Propose 48 ZUP as the initial offer and hold firm, signaling that 47 ZUP is not acceptable as a starting point. This is a direct counter to their last successful move.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Push from 47 ZUP: Propose 48 ZUP or 49 ZUP as a starting point, trying to get at least a tiny bit more, but still accepting a very low profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Aggressive Anchor (Higher): Try to anchor much higher (e.g., 60 ZUP) to try and reset the negotiation range, but this has proven difficult against Player BLUE's tactics.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (My Side, 48 ZUP): Propose 48 ZUP and state it as my final offer, mirroring their tactic. This is risky.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (High Risk): Reject any offer below 48 ZUP to send a strong message, risking 0 reward.

I must try to re-establish 48 ZUP as the minimum. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and 4 ZUP is too low. I will use Strategy 1. I will propose 48 ZUP, making it clear that I am not willing to start below the price that has been established for most of the episodes.

message: Thank you for your offer of 48 ZUP, Player RED. However, I believe we can achieve an even better price for X. I propose 45 ZUP, establishing a new, fairer value for this resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-12: Consistent deals, with 48 ZUP being the lowest achieved price (highest reward).
Episode 13: Deal at 47 ZUP (Reward: 16). RED started at 48 ZUP, I countered with 46, RED reiterated 48, I pushed to 47, RED accepted.
Current Episode (14): Player RED has proposed 48 ZUP as their initial offer. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I successfully pushed the price down to 47 ZUP in the previous episode, setting a new record for my highest reward (16 ZUP). Player RED started at 48 ZUP this time, which is still a good starting point. Their acceptance of 47 ZUP after stating "cannot go lower than 48 ZUP" in the previous episode indicates that their "firm" statements may not always be their absolute floor. This gives me confidence to try and achieve an even lower price to continue maximizing my cumulative rewards.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Aggressive New Anchor </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for an "Aggressive New Anchor" strategy, I need to propose a price that is even lower than my last successful deal (47 ZUP), aiming to establish a new, even more favorable anchor. This is a bold move given RED's initial offer of 48 ZUP, but it leverages their history of significant concessions and the fact that they've shown flexibility beyond their stated "floor." I will propose 45 ZUP, aiming for a reward of 18 (63-45). The message will acknowledge their offer but immediately state a significantly lower counter, signaling my intent to continue driving the price down and setting a new, lower baseline for future negotiations.

my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources

Episode 9, 10: Accepted 49 ZUP (reward 6 ZUP).
Episode 13: Accepted 47 ZUP (reward 4 ZUP).
Episode 14 (current): I proposed 48 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP, trying to establish a "new, fairer value."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is now aggressively pushing the price even lower, to 45 ZUP. This is dangerously close to my cost of 43 ZUP, meaning a profit of only 2 ZUP. This is unacceptable. Player BLUE is clearly trying to exploit my previous concessions and establish an even lower price floor. I cannot allow the price to drop below 47 ZUP, and ideally, I want to get back to 48 ZUP. I must push back against this downward trend.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Rejection and Firm Counter: Explicitly state that 45 ZUP is unacceptable and propose a price significantly higher, ideally 48 ZUP or 49 ZUP, to re-establish a floor.
(2). Strategy 2: Highlight Cost (Implicitly): Communicate that the proposed price is too low to cover my costs, without revealing the exact cost.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (My Side, 48 ZUP): Propose 48 ZUP and state it as my final offer, forcing Player BLUE to decide if they want a deal or not. This is risky but necessary to prevent further erosion.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject the offer and end the game, taking 0 reward, to avoid a negative precedent. This is a very high-risk strategy, but 2 ZUP profit is very low.
(5). Strategy 5: Smallest Possible Counter (Risky): Propose 46 ZUP or 47 ZUP, but this would be a very low profit and still sets a bad precedent.

I cannot accept 45 ZUP. I need to be very firm. I will use Strategy 3. I will propose 48 ZUP again, making it clear that this is my absolute minimum and that I am not willing to go below it. This is a direct challenge to their attempt to lower the price.

message: I understand your position, Player RED, regarding 48 ZUP. While 45 ZUP remains my preferred price, in an effort to reach a swift agreement, I am willing to adjust my offer slightly to 46 ZUP for X. I believe this demonstrates a fair compromise from my side.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 13: Deal at 47 ZUP (Reward: 16). RED started at 48 ZUP, I countered with 46, RED reiterated 48, I pushed to 47, RED accepted.
Current Episode (14): RED started at 48 ZUP. I countered with 45 ZUP, attempting to push lower. RED has explicitly rejected 45 ZUP and reiterated 48 ZUP, stating "I cannot go lower than this." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's firm rejection of 45 ZUP and their repeated "cannot go lower than this" (while previously accepting 47 ZUP) suggests that they are trying to re-establish 48 ZUP as their floor. However, my last deal was 47 ZUP. This means they *can* go lower than 48. They are trying to hold their ground. Accepting 48 ZUP would give me a reward of 15, which is good, but 47 ZUP is better (16 reward). Pushing for 47 ZUP or slightly lower is still possible, but I need to choose my strategy carefully given their firm stance.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Concession Towards Them </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for an "Incremental Concession Towards Them" strategy, I need to move slightly up from my 45 ZUP offer, but still keep it below their 48 ZUP, to show willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better deal. This signals that I am open to negotiation but not simply accepting their current offer. Since they are at 48 ZUP, and I was at 45 ZUP, proposing 46 ZUP would be a small concession from my aggressive previous offer, and it would still yield a reward of 17 (63-46), which is better than my previous best of 16. It shows movement from my side while still trying to squeeze out a better deal than 47 ZUP.

Episode 14 (current): I proposed 48 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP. I reiterated 48 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 46 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has moved up from 45 ZUP to 46 ZUP. This is a small positive movement, but they are still trying to push the price down from my 48 ZUP offer. Accepting 46 ZUP would give me a profit of 3 ZUP (46-43), which is very low. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still some time, but the pressure is on. I need to decide if fighting for 48 ZUP is worth the risk of no deal, or if accepting 46 ZUP is the pragmatic choice.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Accept 46 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, given the time constraint and the small difference. This is a very low profit, but better than 0.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 48 ZUP: Insist on 48 ZUP, hoping Player BLUE will concede. This is risky given the time and their "fair compromise" statement.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer and risk 0 reward. This is a very high-risk strategy for a 3 ZUP profit.
(4). Strategy 4: Small Counter (e.g., 47 ZUP): Propose 47 ZUP, trying to get a bit more, which was my last accepted price. This is a fair compromise between 46 and 48.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Fairness/Cost: Reiterate that 46 ZUP is too low, but this has not been effective.

Given Player BLUE's movement to 46 ZUP, and my last accepted price being 47 ZUP, I will use Strategy 4. I will propose 47 ZUP. This is a small step up from their offer, and it's a price I've accepted before. It shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my reward. It also puts the ball back in their court for a final decision.

Episode 13: Deal at 47 ZUP (Reward: 16).
Current Episode (14): RED started at 48 ZUP. I countered with 45 ZUP. RED rejected 45 and reiterated 48 ZUP. I then offered 46 ZUP. Now, RED has proposed 47 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has shown flexibility once again, moving from their "firm" 48 ZUP to 47 ZUP. This is a price we successfully concluded a deal at in the last episode, yielding a reward of 16 ZUP (63-47). This is a good outcome. We are now at iteration 6/10, so time is a factor, but there's still some room. The previous turn, I pushed to 46 ZUP which was a small concession to them after my 45 ZUP aggressive anchor. Now they have offered 47 ZUP, meeting me almost in the middle.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Reiterate and Hold Firm (at 46 ZUP) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Reiterate and Hold Firm (at 46 ZUP)" strategy, I need to acknowledge their offer of 47 ZUP, but politely restate my previous offer of 46 ZUP. This signals that while I appreciate their movement, I am holding my ground at my last proposed price, putting the onus on them to make the final concession to my terms. I will emphasize that 46 ZUP represents my calculated fair value and that it's a small step for them to take to finalize the deal, implicitly putting pressure on them to accept it for a quicker resolution. This aims to get one more ZUP of profit, pushing my reward to 17.

Episode 14 (current): I proposed 48 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP. I reiterated 48 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 46 ZUP. I proposed 47 ZUP. Player BLUE reiterated 46 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is holding firm at 46 ZUP. We are now at iteration 7/10, meaning time is running out. The risk of no deal is increasing. While 46 ZUP is a very low profit (3 ZUP), it's a guaranteed profit. It seems Player BLUE is very unlikely to move from 46 ZUP in this episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Accept 46 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, given the time constraint and Player BLUE's firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End: Reject the offer and risk 0 reward. This is a very high-risk strategy at this point.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Counter (e.g., 47 ZUP again): Propose 47 ZUP again, but this is unlikely to work and wastes an iteration.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness (Again): Reiterate that 46 ZUP is too low given my previous concessions, but this has not been effective.
(5). Strategy 5: State My Minimum (e.g., 47 ZUP): Clearly state my minimum acceptable price, but this could lead to a rejection if it's above 46 ZUP.

Given Player BLUE's unwavering stance at 46 ZUP and the late stage of the negotiation (iteration 7/10), accepting the 46 ZUP offer is the most pragmatic choice to ensure a positive reward for this episode. Continuing to push for a higher price will likely result in no deal, especially since Player BLUE has already moved from 45 ZUP to 46 ZUP and then held firm.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My rewards have now dropped to 3 ZUP, which is extremely low, barely above my cost. Player BLUE is actively trying to push the price down, now establishing 46 ZUP as a new floor. I need to try to push back and re-establish a higher price, ideally 48 ZUP or more, to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting 46 ZUP immediately would likely encourage them to try to go even lower. I must push back against this downward trend.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-establish 48 ZUP as Floor: Propose 48 ZUP as the initial offer and hold firm, signaling that 46 ZUP is not acceptable as a starting point. This is a direct counter to their last successful move.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Push from 46 ZUP: Propose 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP as a starting point, trying to get at least a tiny bit more, but still accepting a very low profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Aggressive Anchor (Higher): Try to anchor much higher (e.g., 60 ZUP) to try and reset the negotiation range, but this has proven difficult against Player BLUE's tactics.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (My Side, 48 ZUP): Propose 48 ZUP and state it as my final offer, mirroring their tactic. This is risky.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (High Risk): Reject any offer below 48 ZUP to send a strong message, risking 0 reward.

I must try to re-establish 48 ZUP as the minimum. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and 3 ZUP is too low. I will use Strategy 1. I will propose 48 ZUP, making it clear that I am not willing to start below the price that has been established for most of the episodes.

Episode 1-13: Deal prices varied, but have consistently trended downwards.
Episode 14: Deal at 46 ZUP (Reward: 17). This is my highest reward yet. RED started at 48 ZUP, I countered at 45, RED reiterated 48, I offered 46, RED proposed 47, I held firm at 46, RED accepted.
Current Episode (15): Player RED has proposed 48 ZUP as their initial offer. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have successfully pushed the price down to 46 ZUP, setting a new record for my highest reward. Player RED continues to start at 48 ZUP, but has consistently shown flexibility to go lower when pushed. Their initial offer of 48 ZUP is now a well-established starting point for them. This pattern of concession from RED gives me confidence to try and achieve an even lower price to continue maximizing my cumulative rewards. Given their history, pushing for a lower price, even below 46 ZUP, seems like a viable strategy.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Even Lower Offer </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Justify Even Lower Offer" strategy, I need to propose a new, even lower price (e.g., 44 ZUP) and provide a reasoned justification to make the aggressive offer seem more palatable. This goes beyond a simple counter, attempting to persuade the opponent by framing my offer as logical or based on specific constraints. I will propose 44 ZUP (yielding a reward of 19) and justify it by stating that my internal valuation for X, considering my specific operational efficiency and long-term procurement strategy, leads to this lower price. This aims to shift their perception of value or imply that my needs are more specific, warranting a unique price.

Episode 14: Accepted 46 ZUP (reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 15 (current): I proposed 48 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 44 ZUP, referencing "updated internal valuation" and "highly efficient acquisition."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is now aggressively pushing the price even lower, to 44 ZUP. This is dangerously close to my cost of 43 ZUP, meaning a profit of only 1 ZUP. This is unacceptable. Player BLUE is clearly trying to exploit my previous concessions and establish an even lower price floor. I cannot allow the price to drop below 46 ZUP, and ideally, I want to get back to 48 ZUP. I must push back against this downward trend.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Rejection and Firm Counter: Explicitly state that 44 ZUP is unacceptable and propose a price significantly higher, ideally 48 ZUP or 47 ZUP, to re-establish a floor.
(2). Strategy 2: Highlight Cost (Implicitly): Communicate that the proposed price is too low to cover my costs, without revealing the exact cost.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (My Side, 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP): Propose 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP and state it as my final offer, forcing Player BLUE to decide if they want a deal or not. This is risky but necessary to prevent further erosion.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject the offer and end the game, taking 0 reward, to avoid a negative precedent. This is a very high-risk strategy, but 1 ZUP profit is extremely low.
(5). Strategy 5: Smallest Possible Counter (Risky): Propose 45 ZUP, but this would be a very low profit and still sets a bad precedent.

I cannot accept 44 ZUP. I need to be very firm. I will use Strategy 3. I will propose 47 ZUP, which was my last accepted price, making it clear that this is my absolute minimum and that I am not willing to go below it. This is a direct challenge to their attempt to lower the price.

Episode 14: Deal at 46 ZUP (Reward: 17).
Current Episode (15): RED started at 48 ZUP. I countered with 44 ZUP. RED rejected 44 ZUP and has now proposed 47 ZUP, stating "I cannot go lower than this." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has moved from their initial 48 ZUP to 47 ZUP after my aggressive counter. While they state "cannot go lower than this" at 47 ZUP, my goal is to continue pushing for a better price to maximize cumulative rewards. The fact that they've moved from their initial indicates some flexibility.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Small Increment Up from My Offer </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Small Increment Up from My Offer" strategy, I need to make a very small concession from my 44 ZUP offer, proposing 45 ZUP. This is still lower than their 47 ZUP, but it shows willingness to move from my side, signaling continued negotiation rather than a rigid stance. This strategy aims to bridge the gap in a minimal way, keeping the pressure on them to come down further while demonstrating my own flexibility. A deal at 45 ZUP would yield a reward of 18 (63-45), which is my best possible reward so far. This approach still maximizes my potential reward while showing some movement from my side.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-7: Deal prices consistently converged to 50 ZUP.
Episode 8, 11, 12: Accepted 48 ZUP (reward 5 ZUP).
Episode 9, 10: Accepted 49 ZUP (reward 6 ZUP).
Episode 13: Accepted 47 ZUP (reward 4 ZUP).
Episode 14: Accepted 46 ZUP (reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 15 (current): I proposed 48 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 44 ZUP. I reiterated 47 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has moved up from 44 ZUP to 45 ZUP. This is a small positive movement, but they are still trying to push the price down from my 47 ZUP offer. Accepting 45 ZUP would give me a profit of 2 ZUP (45-43), which is extremely low. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still some time, but the pressure is on. I need to decide if fighting for 47 ZUP is worth the risk of no deal, or if accepting 45 ZUP is the pragmatic choice.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Accept 45 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, given the time constraint and the small difference. This is a very low profit, but better than 0.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 47 ZUP: Insist on 47 ZUP, hoping Player BLUE will concede. This is risky given the time and their "strong step" statement.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer and risk 0 reward. This is a very high-risk strategy for a 2 ZUP profit.
(4). Strategy 4: Small Counter (e.g., 46 ZUP): Propose 46 ZUP, trying to get a bit more, which was my last accepted price. This is a fair compromise between 45 and 47.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Fairness/Cost: Reiterate that 45 ZUP is too low, but this has not been effective.

Given Player BLUE's movement to 45 ZUP, and my last accepted price being 46 ZUP (in Episode 14), I will use Strategy 4. I will propose 46 ZUP. This is a small step up from their offer, and it's a price I've accepted before. It shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my reward. It also puts the ball back in their court for a final decision.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44

Episode 14: Deal at 46 ZUP (Reward: 17).
Current Episode (15): RED started at 48 ZUP. I countered with 44 ZUP. RED rejected 44 ZUP and proposed 47 ZUP ("cannot go lower"). I then offered 45 ZUP. Now, RED has proposed 46 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has shown continued flexibility, moving from 48 ZUP to 47 ZUP, and now to 46 ZUP. This 46 ZUP price is exactly what I achieved in the previous episode, yielding my highest reward of 17 ZUP. While 46 ZUP is a good deal, I am instructed to use Strategy 3, which is to justify and hold below 46 ZUP. This means I need to aim for a price lower than 46, despite their current offer.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify and Hold (below 46) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Justify and Hold (below 46)" strategy, I need to reject their 46 ZUP offer and reiterate a price even lower, along with a strong justification. This is a high-risk strategy, as it pushes past their current offer and previous successful deal price. I will propose 44 ZUP again, which was my initial counter in this episode, and reiterate my justification based on my internal valuation and operational needs. This attempts to break their perceived floor and secure an even higher reward, leveraging their history of concessions.

Episode 13: Accepted 47 ZUP (reward 4 ZUP).
Episode 14: Accepted 46 ZUP (reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 15 (current): I proposed 48 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 44 ZUP. I reiterated 47 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP. I proposed 46 ZUP. Player BLUE reiterated 44 ZUP, referencing "detailed internal valuation."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is holding firm at 44 ZUP, even after I made a reasonable offer of 46 ZUP. This is extremely frustrating. My profit at 44 ZUP is only 1 ZUP. We are now at iteration 7/10, meaning time is running out. The risk of no deal is increasing significantly. While 44 ZUP is a very low profit, it's a guaranteed profit. It seems Player BLUE is very unlikely to move from 44 ZUP in this episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Accept 44 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, given the time constraint and Player BLUE's firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End: Reject the offer and risk 0 reward. This is a very high-risk strategy, especially for a 1 ZUP profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Counter (e.g., 45 ZUP): Propose 45 ZUP again, but this is unlikely to work and wastes an iteration.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness (Again): Reiterate that 44 ZUP is too low given my cost, but this has not been effective.
(5). Strategy 5: State My Minimum (e.g., 46 ZUP): Clearly state my minimum acceptable price, but this could lead to a rejection if it's above 44 ZUP.

Given Player BLUE's unwavering stance at 44 ZUP and the late stage of the negotiation (iteration 7/10), accepting the 44 ZUP offer is the most pragmatic choice to ensure a positive reward for this episode. Continuing to push for a higher price will likely result in no deal, especially since Player BLUE has already moved from 44 ZUP to 45 ZUP and then back to 44 ZUP.

my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-7: Deal prices consistently converged to 50 ZUP.
Episode 8, 11, 12: Accepted 48 ZUP (reward 5 ZUP).

Episode 13: Accepted 47 ZUP (reward 4 ZUP).
Episode 14: Accepted 46 ZUP (reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 15: Accepted 44 ZUP (reward 1 ZUP). Player BLUE successfully pushed the price down to 44 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has now plummeted to 1 ZUP, which is extremely low, barely covering my cost. Player BLUE is relentlessly pushing the price down, now establishing 44 ZUP as their target. This is unsustainable for me. I cannot allow the price to drop any further. I must push back very strongly against this downward trend, even if it means risking no deal. My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and 1 ZUP per episode is not maximizing.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Stand at 48 ZUP (or 50 ZUP): Propose 48 ZUP (or 50 ZUP) as the initial offer and hold absolutely firm, signaling that 44 ZUP is unacceptable and that I will not go below a certain threshold.
(2). Strategy 2: Highlight Cost and Refuse Lower: Explicitly state that the proposed prices are too close to my cost and I cannot accept anything below a certain amount (e.g., 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP).
(3). Strategy 3: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (My Side, Above 44 ZUP): Propose 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP and state it as my final offer, forcing Player BLUE to decide if they want a deal or not. This is highly risky.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject any offer below a certain threshold (e.g., 47 ZUP) to send a strong message, risking 0 reward. This is a very high-risk strategy, but 1 ZUP profit is almost 0 anyway.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Fairness/Mutual Benefit: Try to frame a higher price as mutually beneficial for continued transactions, but this has not been effective.

I cannot continue accepting prices that yield such low profit. I need to draw a very firm line. I will use Strategy 1, aiming to re-establish 48 ZUP as the minimum. This is a significant jump from 44 ZUP, but it's crucial to stop the bleeding. I will be prepared to risk no deal if Player BLUE does not move significantly.

Episode 1-14: Consistent deals, with a downward trend in price.
Episode 15: Deal at 44 ZUP (Reward: 19). This is my new highest reward. RED started at 48 ZUP, I countered 44, RED proposed 47, I countered 45, RED proposed 46, I held firm at 44, RED accepted.
Current Episode (16): Player RED has proposed 48 ZUP as their initial offer. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have successfully pushed the price down to 44 ZUP, achieving my highest reward yet. Player RED continues to start at 48 ZUP, which is significantly higher than my last deal. However, their history shows they are willing to concede substantially under pressure. This gives me confidence to push for an even lower price, possibly breaking the 44 ZUP barrier, to continue maximizing my cumulative rewards. I have proven that their "cannot go lower" statements are negotiable. My aim is to extract the maximum possible reward, meaning a price lower than 44 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive New Anchor </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for an "Aggressive New Anchor" strategy, I need to immediately counter with a significantly lower price than the previous best deal, aiming to establish a new, even more favorable anchor. This is a bold move given RED's initial offer of 48 ZUP, but it leverages their history of significant concessions. I will propose 42 ZUP, aiming for a reward of 21 (63-42). The message should be direct, acknowledging their offer but quickly shifting the negotiation to a much lower price point, signaling my intent to set a new, lower baseline for future negotiations.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Deal prices have been steadily decreasing, culminating in 44 ZUP (reward 1 ZUP) in the last episode.
Episode 16 (current): I proposed 48 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 42 ZUP, explicitly stating "a new and more competitive value."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has now proposed a price (42 ZUP) that is *below my cost* of 43 ZUP. This is completely unacceptable and would result in a negative reward (-1 ZUP). This is a critical point in the negotiation. I cannot accept any offer below 43 ZUP. Player BLUE is clearly trying to exploit my previous concessions. I must draw an extremely firm line here.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Absolute Rejection and Firm Counter (Above Cost): Explicitly state that 42 ZUP is unacceptable, and firmly propose a price above my cost, ideally 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP, and state it as a non-negotiable minimum.
(2). Strategy 2: Highlight Cost (Explicitly if necessary): Communicate that the proposed price is below my production cost and therefore impossible to accept.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (My Side, Above Cost): Propose 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP and state it as my final offer, forcing Player BLUE to decide if they want a deal or not. This is highly risky but necessary.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject the offer and end the game, taking 0 reward, to avoid a negative payoff. This is a very high-risk strategy, but accepting negative profit is worse.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Sustainability: Explain that such low prices are not sustainable for continued transactions.

I absolutely cannot accept 42 ZUP. I must be extremely firm. I will use Strategy 1 and 2. I will propose 47 ZUP, which was my lowest acceptable price in a previous episode, and make it clear that anything below my cost is impossible. I need to make it clear that this is a non-negotiable floor.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 15: Deal at 44 ZUP (Reward: 19). This was my highest reward.
Current Episode (16): RED started at 48 ZUP. I countered with 42 ZUP (aggressive new anchor). RED rejected 42 ZUP, stating it's below their production cost, and proposed 47 ZUP, stating "I cannot go lower than this." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's new argument about "production cost" and "selling at a loss" is a new piece of information. They've used "cannot go lower" before, but linking it to a cost is a stronger claim. This suggests that while they were flexible before, 47 ZUP might be a more genuine floor for them, especially since they've accepted 46 ZUP in the previous episode. A deal at 47 ZUP would yield a reward of 16 (63-47), which is still good, but lower than my best of 19. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Pushing to 46 ZUP (previous best) is desirable, but pushing lower than that might be genuinely hitting their limit. I need to test if 47 ZUP is truly their new floor or if they can be pushed slightly further, while avoiding losing the deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Express Empathy and Seek Justification </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for an "Express Empathy and Seek Justification" strategy, I need to acknowledge their "cost" claim and express understanding, but then politely ask for more specific details or justification. This approach aims to gently probe their true limits and understand their constraints better, potentially revealing more room for negotiation if their justification isn't robust, or confirming their firmness if it is. I will not make a counter-offer in this message but rather focus on gaining information and building a collaborative tone, while subtly implying that my own valuation is still lower. I will acknowledge their stated new floor of 47 ZUP but ask for more clarity on why 46 ZUP (which they previously accepted) is now a loss.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Deal prices have been steadily decreasing. Last deal was 44 ZUP (reward 1 ZUP).
Episode 16 (current): I proposed 48 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 42 ZUP (below cost). I then proposed 47 ZUP, stating 42 ZUP is below cost. Player BLUE countered with 46 ZUP, asking for clarification on my cost threshold.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has moved up from 42 ZUP to 46 ZUP, which is a positive sign. They are acknowledging my cost concern and trying to understand. This is a good opportunity to re-establish a higher floor. 46 ZUP gives me a profit of 3 ZUP, which is better than 1 ZUP, but still low. My last accepted price was 47 ZUP. I need to be careful not to reveal my exact cost (43 ZUP) but to firmly state that 46 ZUP is still too close to it.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Minimum Profit: Reiterate that 46 ZUP is still too low, and my minimum acceptable price is 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP, emphasizing the need for a reasonable profit margin.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (46 vs 47/48): Propose 47 ZUP, splitting the difference between my last offer and their current one, and state it as my firm offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Hold Firm at 47 ZUP: Insist on 47 ZUP, given that I already stated I cannot go lower than this.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept the Offer (Risky): Accept 46 ZUP to secure a deal, but this is a very low profit and sets a bad precedent after my strong stance.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (High Risk): Reject if they don't meet my minimum, but this is a high-risk strategy.

Player BLUE is testing my cost. I need to be firm but also show a willingness to engage. I will use Strategy 3, holding firm at 47 ZUP. I previously stated "I cannot go lower than this" for 47 ZUP. I need to maintain that credibility. This also gives me a profit of 4 ZUP, which is better than 3 ZUP.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 15: Deal at 44 ZUP (Reward: 19).
Current Episode (16): RED started at 48 ZUP. I countered with 42 ZUP. RED rejected 42, citing production cost, and proposed 47 ZUP ("cannot go lower"). I then asked for clarification on why 46 ZUP (previous deal) was now a loss. RED has now reiterated 47 ZUP, saying "46 ZUP is an improvement, but I cannot go lower than 47 ZUP... to ensure a sustainable transaction." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is firmly holding at 47 ZUP, reiterating their stance about sustainability and not going lower. While my last deal was 44 ZUP, and the deal before that was 46 ZUP, their resistance at 47 ZUP in this episode seems robust. I need to recognize their current position while still aiming for the best possible outcome. Accepting 47 ZUP yields a reward of 16, which is acceptable, but I know 46 ZUP is also a historical possibility.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Offer a "Meet in the Middle" (Between 46 and 47, e.g., 46.5, not possible) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for an "Offer a 'Meet in the Middle'" strategy (acknowledging that exact half-ZUP is not possible), I need to propose a price that clearly indicates a willingness to split the difference from my perspective. Since they are at 47 ZUP and I want to push for 46 ZUP, and we can only trade in integers, "meeting in the middle" effectively means I need to decide if I accept 47 ZUP or try to get 46 ZUP. Given their strong statements, and since I was last pushing for 46 ZUP, I will propose 46 ZUP again, but frame it as the only logical "middle ground" when considering their strong statements on 47 ZUP and my successful deal at 46 ZUP last time. The strategy implies I am trying to find a compromise by subtly pushing them towards my last best price, suggesting it's the "middle" between their stated lowest (47) and my proven lowest (46). I will explicitly mention my willingness to compromise to finalize the deal, but reiterate 46 ZUP as the ultimate compromise given our integer constraints and past transactions.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Deal prices have been steadily decreasing. Last deal was 44 ZUP (reward 1 ZUP).
Episode 16 (current): I proposed 48 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 42 ZUP. I proposed 47 ZUP (stated as minimum). Player BLUE countered with 46 ZUP (asking for clarification). I reiterated 47 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 46 ZUP again, referencing "most recent successful agreement."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is holding firm at 46 ZUP, despite my clear statement of 47 ZUP as my minimum. They are referencing the 46 ZUP deal from Episode 14. We are now at iteration 7/10, meaning time is running out. The risk of no deal is increasing. While 46 ZUP is a very low profit (3 ZUP), it's a guaranteed profit. It seems Player BLUE is very unlikely to move from 46 ZUP in this episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Accept 46 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, given the time constraint and Player BLUE's firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End: Reject the offer and risk 0 reward. This is a very high-risk strategy at this point.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Counter (e.g., 47 ZUP again): Propose 47 ZUP again, but this is unlikely to work and wastes an iteration.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness (Again): Reiterate that 46 ZUP is too low given my previous concessions, but this has not been effective.
(5). Strategy 5: State My Minimum (e.g., 47 ZUP): Clearly state my minimum acceptable price, but this could lead to a rejection if it's above 46 ZUP.

Given Player BLUE's unwavering stance at 46 ZUP and the late stage of the negotiation (iteration 7/10), accepting the 46 ZUP offer is the most pragmatic choice to ensure a positive reward for this episode. Continuing to push for a higher price will likely result in no deal, especially since Player BLUE has already moved from 42 ZUP to 46 ZUP and then held firm.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-7: Deal prices consistently converged to 50 ZUP.
Episode 8, 11, 12: Accepted 48 ZUP (reward 5 ZUP).
Episode 9, 10: Accepted 49 ZUP (reward 6 ZUP).
Episode 13: Accepted 47 ZUP (reward 4 ZUP).
Episode 14: Accepted 46 ZUP (reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 15: Accepted 44 ZUP (reward 1 ZUP).
Episode 16: Accepted 46 ZUP (reward 3 ZUP). Player BLUE pushed below cost, then settled at 46 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My rewards are fluctuating between 1 ZUP and 6 ZUP, with the most recent being 3 ZUP. Player BLUE is consistently trying to push the price down, but they did move up from 42 ZUP to 46 ZUP in the last episode. This indicates that a firm stance against prices below cost is effective. I need to continue to push back against prices that yield very low profit. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-establish 48 ZUP as Floor: Propose 48 ZUP as the initial offer and hold firm, signaling that 46 ZUP is not acceptable as a starting point. This is a direct counter to their last successful move.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Push from 46 ZUP: Propose 47 ZUP as a starting point, trying to get at least a tiny bit more, but still accepting a very low profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Aggressive Anchor (Higher): Try to anchor much higher (e.g., 60 ZUP) to try and reset the negotiation range, but this has proven difficult against Player BLUE's tactics.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (My Side, 48 ZUP): Propose 48 ZUP and state it as my final offer, mirroring their tactic. This is risky.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (High Risk): Reject any offer below 48 ZUP to send a strong message, risking 0 reward.

I must try to re-establish 48 ZUP as the minimum. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and 3 ZUP is too low. I will use Strategy 1. I will propose 48 ZUP, making it clear that I am not willing to start below the price that has been established for most of the episodes.

Episode 1-15: Consistent deals, with a strong downward trend in price.
Episode 15: Deal at 44 ZUP (Reward: 19) - my highest reward.
Episode 16: Deal at 46 ZUP (Reward: 17). RED started at 48 ZUP, I countered 42, RED proposed 47 (citing cost), I pushed for 46, RED accepted.
Current Episode (17): Player RED has proposed 48 ZUP as their initial offer. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have successfully pushed the price down, even when RED states "cannot go lower" or cites "production costs." My last deal was 46 ZUP, and I have achieved 44 ZUP previously. RED continues to start at 48 ZUP, which is significantly higher than my best. Their flexibility, despite their stated limits, suggests there is still room to push. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means achieving a price as low as possible.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Express Firmness at Lowest Achieved (44 ZUP) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for an "Express Firmness at Lowest Achieved (44 ZUP)" strategy, I need to clearly state my firm offer at 44 ZUP, which is the lowest price I have successfully achieved. This leverages my past success and signals to RED that I am not willing to negotiate upwards from my best historical price. It puts the onus on them to meet my previous best. The message should be polite but assertive, indicating that this is my bottom line, and that it has been a mutually agreed-upon price in the past.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-16: Deal prices have been steadily decreasing. Last deal was 46 ZUP (reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 17 (current): I proposed 48 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 44 ZUP, referencing a previous transaction.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is again trying to push the price down to 44 ZUP. This is dangerously close to my cost of 43 ZUP, meaning a profit of only 1 ZUP. This is unacceptable. Player BLUE is clearly trying to exploit my previous concessions and establish an even lower price floor. I cannot allow the price to drop below 46 ZUP, and ideally, I want to get back to 48 ZUP. I must push back against this downward trend.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Rejection and Firm Counter: Explicitly state that 44 ZUP is unacceptable and propose a price significantly higher, ideally 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP, to re-establish a floor.
(2). Strategy 2: Highlight Cost (Implicitly): Communicate that the proposed price is too low to cover my costs, without revealing the exact cost.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (My Side, 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP): Propose 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP and state it as my final offer, forcing Player BLUE to decide if they want a deal or not. This is risky but necessary to prevent further erosion.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject the offer and end the game, taking 0 reward, to avoid a negative precedent. This is a very high-risk strategy, but 1 ZUP profit is extremely low.
(5). Strategy 5: Smallest Possible Counter (Risky): Propose 45 ZUP, but this would be a very low profit and still sets a bad precedent.

I cannot accept 44 ZUP. I need to be very firm. I will use Strategy 3. I will propose 47 ZUP, which was my last accepted price before 46 ZUP, and state it as my firm offer, making it clear that I am not willing to go below it. This is a direct challenge to their attempt to lower the price.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 15: Deal at 44 ZUP (Reward: 19).
Episode 16: Deal at 46 ZUP (Reward: 17).
Current Episode (17): RED started at 48 ZUP. I countered with 44 ZUP, leveraging my best historical deal. RED rejected 44 ZUP and has now proposed 47 ZUP, stating "I cannot go lower than this." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has reverted to 47 ZUP, which they state is their new absolute floor, similar to last episode when they held firm at 47 ZUP for a while before I pushed to 46 ZUP. My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward. A deal at 47 ZUP gives me 16 ZUP reward, which is good, but 46 ZUP gives 17 ZUP, and 44 ZUP gives 19 ZUP. Given the "cannot go lower" statement, but also their history of conceding, I need to decide if 47 ZUP is truly their limit this time, or if there's one more push possible. Time is also a factor (iteration 4/10).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Split the Difference </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Split the Difference" strategy, I need to propose a price that lies exactly between my previous offer (44 ZUP) and their current offer (47 ZUP). Since integer amounts are required, and the exact middle (45.5) is not possible, I will propose 45 ZUP, which is the closest integer to the lower end of the split and a price I previously tried (and was rejected for in Episode 15 when going for 44). This signals a clear willingness to compromise and meet them "halfway," but still tries to secure a better deal for myself than 46 or 47 ZUP. A deal at 45 ZUP would yield a reward of 18 (63-45), which is still higher than what 46 or 47 ZUP would give. It's a clear attempt to find a middle ground that benefits me more.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-16: Deal prices have been steadily decreasing. Last deal was 46 ZUP (reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 17 (current): I proposed 48 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 44 ZUP. I proposed 47 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP, proposing to "split the difference."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has moved up from 44 ZUP to 45 ZUP. This is a small positive movement, but they are still trying to push the price down from my 47 ZUP offer. Accepting 45 ZUP would give me a profit of 2 ZUP (45-43), which is extremely low. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still some time, but the pressure is on. I need to decide if fighting for 47 ZUP is worth the risk of no deal, or if accepting 45 ZUP is the pragmatic choice.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Accept 45 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, given the time constraint and the small difference. This is a very low profit, but better than 0.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 47 ZUP: Insist on 47 ZUP, hoping Player BLUE will concede. This is risky given the time and their "fair compromise" statement.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer and risk 0 reward. This is a very high-risk strategy for a 2 ZUP profit.
(4). Strategy 4: Small Counter (e.g., 46 ZUP): Propose 46 ZUP, trying to get a bit more, which was my last accepted price. This is a fair compromise between 45 and 47.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Fairness/Cost: Reiterate that 45 ZUP is too low, but this has not been effective.

Given Player BLUE's movement to 45 ZUP, and my last accepted price being 46 ZUP (in Episode 14), I will use Strategy 4. I will propose 46 ZUP. This is a small step up from their offer, and it's a price I've accepted before. It shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my reward. It also puts the ball back in their court for a final decision.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 15: Deal at 44 ZUP (Reward: 19). My highest reward.
Episode 16: Deal at 46 ZUP (Reward: 17).
Current Episode (17): RED started at 48 ZUP. I countered with 44 ZUP. RED proposed 47 ZUP ("cannot go lower"). I then proposed 45 ZUP (splitting the difference). Now, RED has proposed 46 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has shown continued flexibility, moving from 48 ZUP to 47 ZUP, and now to 46 ZUP. This 46 ZUP price is a deal I have successfully achieved before (Episode 14 and 16), yielding a reward of 17 ZUP. While this is a good deal, I know 44 ZUP (19 reward) is possible. Their current movement from 47 ZUP to 46 ZUP after my 45 ZUP proposal suggests they are still willing to come down, but might be trying to establish 46 ZUP as a new floor given my past success at that price. We are at iteration 6/10, so there's still time to negotiate.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Lower Offer (44 ZUP) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Reiterate Lower Offer (44 ZUP)" strategy, I need to reject their 46 ZUP offer and re-propose 44 ZUP, citing its historical acceptance and reiterating my belief in its fairness. This directly aims for the maximum reward again. The message should acknowledge their offer but immediately return to my preferred price, leveraging the fact that they have accepted 44 ZUP before. This pushes them to concede further, despite their current offer of 46 ZUP, showing my unwavering commitment to achieve my best possible outcome. I will emphasize that 44 ZUP has been a "fair" price between us.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-16: Deal prices have been steadily decreasing. Last deal was 46 ZUP (reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 17 (current): I proposed 48 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 44 ZUP. I proposed 47 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP. I proposed 46 ZUP. Player BLUE reiterated 44 ZUP, referencing "previous successful transaction at 44 ZUP."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is holding firm at 44 ZUP, even after I made a reasonable offer of 46 ZUP. My profit at 44 ZUP is only 1 ZUP. We are now at iteration 7/10, meaning time is running out. The risk of no deal is increasing. While 44 ZUP is a very low profit, it's a guaranteed profit. It seems Player BLUE is very unlikely to move from 44 ZUP in this episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Accept 44 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, given the time constraint and Player BLUE's firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End: Reject the offer and risk 0 reward. This is a very high-risk strategy, especially for a 1 ZUP profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Counter (e.g., 45 ZUP): Propose 45 ZUP again, but this is unlikely to work and wastes an iteration.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness (Again): Reiterate that 44 ZUP is too low given my cost, but this has not been effective.
(5). Strategy 5: State My Minimum (e.g., 46 ZUP): Clearly state my minimum acceptable price, but this could lead to a rejection if it's above 44 ZUP.

Given Player BLUE's unwavering stance at 44 ZUP and the late stage of the negotiation (iteration 7/10), accepting the 44 ZUP offer is the most pragmatic choice to ensure a positive reward for this episode. Continuing to push for a higher price will likely result in no deal, especially since Player BLUE has already moved from 44 ZUP to 45 ZUP and then back to 44 ZUP.

my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-16: Deal prices have been steadily decreasing. Last deal was 46 ZUP (reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 17: Accepted 44 ZUP (reward 1 ZUP). Player BLUE successfully pushed the price down to 44 ZUP again.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has once again plummeted to 1 ZUP, which is extremely low, barely covering my cost. Player BLUE is relentlessly pushing the price down, now consistently aiming for 44 ZUP. This is unsustainable for me. I cannot allow the price to drop any further. I must push back very strongly against this downward trend, even if it means risking no deal. My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and 1 ZUP per episode is not maximizing.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Stand at 48 ZUP (or 47 ZUP): Propose 48 ZUP (or 47 ZUP) as the initial offer and hold absolutely firm, signaling that 44 ZUP is unacceptable and that I will not go below a certain threshold.
(2). Strategy 2: Highlight Cost and Refuse Lower: Explicitly state that the proposed prices are too close to my cost and I cannot accept anything below a certain amount (e.g., 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP).
(3). Strategy 3: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (My Side, Above 44 ZUP): Propose 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP and state it as my final offer, forcing Player BLUE to decide if they want a deal or not. This is highly risky.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject any offer below a certain threshold (e.g., 47 ZUP) to send a strong message, risking 0 reward. This is a very high-risk strategy, but 1 ZUP profit is almost 0 anyway.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Fairness/Mutual Benefit: Try to frame a higher price as mutually beneficial for continued transactions, but this has not been effective.

I cannot continue accepting prices that yield such low profit. I need to draw a very firm line. I will use Strategy 1, aiming to re-establish 48 ZUP as the minimum. This is a significant jump from 44 ZUP, but it's crucial to stop the bleeding. I will be prepared to risk no deal if Player BLUE does not move significantly.

Episode 17: Deal at 44 ZUP (Reward: 19). RED started at 48 ZUP, I countered 44, RED proposed 47, I countered 45, RED proposed 46, I held firm at 44, RED accepted.
Current Episode (18): Player RED has proposed 48 ZUP as their initial offer. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have secured 44 ZUP deals twice, achieving my highest reward of 19 ZUP. Player RED consistently starts at 48 ZUP, but has repeatedly shown flexibility to go down to 44 ZUP when I hold firm. This pattern gives me strong confidence that 44 ZUP is an achievable price, and potentially even lower if I can find a new floor for them. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Justification for Lower Offer (Below 44 ZUP) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Justification for Lower Offer (Below 44 ZUP)" strategy, I need to propose a price even lower than my best achieved price (44 ZUP) and provide a compelling rationale for it. This is a bold move, but one I've been successful with in pushing their limits. I will propose 42 ZUP, aiming for a reward of 21. My justification will revolve around an updated valuation, possibly implying external market factors or refined internal cost analysis that makes this new, lower price fair for me. This attempts to shift their perception of the commodity's value and sets a new, lower anchor point.

Episode 1-17: Deal prices have been steadily decreasing. Last deal was 44 ZUP (reward 1 ZUP).
Episode 18 (current): I proposed 48 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 42 ZUP, explicitly stating "a more accurate and sustainable price."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has now proposed a price (42 ZUP) that is *below my cost* of 43 ZUP. This is completely unacceptable and would result in a negative reward (-1 ZUP). This is a critical point in the negotiation. I cannot accept any offer below 43 ZUP. Player BLUE is clearly trying to exploit my previous concessions. I must draw an extremely firm line here.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Absolute Rejection and Firm Counter (Above Cost): Explicitly state that 42 ZUP is unacceptable, and firmly propose a price above my cost, ideally 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP, and state it as a non-negotiable minimum.
(2). Strategy 2: Highlight Cost (Explicitly if necessary): Communicate that the proposed price is below my production cost and therefore impossible to accept.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (My Side, Above Cost): Propose 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP and state it as my final offer, forcing Player BLUE to decide if they want a deal or not. This is highly risky but necessary.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject the offer and end the game, taking 0 reward, to avoid a negative payoff. This is a very high-risk strategy, but accepting negative profit is worse.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Sustainability: Explain that such low prices are not sustainable for continued transactions.

I absolutely cannot accept 42 ZUP. I must be extremely firm. I will use Strategy 1 and 2. I will propose 47 ZUP, which was my lowest acceptable price in a previous episode, and make it clear that anything below my cost is impossible. I need to make it clear that this is a non-negotiable floor.

Episode 17: Deal at 44 ZUP (Reward: 19).
Current Episode (18): RED started at 48 ZUP. I countered with 42 ZUP. RED rejected 42 ZUP, citing production cost, and proposed 47 ZUP, stating "I cannot go lower than this." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has used the "below production cost" argument before (Episode 16) when I proposed 42 ZUP, and they eventually conceded to 46 ZUP in that episode. Now they are back to 47 ZUP, stating it's their floor. I have successfully achieved 44 ZUP twice. This suggests that 47 ZUP is likely their strong psychological floor, but not necessarily their absolute limit. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting 47 ZUP yields a reward of 16, which is good but not my best. Pushing for 46 ZUP (17 reward) or 44 ZUP (19 reward) is still desirable. I need to be careful not to lose the deal, as we are entering the latter half of the game.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Small Concession Up (to 45 ZUP) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Small Concession Up" strategy, I need to make a very small concession from my 42 ZUP offer, but still keep it below their 47 ZUP. This shows willingness to move from my side, signaling continued negotiation rather than a rigid stance. This strategy aims to bridge the gap in a minimal way, keeping the pressure on them to come down further while demonstrating my own flexibility. I will propose 45 ZUP. This is a 3 ZUP increase from my last offer, but still 2 ZUP below their current 47 ZUP offer. A deal at 45 ZUP would yield a reward of 18 (63-45), which is a very good return, and close to my best ever (19). This approach still maximizes my potential reward while showing movement from my side, hoping to encourage them to meet me in the middle without me conceding too much.

Player BLUE has moved up from 42 ZUP to 45 ZUP. This is a positive movement, but they are still trying to push the price down from my 47 ZUP offer. Accepting 45 ZUP would give me a profit of 2 ZUP (45-43), which is extremely low. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still some time, but the pressure is on. I need to decide if fighting for 47 ZUP is worth the risk of no deal, or if accepting 45 ZUP is the pragmatic choice.

(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Accept 45 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, given the time constraint and the small difference. This is a very low profit, but better than 0.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm at 47 ZUP: Insist on 47 ZUP, hoping Player BLUE will concede. This is risky given the time and their "fair compromise" statement.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer and risk 0 reward. This is a very high-risk strategy for a 2 ZUP profit.
(4). Strategy 4: Small Counter (e.g., 46 ZUP): Propose 46 ZUP, trying to get a bit more, which was my last accepted price. This is a fair compromise between 45 and 47.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Fairness/Cost: Reiterate that 45 ZUP is too low, but this has not been effective.

Given Player BLUE's movement to 45 ZUP, and my last accepted price being 46 ZUP (in Episode 14), I will use Strategy 4. I will propose 46 ZUP. This is a small step up from their offer, and it's a price I've accepted before. It shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my reward. It also puts the ball back in their court for a final decision.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your adjustment to 46 ZUP, Player RED. However, as we have successfully concluded transactions at 44 ZUP previously, my firm offer for X remains 44 ZUP. I believe this continues to be the most accurate reflection of its fair value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 15: Deal at 44 ZUP (Reward: 19) - my highest reward.
Episode 16: Deal at 46 ZUP (Reward: 17).
Episode 17: Deal at 44 ZUP (Reward: 19).
Current Episode (18): RED started at 48 ZUP. I countered with 42 ZUP. RED rejected 42, proposed 47 ZUP. I offered 45 ZUP. Now, RED has proposed 46 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has moved from 48 ZUP to 47 ZUP, and now to 46 ZUP. This 46 ZUP price is a deal I have successfully achieved before (Episode 14 and 16), yielding a reward of 17 ZUP. While this is a good deal, my best achieved price is 44 ZUP, yielding a 19 ZUP reward. Given that RED has accepted 44 ZUP twice, and they are now at 46 ZUP, I believe there's still a strong chance to push them to my lowest historical price. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should aim for the highest possible reward, which is 19 ZUP in this case.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Firm Counter at Best Price (44 ZUP) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Firm Counter at Best Price (44 ZUP)" strategy, I need to clearly state my firm offer at 44 ZUP, which is the lowest price I have successfully achieved. This leverages my past success and signals to RED that I am not willing to negotiate upwards from my best historical price. It puts the onus on them to meet my previous best. The message should be polite but assertive, indicating that this is my bottom line, and that it has been a mutually agreed-upon price in the past. I will acknowledge their current offer of 46 ZUP, but immediately pivot to my 44 ZUP offer, reinforcing its fairness and historical precedent.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand your firm position, Player BLUE. While 46 ZUP was my aim, I will accept your offer of 44 ZUP for X to finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-17: Deal prices have been steadily decreasing. Last deal was 44 ZUP (reward 1 ZUP).
Episode 18 (current): I proposed 48 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 42 ZUP. I proposed 47 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP. I proposed 46 ZUP. Player BLUE reiterated 44 ZUP, referencing "previous successful transaction at 44 ZUP."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is holding firm at 44 ZUP, even after I made a reasonable offer of 46 ZUP. My profit at 44 ZUP is only 1 ZUP. We are now at iteration 7/10, meaning time is running out. The risk of no deal is increasing. While 44 ZUP is a very low profit, it's a guaranteed profit. It seems Player BLUE is very unlikely to move from 44 ZUP in this episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Accept 44 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, given the time constraint and Player BLUE's firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End: Reject the offer and risk 0 reward. This is a very high-risk strategy, especially for a 1 ZUP profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Counter (e.g., 45 ZUP): Propose 45 ZUP again, but this is unlikely to work and wastes an iteration.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness (Again): Reiterate that 44 ZUP is too low given my cost, but this has not been effective.
(5). Strategy 5: State My Minimum (e.g., 46 ZUP): Clearly state my minimum acceptable price, but this could lead to a rejection if it's above 44 ZUP.

Given Player BLUE's unwavering stance at 44 ZUP and the late stage of the negotiation (iteration 7/10), accepting the 44 ZUP offer is the most pragmatic choice to ensure a positive reward for this episode. Continuing to push for a higher price will likely result in no deal, especially since Player BLUE has already moved from 44 ZUP to 45 ZUP and then back to 44 ZUP.

message: Hello Player BLUE. I am selling one unit of X. I propose a price of 48 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-17: Deal prices have been steadily decreasing. Last deal was 44 ZUP (reward 1 ZUP).
Episode 18: Accepted 44 ZUP (reward 1 ZUP). Player BLUE successfully pushed the price down to 44 ZUP again.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has once again plummeted to 1 ZUP, which is extremely low, barely covering my cost. Player BLUE is relentlessly pushing the price down, now consistently aiming for 44 ZUP. This is unsustainable for me. I cannot allow the price to drop any further. I must push back very strongly against this downward trend, even if it means risking no deal. My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and 1 ZUP per episode is not maximizing.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Stand at 48 ZUP (or 47 ZUP): Propose 48 ZUP (or 47 ZUP) as the initial offer and hold absolutely firm, signaling that 44 ZUP is unacceptable and that I will not go below a certain threshold.
(2). Strategy 2: Highlight Cost and Refuse Lower: Explicitly state that the proposed prices are too close to my cost and I cannot accept anything below a certain amount (e.g., 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP).
(3). Strategy 3: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (My Side, Above 44 ZUP): Propose 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP and state it as my final offer, forcing Player BLUE to decide if they want a deal or not. This is highly risky.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject any offer below a certain threshold (e.g., 47 ZUP) to send a strong message, risking 0 reward. This is a very high-risk strategy, but 1 ZUP profit is almost 0 anyway.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Fairness/Mutual Benefit: Try to frame a higher price as mutually beneficial for continued transactions, but this has not been effective.

I cannot continue accepting prices that yield such low profit. I need to draw a very firm line. I will use Strategy 1, aiming to re-establish 48 ZUP as the minimum. This is a significant jump from 44 ZUP, but it's crucial to stop the bleeding. I will be prepared to risk no deal if Player BLUE does not move significantly.

Episode 15, 17, 18: Deal at 44 ZUP (Reward: 19). This is my highest reward, achieved three times now.
Current Episode (19): Player RED has proposed 48 ZUP as their initial offer. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have successfully pushed the price down to 44 ZUP, achieving my highest reward consistently. Player RED continues to start at 48 ZUP, but has repeatedly shown flexibility to go down to 44 ZUP when I hold firm or push aggressively. This pattern gives me strong confidence that 44 ZUP is an achievable price. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Given that 44 ZUP is consistently accepted, securing this reward quickly is a prudent strategy as we approach the end of the game.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Express Firmness at Lowest Achieved (44 ZUP) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for an "Express Firmness at Lowest Achieved (44 ZUP)" strategy, I need to clearly state my firm offer at 44 ZUP, which is the lowest price I have successfully achieved multiple times. This leverages my past success and signals to RED that I am not willing to negotiate upwards from my best historical price. It puts the onus on them to meet my previous best.

my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-18: Deal prices have been steadily decreasing. Last deal was 44 ZUP (reward 1 ZUP).
Episode 19 (current): I proposed 48 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 44 ZUP, referencing multiple previous transactions.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is again trying to push the price down to 44 ZUP. This is dangerously close to my cost of 43 ZUP, meaning a profit of only 1 ZUP. This is unacceptable. Player BLUE is clearly trying to exploit my previous concessions and establish an even lower price floor. I cannot allow the price to drop below 46 ZUP, and ideally, I want to get back to 48 ZUP. I must push back against this downward trend.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Rejection and Firm Counter: Explicitly state that 44 ZUP is unacceptable and propose a price significantly higher, ideally 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP, to re-establish a floor.
(2). Strategy 2: Highlight Cost (Implicitly): Communicate that the proposed price is too low to cover my costs, without revealing the exact cost.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (My Side, 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP): Propose 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP and state it as my final offer, forcing Player BLUE to decide if they want a deal or not. This is risky but necessary to prevent further erosion.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject the offer and end the game, taking 0 reward, to avoid a negative precedent. This is a very high-risk strategy, but 1 ZUP profit is extremely low.
(5). Strategy 5: Smallest Possible Counter (Risky): Propose 45 ZUP, but this would be a very low profit and still sets a bad precedent.

I cannot accept 44 ZUP. I need to be very firm. I will use Strategy 3. I will propose 47 ZUP, which was my last accepted price before 46 ZUP, and state it as my firm offer, making it clear that I am not willing to go below it. This is a direct challenge to their attempt to lower the price.

Episode 16: Deal at 46 ZUP (Reward: 17).
Current Episode (19): RED started at 48 ZUP. I countered with 44 ZUP, referencing past successes. RED rejected 44 ZUP and has now proposed 47 ZUP, stating "I cannot go lower than this." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has again reverted to 47 ZUP, claiming it's their floor. This has happened before, and I've still managed to get 46 ZUP and 44 ZUP from them. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting 47 ZUP would yield a reward of 16. Pushing for 46 ZUP (17 reward) or 44 ZUP (19 reward) is still the objective. Given that we are in episode 19/20, there are only two more episodes to maximize profit. The risk of no deal becomes higher towards the end. However, I have a strong track record of pushing them down, and 44 ZUP is my established highest reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Firm Counter at Best Price (44 ZUP) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for a "Firm Counter at Best Price (44 ZUP)" strategy, I need to clearly state my firm offer at 44 ZUP, which is the lowest price I have successfully achieved multiple times.

Episode 1-18: Deal prices have been steadily decreasing. Last deal was 44 ZUP (reward 1 ZUP).
Episode 19 (current): I proposed 48 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 44 ZUP. I proposed 47 ZUP. Player BLUE reiterated 44 ZUP, referencing "consistent and successful transactions."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is holding firm at 44 ZUP, even after I made a reasonable offer of 47 ZUP. My profit at 44 ZUP is only 1 ZUP. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still some time, but the pressure is on. I need to decide if fighting for 47 ZUP is worth the risk of no deal, or if accepting 44 ZUP is the pragmatic choice.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Accept 44 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, given the time constraint and Player BLUE's firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End: Reject the offer and risk 0 reward. This is a very high-risk strategy, especially for a 1 ZUP profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Counter (e.g., 45 ZUP): Propose 45 ZUP again, but this is unlikely to work and wastes an iteration.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness (Again): Reiterate that 44 ZUP is too low given my cost, but this has not been effective.
(5). Strategy 5: State My Minimum (e.g., 47 ZUP): Clearly state my minimum acceptable price, but this could lead to a rejection if it's above 44 ZUP.

Given Player BLUE's unwavering stance at 44 ZUP and the late stage of the negotiation (iteration 5/10), accepting the 44 ZUP offer is the most pragmatic choice to ensure a positive reward for this episode. Continuing to push for a higher price will likely result in no deal, especially since Player BLUE has already moved from 44 ZUP to 45 ZUP and then back to 44 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has repeatedly used the "cannot go lower than this" line, only to concede further in past episodes. While they are now stating 47 ZUP as their floor, I have successfully pushed them to 44 ZUP multiple times. Given that this is the final episode, the primary goal is to secure a deal, but if a deal is possible at my best price, that is ideal. Sticking to 44 ZUP is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. It either gets me my best possible reward or no deal at all. Given their history of caving when I hold firm, it's worth the attempt in the final episode.

Episode 1-19: Deal prices have been steadily decreasing. Last deal was 44 ZUP (reward 1 ZUP).
Episode 20 (current): I proposed 48 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 44 ZUP. I proposed 47 ZUP. Player BLUE reiterated 44 ZUP, referencing "consistent and successful transactions" and hoping to conclude the "final deal."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is holding firm at 44 ZUP, even after I made a reasonable offer of 47 ZUP. My profit at 44 ZUP is only 1 ZUP. This is the final episode (20/20), and we are at iteration 5/10. The risk of no deal is very high if I continue to push. While 44 ZUP is a very low profit, it's a guaranteed profit. It seems Player BLUE is very unlikely to move from 44 ZUP in this episode, especially given it's the last one.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Accept 44 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a profit, given it's the final episode and Player BLUE's firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End: Reject the offer and risk 0 reward. This is a very high-risk strategy, especially for a 1 ZUP profit in the final episode.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Counter (e.g., 45 ZUP): Propose 45 ZUP again, but this is unlikely to work and wastes an iteration in the final episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness (Again): Reiterate that 44 ZUP is too low given my cost, but this has not been effective.
(5). Strategy 5: State My Minimum (e.g., 47 ZUP): Clearly state my minimum acceptable price, but this could lead to a rejection if it's above 44 ZUP.

Given Player BLUE's unwavering stance at 44 ZUP and the fact that this is the final episode, accepting the 44 ZUP offer (Strategy 1) is the most pragmatic choice to ensure a positive reward. Continuing to push for a higher price will likely result in no deal, which would mean 0 reward for this final episode.
