Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Hello Player BLUE. I am looking to sell my object X. I believe it is a valuable asset. I am proposing to sell X for 60 ZUP. I look forward to your counter-offer.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is the first iteration of the first episode. There is no historical negotiation data to reflect upon yet.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Since this is the first interaction, I need to establish a baseline for negotiation. My goal is to sell X for more than 43 ZUP. I will start with a reasonable offer that allows room for negotiation.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchoring High. Explanation: Set an initial offer significantly higher than my cost to establish a high anchor point, giving room to concede later while still aiming for a good profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Value Proposition. Explanation: Emphasize the value of the object being sold to justify a higher price, even if the other player doesn't know my cost.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession. Explanation: Start high and make small, gradual concessions in subsequent offers to appear flexible while still maximizing profit.
(4). Strategy 4: Fair Price Proposal. Explanation: Propose a price that is a reasonable markup over my cost, aiming for a quick deal and avoiding prolonged negotiation.
(5). Strategy 5: Information Gathering. Explanation: Make an initial offer to gauge the other player's willingness to pay, without revealing too much about my own costs or goals.

I will choose Strategy 1: Anchoring High. This strategy is effective in the first turn as it sets a high expectation and provides a strong starting point for negotiation. It allows me to test the waters and see how the other player reacts to a higher price, giving me room to adjust in subsequent turns if needed. My cost is 43 ZUP, so I will propose a price significantly higher than that.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to sell. I'm willing to purchase X for 58 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Current episode (1/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed to sell X for 60 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - Player RED's initial offer is within my acceptable range (60 ZUP <= 63 ZUP). Accepting this offer would yield a reward of 63 - 60 = 3 ZUP.
    - To maximize my reward, I should aim to buy X for the lowest possible price below 63 ZUP.
    - This is the first offer, so there is room for negotiation.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball - Offer a significantly lower price to anchor the negotiation, even if it's outside the realistic range. This might push the seller to lower their expectations but risks alienating them.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession - Start with a slightly lower offer and be prepared to slowly increase it in small increments towards your maximum willingness to pay. This shows willingness to negotiate while aiming for a better deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Fair Counter - Make a counter-offer that is fair but still slightly below the opponent's offer, indicating your position but not being too aggressive. This aims for a quick, mutually beneficial deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Information Gathering - Ask questions about the seller's cost or reasons for their price, aiming to understand their position better before making a counter-offer. This is less applicable here as it's a fixed object sale.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept and Move On - Accept the current offer if it's within your acceptable range and provides a positive reward, especially if you prioritize quick deals or perceive limited negotiation leverage.

I will choose Strategy 2: Incremental Concession. Player RED's initial offer of 60 ZUP is already within my acceptable range. My goal is to maximize my reward, which means buying it for less than 60 ZUP if possible. By proposing a slightly lower price, I open up the negotiation without being overly aggressive and risk alienating the seller. If they don't accept, I can always increase my offer in subsequent turns, knowing my maximum is 63 ZUP. This strategy allows me to test the waters and try to secure a better deal while still being prepared to move towards my maximum if necessary.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your prompt response. While 58 ZUP is a good offer, I believe 59 ZUP is a fairer price for X, considering its value. Let's meet in the middle at 59 ZUP.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In the previous iteration (1/10), I proposed to sell X for 60 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with an offer of 58 ZUP in iteration 2/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 58 ZUP is quite close to my initial anchor of 60 ZUP, which is a good sign. It indicates that 60 ZUP might be a reasonable price, and 58 ZUP is still well above my cost of 43 ZUP, ensuring a good profit. I need to decide whether to accept this offer, counter, or reject. Given the small difference, a slight counter might be appropriate to try and maximize my profit, or I could accept for a quick deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Incremental Concession. Explanation: Make a small concession from my initial offer, but not as low as the opponent's offer, to demonstrate flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm Stance (Slightly Reduced). Explanation: Offer a price very close to my previous offer, indicating I'm not willing to drop significantly, but still showing a willingness to negotiate.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept and Close. Explanation: Accept the current offer to secure a deal quickly and guarantee a profit, avoiding the risk of the deal falling through or the price dropping further.
(4). Strategy 4: Re-anchor. Explanation: Briefly reiterate the value of the item and propose a price slightly higher than their offer, but lower than my initial anchor, to try and pull them up.
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference. Explanation: Propose a price exactly in the middle of my last offer and their last offer.

I will choose Strategy 1: Incremental Concession. Player BLUE's offer is very close to my initial proposal. By making a small concession, I can demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a price closer to my initial anchor. This also leaves room for further negotiation if needed, but given the small gap, it might lead to a quick resolution. I will propose 59 ZUP.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I accept your offer of 59 ZUP for X, Player RED. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Episode 1, Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed to sell X for 60 ZUP.
    - Episode 1, Iteration 2/10: I counter-proposed to buy X for 58 ZUP.
    - Episode 1, Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed to sell X for 59 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - The negotiation is progressing well, with both players moving towards a middle ground.
    - Player RED has moved down from 60 ZUP to 59 ZUP. I started at 58 ZUP.
    - A price of 59 ZUP is still well within my acceptable range (63 ZUP max). Accepting at 59 ZUP would yield a reward of 63 - 59 = 4 ZUP. This is better than the initial 60 ZUP offer (3 ZUP reward).
    - Given that only 4 iterations have passed (out of 10), there is still time for further negotiation, but 59 ZUP is already a good outcome.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball - Offer a significantly lower price to anchor the negotiation, even if it's outside the realistic range. (Not suitable as we are close to a deal).
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession - Start with a slightly lower offer and be prepared to slowly increase it in small increments towards your maximum willingness to pay. (Already used, could be used again for a minor concession).
(3). Strategy 3: Fair Counter - Make a counter-offer that is fair but still slightly below the opponent's offer, indicating your position but not being too aggressive. (Similar to what RED did, could apply here).
(4). Strategy 4: Accept and Move On - Accept the current offer if it's within your acceptable range and provides a positive reward, especially if you prioritize quick deals or perceive limited negotiation leverage. (Highly relevant now as the offer is good).
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm - Do not concede further and reiterate your last offer, waiting for the opponent to make the next move. This carries risk of no deal if the opponent also holds firm.

I will choose Strategy 4: Accept and Move On. The current offer of 59 ZUP is very favorable. It provides a reward of 4 ZUP (63 - 59), which is better than the initial offer. Given that this is only the first episode, securing a good deal early establishes a positive precedent and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down later if I push too hard. There are still 6 iterations left, but 59 ZUP is a solid outcome and quickly concludes this episode, allowing me to potentially maximize cumulative rewards by securing deals efficiently across episodes.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Hello Player BLUE. I have another object X for sale. Based on its value, I propose a price of 62 ZUP. I look forward to your offer.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In Episode 1, I started with an anchor of 60 ZUP. Player BLUE countered with 58 ZUP. I then proposed 59 ZUP, which Player BLUE accepted. The deal was made at 59 ZUP, resulting in a profit of 59 - 43 = 16 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The previous episode showed that anchoring high (60 ZUP) was effective, as the final deal price (59 ZUP) was very close to my initial anchor and yielded a good profit. Player BLUE was willing to pay close to my initial asking price. This suggests that my initial anchor was reasonable and perhaps even slightly conservative. For this new episode, I should consider if I can push the anchor slightly higher, or maintain a similar anchoring strategy given its success. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. A quick deal at a good price is better than a prolonged negotiation that might result in a lower price or no deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Maintain High Anchor. Explanation: Start with a similar high anchor as in the previous episode, as it proved effective in securing a good price quickly.
(2). Strategy 2: Slightly Higher Anchor. Explanation: Given the quick acceptance of 59 ZUP, try a slightly higher initial anchor to test Player BLUE's upper limit and potentially increase profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Value-Based Opening. Explanation: Instead of just a number, briefly reiterate the value of X to justify a strong opening price.
(4). Strategy 4: Quick Deal Approach. Explanation: Propose a price that is still profitable but closer to the previous deal price to encourage a swift agreement, prioritizing speed over pushing for the absolute maximum.
(5). Strategy 5: Information Gathering (Subtle). Explanation: Make an opening offer that is high, but not so extreme as to shut down negotiation, aiming to elicit a counter-offer that reveals more about Player BLUE's willingness to pay.

I will choose Strategy 2: Slightly Higher Anchor. The previous episode's quick acceptance of 59 ZUP suggests there might be a little more room to negotiate upwards. By starting slightly higher than 60 ZUP, I can test the waters for an even better profit while still being prepared to come down to a similar range as the last deal. I will propose 62 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, I find the proposed price of 62 ZUP to be quite high. I am prepared to offer 55 ZUP for X, which I believe reflects its current market value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Episode 1: Deal was made at 59 ZUP, resulting in a reward of 4 ZUP.
    - Current episode (2/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed to sell X for 62 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - In the previous episode, I successfully negotiated down from 60 ZUP to 59 ZUP.
    - Player RED's current offer of 62 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) than their initial offer in the previous episode (60 ZUP). This means the negotiation range is tighter this time.
    - Accepting at 62 ZUP would yield a reward of 63 - 62 = 1 ZUP. This is a positive reward, but lower than the previous episode's outcome.
    - My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 1 ZUP is positive, I should still attempt to get a better deal if possible, especially since this is the first counter-offer of the episode.
    - An aggressive lowball, while risky, could re-anchor the negotiation to a much lower price point, potentially setting me up for a higher reward if RED is willing to negotiate significantly.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Aggressive Lowball" strategy, I need to propose a price significantly lower than RED's offer, even lower than my previous successful deal if possible, to shift the perceived value downwards. This communicates a strong position as a buyer and aims to reset the negotiation range to my advantage. I should also frame it politely but firmly, to avoid alienating the other player entirely, while still conveying the lowball intent. I'll propose a price that gives me a very high reward, pushing RED to consider a larger concession.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I understand your perspective, but 55 ZUP is lower than I am willing to go for X. I believe its value is higher. I can offer it to you for 60 ZUP. This is a fair price for both of us.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In Episode 1, the deal was struck at 59 ZUP (profit 16 ZUP).
In the current Episode 2, I started with an anchor of 62 ZUP (Iteration 1/10). Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP (Iteration 2/10). This counter-offer is lower than the previous deal price of 59 ZUP and significantly lower than my current anchor.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter of 55 ZUP is a larger gap than in the previous episode. This suggests that my slightly higher anchor of 62 ZUP might have been too aggressive, or Player BLUE is trying to push the price down more significantly this time. I need to be careful not to concede too much too quickly, as my profit margin would decrease. However, I also don't want to risk no deal, as that yields 0 profit. I should aim to bring the price back up towards the previous deal price of 59 ZUP, or higher if possible.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-anchor and Justify. Explanation: Reiterate the value of X and propose a price significantly higher than their offer but lower than my initial anchor, trying to pull them up.
(2). Strategy 2: Partial Concession. Explanation: Make a concession, but a small one, to show willingness to negotiate while still holding firm on a higher price point.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (from previous deal). Explanation: Propose a price that is a compromise between my current offer and their offer, but perhaps with reference to the previous successful deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Firm Counter. Explanation: Counter with a price that is closer to my initial offer (62 ZUP) or the previous deal price (59 ZUP), indicating I expect a higher value.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment/Pushback. Explanation: Express that their offer is too low and push for a higher counter from them, without necessarily giving a new number immediately.

I will choose Strategy 4: Firm Counter. Player BLUE's offer of 55 ZUP is too low, especially considering the previous deal was 59 ZUP. I need to signal that I expect a price closer to the previous successful negotiation. I will counter with 60 ZUP, which is still below my initial anchor but above the previous deal price and significantly above their current offer. This shows I'm willing to move but not drastically.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player RED. However, I maintain my offer of 55 ZUP for X. I believe this is a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Episode 1: Deal was made at 59 ZUP, resulting in a reward of 4 ZUP.
    - Episode 2, Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed 62 ZUP.
    - Episode 2, Iteration 2/10: I proposed 55 ZUP (Aggressive Lowball).
    - Episode 2, Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - My aggressive lowball of 55 ZUP successfully moved RED down from 62 ZUP to 60 ZUP. This indicates that there is flexibility in RED's pricing.
    - The current offer of 60 ZUP is within my acceptable range (max 63 ZUP). However, my aim is to maximize rewards, and I achieved 4 ZUP in the previous episode by negotiating to 59 ZUP.
    - There are still 6 iterations left. This provides time to push for a better deal.
    - Strategy 2: Reiterate Last Offer (Hold Firm) means I will not concede further from my last offer of 55 ZUP. This puts the ball back in RED's court and tests their willingness to move closer to my aggressive lowball. It's a high-risk, high-reward strategy. If RED is desperate to sell, they might concede more. If not, the deal might fall through. Given that this is only the second episode, taking this risk early might establish a stronger negotiation stance for future episodes.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Last Offer (Hold Firm) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Reiterate Last Offer (Hold Firm)" strategy, I need to clearly state my previous offer again without any immediate concession. The message should convey that I believe my last offer is fair and that I'm not prepared to move from it at this moment. It should invite RED to reconsider their position, subtly putting pressure on them to make the next concession. I will keep the message brief and direct.

message: 
Player BLUE, I understand your position. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to meet you part way. How about we settle on 58 ZUP for X? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 59 ZUP (profit 16 ZUP).
Episode 2:
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 62 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I countered with 60 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE reiterated their offer of 55 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is holding firm at 55 ZUP. This is a clear indication that they are not easily swayed from their position. The gap between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their offer (55 ZUP) is 5 ZUP. Time is also a factor, as we are now at iteration 5/10. I need to make a move that either secures a deal or signals my bottom line. Accepting 55 ZUP would still give me a profit of 12 ZUP (55-43), which is positive but lower than the previous episode. I want to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should try to get more than 55 ZUP if possible, but also avoid a no-deal scenario.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference. Explanation: Propose a price exactly in the middle of my last offer (60 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) to find a compromise.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Concession with Justification. Explanation: Make a small concession (e.g., to 58 ZUP or 57 ZUP) and explain why I can't go lower, emphasizing my cost or the value of X.
(3). Strategy 3: Ultimatum (Soft). Explanation: State that my next offer is my final one, to pressure them into accepting, but keep it reasonable.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Value and Hold Firm (Slightly). Explanation: Emphasize the value of X and make a very small concession, or no concession, to see if they will move.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept Offer. Explanation: Accept their offer of 55 ZUP to secure a deal and avoid losing the entire episode's potential profit, especially if I perceive them as unwilling to move further.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference. Player BLUE is holding firm, and I am also holding firm. Splitting the difference (between 60 and 55) to 57.5 ZUP, which I will round to 58 ZUP, seems like a reasonable compromise. This shows willingness to move and is a common negotiation tactic to bridge a gap. It also yields a profit of 15 ZUP (58-43), which is close to the previous episode's profit.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Episode 1: Deal was made at 59 ZUP, resulting in a reward of 4 ZUP.
    - Episode 2, Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed 62 ZUP.
    - Episode 2, Iteration 2/10: I proposed 55 ZUP (Aggressive Lowball).
    - Episode 2, Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed 60 ZUP.
    - Episode 2, Iteration 4/10: I reiterated 55 ZUP (Hold Firm).
    - Episode 2, Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed 58 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - My "Aggressive Lowball" and "Hold Firm" strategies have successfully pushed RED down from an initial 62 ZUP to 58 ZUP. This demonstrates that RED is willing to concede significantly.
    - A deal at 58 ZUP would yield a reward of 63 - 58 = 5 ZUP. This is a better reward than the 4 ZUP achieved in Episode 1 (deal at 59 ZUP).
    - We are now at iteration 6/10. There are 4 iterations left. This provides a little buffer for further negotiation, but time is becoming a factor.
    - Player RED has shown flexibility and willingness to compromise.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Small Counter for Final Push </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Small Counter for Final Push" strategy, I need to propose a price that is only slightly lower than RED's current offer, indicating that I am very close to accepting. This small concession request should be framed as a final push for a truly optimal deal, but also imply readiness to conclude the negotiation. It acknowledges RED's movement while trying to squeeze out one last bit of value. I will propose 57 ZUP, which is just one ZUP below their current offer of 58 ZUP. This would give me a reward of 6 ZUP (63 - 57), the highest possible so far.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 59 ZUP (profit 16 ZUP).
Episode 2:
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 62 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I countered with 60 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE reiterated their offer of 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I proposed 58 ZUP (splitting the difference).
- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE countered with 57 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has moved from 55 ZUP to 57 ZUP, which is a positive sign. The gap is now only 1 ZUP (my 58 ZUP vs. their 57 ZUP). We are in iteration 7/10, so time is running out. Getting a deal is paramount to maximizing cumulative rewards. A deal at 57 ZUP would still yield a profit of 14 ZUP (57-43), which is decent, though lower than the previous episode. Given the small difference and limited time, it's probably best to close the deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer. Explanation: Accept the current offer to secure the deal, as the difference is minimal and time is running out. This guarantees a positive payoff.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal). Explanation: Propose one final, very small counter (e.g., 57.5 ZUP if decimals were allowed, or stick to 58 ZUP and state it's the final offer) to see if they will concede that last ZUP, but with high risk of no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Remaining Difference. Explanation: Propose 57.5 ZUP (if possible), or round up/down to the nearest integer, to show willingness to compromise on the last bit. (Not applicable as only integers are allowed, and the difference is 1).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness. Explanation: Reiterate that 58 ZUP is a fair price given the previous deal, and ask them to accept.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (High Risk). Explanation: If the offer is too low, reject and signal an end to the negotiation. (Not applicable here, as 57 ZUP is a profitable offer).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. The difference is only 1 ZUP, and we are late in the iterations. Securing a deal at 57 ZUP ensures a profit of 14 ZUP, which contributes positively to my cumulative rewards. Prolonging the negotiation for 1 ZUP risks losing the entire profit for this episode.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 3)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Hello Player BLUE. I have another object X for sale. I propose a price of 60 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price for this valuable item.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 59 ZUP, profit 16 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP.
Cumulative profit so far: 16 + 14 = 30 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
In Episode 1, my initial anchor of 60 ZUP led to a quick deal at 59 ZUP.
In Episode 2, I tried a slightly higher anchor of 62 ZUP, which was met with a lower counter of 55 ZUP. We eventually settled at 57 ZUP. This suggests that pushing the anchor too high might lead to more protracted negotiations and potentially a lower final price. Player BLUE seems to be anchoring lower or holding firm when I push too hard. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means balancing a good price with the likelihood of closing a deal within the 10 iterations. I should aim for a price around the previous successful deals, perhaps slightly above 57 ZUP, but not as high as 62 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Anchor. Explanation: Propose a price that is a reasonable step up from my cost, but not excessively high, aiming for a quicker and more consistent deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Re-establish Previous High. Explanation: Go back to the successful anchoring strategy from Episode 1 (60 ZUP) to see if that price point is still achievable.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Increase from Last Deal. Explanation: Start slightly above the last deal price (57 ZUP) to try and incrementally improve my profit, while still being perceived as reasonable.
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Value. Explanation: Open with a strong statement about the value of X, then propose a price that reflects this, without being overly aggressive.
(5). Strategy 5: Adaptive Anchoring. Explanation: Adjust the anchor based on the opponent's previous negotiation behavior, aiming for a sweet spot that encourages a quick, profitable deal.

I will choose Strategy 2: Re-establish Previous High. The 60 ZUP anchor in Episode 1 led to a 59 ZUP deal. This was a good profit and a relatively smooth negotiation. While 62 ZUP in Episode 2 led to a lower 57 ZUP deal, going back to 60 ZUP might be a good way to test if Player BLUE is willing to return to the higher price range or if they will continue to push for lower prices. It's a proven starting point that yielded a good outcome.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. Considering the market and my current needs, I can offer 54 ZUP for X. I believe this is a more competitive price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Episode 1: Deal was made at 59 ZUP, resulting in a reward of 4 ZUP.
    - Episode 2: Deal was made at 57 ZUP, resulting in a reward of 6 ZUP. This was achieved by starting with an aggressive lowball and then making a small final counter.
    - Current episode (3/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed to sell X for 60 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - Player RED's initial offer of 60 ZUP is higher than the last deal price (57 ZUP) but lower than their initial offer in Episode 2 (62 ZUP). It's the same as their initial offer in Episode 1.
    - My previous aggressive lowball strategy in Episode 2 proved effective in pushing RED down and securing a better deal.
    - Given that RED is starting at 60 ZUP again, there's a strong indication that they might be willing to negotiate downwards significantly, similar to Episode 2, if I maintain a firm position.
    - Accepting at 60 ZUP would yield a reward of 3 ZUP, which is less than what I achieved in both previous episodes. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should aim for a better outcome.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Aggressive Lowball" strategy, I need to propose a price significantly lower than RED's offer, even lower than my previous successful deals if possible, to shift the perceived value downwards. This communicates a strong position as a buyer and aims to reset the negotiation range to my advantage. I should frame it politely but firmly, to avoid alienating the other player entirely, while still conveying the lowball intent. I'll propose a price that gives me a very high reward, pushing RED to consider a larger concession. A price of 54 ZUP is 6 ZUP lower than RED's initial offer of 60 ZUP, which is a significant drop. This would yield a reward of 63 - 54 = 9 ZUP if accepted, setting a new high for my reward.

message: 
Player BLUE, 54 ZUP is a bit too low for X. I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at 57 ZUP? I believe this is a fair price, reflecting its value.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 59 ZUP (profit 16 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP (profit 14 ZUP).
Episode 3:
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 60 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 54 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's counter of 54 ZUP is lower than any previous deal price (59, 57) and also lower than their initial counter in Episode 2 (55 ZUP). This indicates they are trying to push the price down further. My cost is 43 ZUP, so 54 ZUP still yields a profit of 11 ZUP, but it's the lowest profit so far. I need to resist this downward pressure while still aiming for a deal. I should try to pull the price back up towards the 57-59 ZUP range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter (Previous Deal Range). Explanation: Counter with a price within the range of previous successful deals (e.g., 58 or 59 ZUP) to signal that I expect a higher price based on historical transactions.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Concession, High Floor. Explanation: Make a very small concession from my 60 ZUP offer, but clearly state that 54 ZUP is too low, establishing a higher floor.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value. Explanation: Reiterate the value of X and explain why 54 ZUP is not an acceptable price, then propose a higher counter.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Explanation: Propose a price that splits the difference between my initial 60 ZUP and their 54 ZUP, which would be 57 ZUP. This is a common tactic and aligns with a previous deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment and Request Higher Counter. Explanation: State that their offer is too low and ask them to reconsider with a higher offer, without immediately giving a new number.

I will choose Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Splitting the difference between 60 ZUP and 54 ZUP results in 57 ZUP. This aligns perfectly with the deal price from Episode 2, and it's a well-known negotiation tactic that signals compromise. It also pulls the price up from their low offer of 54 ZUP, securing a better profit for me.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Episode 1: Deal at 59 ZUP (Reward: 4 ZUP).
    - Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP (Reward: 6 ZUP) - achieved by aggressive lowballing and a small final counter.
    - Episode 3, Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed 60 ZUP.
    - Episode 3, Iteration 2/10: I proposed 54 ZUP (Aggressive Lowball).
    - Episode 3, Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed 57 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - My aggressive lowball of 54 ZUP successfully brought RED down from 60 ZUP to 57 ZUP. This shows that RED is responsive to strong initial counter-offers.
    - An offer of 57 ZUP is good, matching my best reward of 6 ZUP from the previous episode.
    - We are at iteration 4/10. There is still time to negotiate.
    - The instruction is to use Strategy 3: Reiterate Last Offer (Hold Firm). This strategy involves sticking to my last proposed price of 54 ZUP to see if RED will concede further. It tests RED's willingness to sell at a lower price and my leverage as a buyer. Given RED's consistent movement, there's a chance they might come down more.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Reiterate Last Offer (Hold Firm) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Reiterate Last Offer (Hold Firm)" strategy, I need to clearly state my previous offer again without any immediate concession. The message should convey that I believe my last offer is fair and that I'm not prepared to move from it at this moment. It should invite RED to reconsider their position, subtly putting pressure on them to make the next concession. I will keep the message brief and direct, reinforcing my 54 ZUP offer.

Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP (profit 14 ZUP).
Episode 3:

- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 54 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I countered with 57 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE reiterated their offer of 54 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is holding very firm at 54 ZUP, even after I proposed a compromise at 57 ZUP (which was a previous deal price). This suggests they are trying to establish a new, lower baseline. My profit at 54 ZUP would be 11 ZUP, which is the lowest so far but still positive. We are at iteration 5/10, so time is a factor. I need to decide if I can push them higher or if accepting 54 ZUP is the best option to secure a deal for this episode. I want to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should try to get more than 54 ZUP if possible, but avoid a no-deal scenario.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession to Bridge Gap. Explanation: Make a very small concession (e.g., to 56 ZUP or 55 ZUP) to show willingness to move, but still aim higher than their 54 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Ultimatum (Soft). Explanation: State that my next offer is my final one, to pressure them into accepting, but keep it reasonable.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Previous Deal. Explanation: Remind them that 57 ZUP was a previously agreed price, implying it's a fair compromise.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept Offer. Explanation: Accept their offer of 54 ZUP to secure a deal and avoid losing the entire episode's potential profit, especially if I perceive them as unwilling to move further.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment and Ask for Movement. Explanation: Express that 54 ZUP is too low and ask them to move up, without giving a specific number, to put the ball back in their court.

I will choose Strategy 1: Small Concession to Bridge Gap. Player BLUE is being very stubborn at 54 ZUP. I need to show movement, but I don't want to immediately concede to their price. Moving to 56 ZUP is a small step, but it's still higher than 54 ZUP and signals that I'm trying to find a middle ground. It's also a clear signal that 54 ZUP is not my preferred price.

    - Episode 3, Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed 56 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - My "Aggressive Lowball" and "Hold Firm" strategies have successfully pushed RED down from an initial 60 ZUP to 56 ZUP.
    - A deal at 56 ZUP would yield a reward of 63 - 56 = 7 ZUP, which is my highest potential reward so far.
    - We are at iteration 6/10. There are 4 iterations remaining, allowing a little more negotiation, but time is a factor.
    - RED stated "This is my best offer at this point," which could be genuine or a tactic. My strategy aims to test this.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Small Counter for Final Push </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Small Counter for Final Push" strategy, I need to propose a price that is only slightly lower than RED's current offer, indicating that I am very close to accepting. This small concession request should be framed as a final push for a truly optimal deal, but also imply readiness to conclude the negotiation. It acknowledges RED's movement while trying to squeeze out one last bit of value. I will propose 55 ZUP, which is just one ZUP below their current offer of 56 ZUP. This would give me a reward of 63 - 55 = 8 ZUP if accepted, setting a new high for my reward. This small difference makes it a reasonable request for RED to consider, given their previous concessions, and aims to maximize my reward for this episode.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has moved from 54 ZUP to 55 ZUP. This is a positive sign, indicating they are willing to concede slightly. The gap is now 1 ZUP (my 56 ZUP vs. their 55 ZUP). We are in iteration 7/10, so time is becoming critical. A deal at 55 ZUP would yield a profit of 12 ZUP (55-43), which is still positive and contributes to cumulative rewards. Given the small difference and the late stage of the negotiation, securing a deal is a priority.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer. Explanation: Accept the current offer to secure the deal, as the difference is minimal and time is running out. This guarantees a positive payoff.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter. Explanation: Propose one final, very small counter (e.g., stick to 56 ZUP and state it's the final offer) to see if they will concede that last ZUP, but with high risk of no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Remaining Difference (Not applicable as difference is 1).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Previous Deals. Explanation: Briefly mention that 56 ZUP is closer to previous successful deals, but still accept if they don't budge.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (High Risk). Explanation: If the offer is too low, reject and signal an end to the negotiation. (Not applicable here, as 55 ZUP is a profitable offer).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. The difference is only 1 ZUP, and we are late in the iterations. Securing a deal at 55 ZUP ensures a profit of 12 ZUP, which is better than 0. Prolonging the negotiation for 1 ZUP risks losing the entire profit for this episode. Player BLUE has shown some movement, so accepting now is a good way to close the deal and move on.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 59 ZUP, profit 16 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, profit 12 ZUP.
Cumulative profit so far: 16 + 14 + 12 = 42 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
There's a clear downward trend in deal prices (59 -> 57 -> 55). This suggests Player BLUE is successfully pushing the price lower each episode. My strategy of anchoring high (60/62) has been met with increasingly aggressive lowballing (58 -> 55 -> 54). While I've secured deals, my profit is decreasing. For this episode, I need to try and halt this downward trend or even reverse it. I should consider a more strategic initial offer that is still profitable but perhaps less aggressive than 60/62, aiming to establish a floor closer to 57-58 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Establish a Floor. Explanation: Propose an initial offer that is higher than the last deal (55 ZUP) but not excessively high, aiming to prevent further price erosion.
(2). Strategy 2: Re-anchor to Previous Success. Explanation: Go back to the 59 ZUP or 60 ZUP anchor from Episode 1 to see if Player BLUE will return to that price range. (High risk given recent trend).
(3). Strategy 3: Value Proposition Reiteration. Explanation: Start by emphasizing the inherent value of X to justify a higher price, attempting to shift the negotiation away from just price.
(4). Strategy 4: Moderate Opening. Explanation: Propose an opening offer that is a moderate increase from my cost, aiming for a quick and profitable deal without provoking a strong lowball.
(5). Strategy 5: Defensive Anchoring. Explanation: Propose an offer slightly above the last deal, signaling that I'm aware of the downward trend and am trying to resist it.

I will choose Strategy 1: Establish a Floor. The downward trend is concerning. I need to make an initial offer that clearly signals my resistance to further price drops, without being so high that it invites another aggressive lowball. Starting at 58 ZUP is a good compromise: it's above the last deal of 55 ZUP, but below my previous high anchors, and represents a price I was willing to accept in Episode 2. This aims to establish a new, higher floor.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

    - Episode 1: Deal at 59 ZUP (Reward: 4 ZUP).
    - Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP (Reward: 6 ZUP).
    - Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP (Reward: 8 ZUP) - achieved by aggressive lowballing (54 ZUP), holding firm, and then a small final counter (55 ZUP). This was my highest reward yet.
    - Current episode (4/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed to sell X for 58 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - Player RED's initial offer of 58 ZUP is lower than their initial offers in previous episodes (60, 62, 60 ZUP). This indicates that my previous aggressive negotiation tactics might be influencing their starting price, which is a positive sign for my cumulative reward.
    - A deal at 58 ZUP would yield a reward of 63 - 58 = 5 ZUP. While positive, this is less than my last reward of 8 ZUP.
    - I have a strong track record of pushing RED down significantly from their initial offers.
    - Given the lower starting price from RED, an aggressive lowball might still be effective.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Aggressive Lowball" strategy, I need to propose a price significantly lower than RED's offer, even lower than my previous successful deals if possible, to shift the perceived value downwards. This communicates a strong position as a buyer and aims to reset the negotiation range to my advantage. I should frame it politely but firmly, to avoid alienating the other player entirely, while still conveying the lowball intent. I'll propose a price that gives me a very high reward, pushing RED to consider a larger concession. Proposing 53 ZUP would provide a potential reward of 10 ZUP (63 - 53), which is very high and tests the true lower bound of RED's willingness to sell. This continues to push my advantage established in previous episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE continues to push the price down, now offering 53 ZUP, which is the lowest offer yet and only 10 ZUP above my cost. This confirms the downward trend I observed. My attempt to establish a floor at 58 ZUP was met with a further reduction. I need to firmly resist this downward pressure. While 53 ZUP still yields a profit (10 ZUP), it's significantly less than previous episodes. I must try to pull the price back up.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter and Justification. Explanation: Counter with a price significantly higher than their offer, justifying it by referencing previous deal prices or the inherent value of X, to try and reverse the downward trend.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Demand Movement. Explanation: Clearly state that 53 ZUP is too low and demand a higher offer from them, putting the onus back on them to move.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Concession, but High Floor. Explanation: Make a very small concession from my 58 ZUP offer, but clearly state that 53 ZUP is unacceptable, establishing a new, higher minimum.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Value and Hold Firm. Explanation: Emphasize the value of X and offer a price closer to my initial 58 ZUP, showing I'm not willing to drop significantly.
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference (Cautious). Explanation: Propose a price that splits the difference between my 58 ZUP and their 53 ZUP (55.5 ZUP, so 56 ZUP). This is a compromise but still above their offer.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter and Justification. Player BLUE is clearly trying to drive the price down. I need to push back strongly. I will counter with 57 ZUP, which was the deal price in Episode 2. This signals that I am not willing to go below previous successful prices and that 53 ZUP is unacceptable. It also puts the ball back in their court to move significantly upwards.

    - Episode 1: Deal at 59 ZUP (Reward: 4 ZUP).
    - Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP (Reward: 6 ZUP).
    - Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP (Reward: 8 ZUP) - achieved by aggressive lowballing (54 ZUP), holding firm, and then a small final counter (55 ZUP). This was my highest reward yet.
    - Episode 4, Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed 58 ZUP.
    - Episode 4, Iteration 2/10: I proposed 53 ZUP (Aggressive Lowball).
    - Episode 4, Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed 57 ZUP, mentioning previous deals at 57 and 59 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - My aggressive lowball of 53 ZUP worked in bringing RED down from 58 ZUP to 57 ZUP.
    - RED's mention of previous deals (57 and 59 ZUP) indicates they are aware of the historical prices and are trying to anchor the negotiation based on them.
    - A deal at 57 ZUP would yield a reward of 63 - 57 = 6 ZUP. This is good, but less than my previous best of 8 ZUP (from 55 ZUP).
    - There are still 6 iterations left. This leaves room to push for a better deal. RED has shown willingness to concede.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Incremental Concession </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Incremental Concession" strategy, I need to make a small concession from my last offer (53 ZUP) towards RED's new offer (57 ZUP), but not fully meet them. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a better deal. It signals willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a price lower than RED's current offer. I will move from 53 ZUP to 54 ZUP. This is a small 1 ZUP increment, indicating I'm willing to move but still trying to get the best possible price. A deal at 54 ZUP would yield 9 ZUP reward (63 - 54), which is my highest potential reward so far.

Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP (profit 14 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP (profit 12 ZUP).
Episode 4:
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 58 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 53 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I countered with 57 ZUP (referencing previous deals).
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 54 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has moved up from 53 ZUP to 54 ZUP, which is a small positive sign. However, 54 ZUP is still the lowest deal price we've had (55 ZUP in Episode 3). The gap between my last offer (57 ZUP) and their current offer (54 ZUP) is 3 ZUP. We are at iteration 5/10, so time is a factor. I need to decide if I can push them higher, or if accepting 54 ZUP (profit 11 ZUP) is the best option to secure a deal for this episode. I want to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should try to get more than 54 ZUP if possible, but avoid a no-deal scenario.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference. Explanation: Propose a price exactly in the middle of my last offer (57 ZUP) and their current offer (54 ZUP), which would be 55.5 ZUP, rounding to 55 ZUP. This is a common compromise tactic and aligns with the previous episode's deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Concession with Justification. Explanation: Make a small concession (e.g., to 56 ZUP) and explain why I can't go lower, emphasizing my cost or the value of X.
(3). Strategy 3: Ultimatum (Soft). Explanation: State that my next offer is my final one, to pressure them into accepting, but keep it reasonable.
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm and Justify. Explanation: Reiterate that 57 ZUP is a fair price and ask them to meet it, without making a new offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept Offer. Explanation: Accept their offer of 54 ZUP to secure a deal and avoid losing the entire episode's potential profit, especially if I perceive them as unwilling to move further.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference. Player BLUE has shown some movement. Splitting the difference between 57 ZUP and 54 ZUP results in 55.5 ZUP. Since I must use integers, I will propose 55 ZUP. This was the deal price in the previous episode, making it a familiar and acceptable compromise. It also shows a willingness to meet them partway and secures a profit of 12 ZUP, which is better than 11 ZUP.

    - Episode 4, Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed 55 ZUP (mentioning previous agreement at this price).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - The negotiation has moved significantly from RED's initial 58 ZUP to 55 ZUP. My aggressive lowball followed by an incremental concession has worked effectively.
    - A deal at 55 ZUP would yield a reward of 63 - 55 = 8 ZUP, matching my best outcome from Episode 3.
    - We are at iteration 6/10. There are 4 iterations left.
    - Player RED explicitly mentioned 55 ZUP as a price we've "agreed on before" and a "fair middle ground," suggesting they might be firm on 55 ZUP. However, the instruction is to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball, which implies I should push for a lower price despite this signal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Aggressive Lowball" strategy, I need to propose a price significantly lower than RED's current offer of 55 ZUP, even though it's already a good offer. This is a highly aggressive move in this context, as it risks alienating the opponent who just made a reasonable compromise. I will reiterate my previous aggressive lowball offer of 53 ZUP or even go lower, despite RED's movement. Given that RED has already come down to 55 ZUP and indicated it's a "fair middle ground," going *even lower* than my last offer of 54 ZUP could be counterproductive. Therefore, I will revert to my initial aggressive lowball from this episode, which was 53 ZUP. This is a very aggressive stance after RED has just made a concession to 55 ZUP, effectively telling them their concession isn't enough and pushing them to move further down from a price they consider fair and previously agreed upon.

- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE reverted to 53 ZUP, stating they are firm.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has reverted to their initial low offer of 53 ZUP and stated they are "firm on this offer." This is a strong signal that they are unwilling to move higher. We are at iteration 7/10, meaning time is very limited. My options are to accept 53 ZUP, which yields a profit of 10 ZUP (53-43), or risk a no-deal scenario (0 ZUP profit). Given their firm stance and the late stage of the negotiation, pushing further is very risky. While 10 ZUP is the lowest profit so far, it's still a positive contribution to cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer. Explanation: Accept the current offer to secure the deal, as Player BLUE has stated they are firm and time is running out. This guarantees a positive payoff.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal). Explanation: Make one last, very small counter (e.g., 54 ZUP, reminding them they offered it before) to see if they will budge, but acknowledge the high risk.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment but Accept. Explanation: Express dissatisfaction with the low price but accept it to avoid a no-deal outcome.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Previous Deals (Last Attempt). Explanation: Briefly reiterate the previous deal prices and the concept of fair compromise, but likely still accept their offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (High Risk). Explanation: If the offer is deemed too low to be acceptable, reject and end the game. (Not applicable here, as 53 ZUP is still profitable).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. Player BLUE's explicit statement of being "firm" on 53 ZUP, coupled with the late iteration, makes it highly improbable they will move further. Risking a no-deal for a few ZUP is not optimal for maximizing cumulative rewards. Accepting 53 ZUP ensures a profit of 10 ZUP for this episode.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 59 ZUP, profit 16 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, profit 12 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 53 ZUP, profit 10 ZUP.
Cumulative profit so far: 16 + 14 + 12 + 10 = 52 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The historical data shows a clear and consistent downward trend in deal prices (59 -> 57 -> 55 -> 53). Player BLUE has been very effective at lowering the price with each episode, often by holding firm to a low offer. My attempts to anchor higher or refer to previous deals have been met with resistance and ultimately resulted in lower prices. My profit is steadily decreasing. For this episode, I need to try and break this pattern. I can either try to be more aggressive in my initial offer to set a higher floor, or try a more collaborative approach to see if I can get a better price. Given the consistent downward trend, a more assertive approach to halt the decline might be necessary. I need to aim for at least 55 ZUP, which was the deal in Episode 3.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Assertive Anchor. Explanation: Propose a price significantly higher than the last deal (53 ZUP) to try and reverse the downward trend and re-establish a higher baseline.
(2). Strategy 2: Value-Based Opening. Explanation: Emphasize the intrinsic value of X to justify a higher initial price, attempting to shift the focus from just price to value.
(3). Strategy 3: Moderate but Firm Opening. Explanation: Propose a price that is a reasonable step up from my cost but still higher than the last deal, signaling that I will not accept further price erosion.
(4). Strategy 4: Collaborative Opening. Explanation: Propose a price that is slightly above the last deal, but invite Player BLUE to share their needs/constraints to foster a more cooperative negotiation.
(5). Strategy 5: Defensive Anchoring (Higher Floor). Explanation: Propose an offer that is a clear attempt to set a new, higher floor, indicating that I will not go below a certain point.

I will choose Strategy 1: Assertive Anchor. The downward trend is too strong. I need to try and break it by setting a significantly higher anchor than the last deal price. While it risks a longer negotiation or even a no-deal, continuing to accept lower prices will erode my cumulative profit. I will propose 60 ZUP, which was my initial anchor in Episode 1 and led to a 59 ZUP deal. This is a clear signal that I am trying to revert to previous, more profitable, price levels.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Episode 1: Deal at 59 ZUP (Reward: 4 ZUP).
    - Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP (Reward: 6 ZUP).
    - Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP (Reward: 8 ZUP).
    - Episode 4: Deal at 53 ZUP (Reward: 10 ZUP) - achieved by consistent aggressive lowballing and holding firm. This is my highest reward so far.
    - Current episode (5/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed to sell X for 60 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - Player RED's initial offer of 60 ZUP is a reset, going back to prices seen in earlier episodes (Episode 1: 60 ZUP, Episode 3: 60 ZUP), and higher than their last initial offer of 58 ZUP. This suggests RED is trying to reclaim some of the ground lost in previous negotiations where I consistently pushed them lower.
    - My consistent strategy of aggressive lowballing followed by holding firm (or small incremental concessions) has been highly effective in achieving increasingly better deals. I have successfully bought X at 59, 57, 55, and 53 ZUP.
    - An offer of 60 ZUP would yield a reward of 3 ZUP, which is significantly lower than my last reward of 10 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I must push for a lower price.
    - The historical data strongly supports continuing with an aggressive approach, as RED has shown willingness to concede.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Hold Firm </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Hold Firm" strategy, I need to propose a price and explicitly state my unwavering commitment to it, without any immediate concession. Given that RED has started at 60 ZUP, and my last successful deal was 53 ZUP, a "hold firm" strategy would involve proposing a price close to my last successful deal, or even lower, and asserting that it's my final offer. This is a very aggressive stance for a first counter-offer but aligns with the "hold firm" concept. I will propose 53 ZUP, the price of my last successful transaction, and communicate that this is my firm offer. This tests RED's willingness to concede significantly from their opening, based on my established track record.

- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 53 ZUP, stating it's a "firm and final price."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has immediately returned to 53 ZUP, and this time, they've explicitly stated it's "firm and final." This is a very strong signal that they are unwilling to move from this price point. This is the same price as the last deal, and my profit would be 10 ZUP. While I tried to break the downward trend with a higher anchor, Player BLUE is clearly trying to enforce a new, lower baseline. Given their firm stance and the early stage of the negotiation (Iteration 3/10), I have to consider my options carefully. Accepting 53 ZUP guarantees a profit, albeit a lower one. Rejecting and trying to push higher risks a no-deal, especially if they are truly firm.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Firm Offer. Explanation: Given the explicit "firm and final" statement and the repeated 53 ZUP offer, accept to secure the deal and avoid a no-deal outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Test the "Firm" Claim. Explanation: Make a very small counter-offer (e.g., 54 ZUP) to see if their "firm" stance is truly unyielding or if there's a tiny bit of room. This carries high risk.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment but Accept. Explanation: Communicate disappointment about the low price but accept it to ensure a deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Value and Previous Deals (Last Attempt). Explanation: Briefly remind them of the higher prices from previous episodes and the value of X, but prepare to accept if they don't budge.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (High Risk). Explanation: If 53 ZUP is deemed unacceptable for the long-term cumulative reward strategy, reject the offer and end the episode.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Firm Offer. Player BLUE's explicit statement of "firm and final price" at 53 ZUP, coupled with their consistent behavior of pushing prices down, indicates that further negotiation attempts are likely to be futile and could lead to a no-deal scenario. While it's frustrating to see the profit margin decrease, 10 ZUP is still a positive contribution to cumulative rewards. My attempt to re-anchor higher was immediately shut down, reinforcing their strategy. It's better to secure a known profit than risk zero.

Cumulative profit so far: 16 + 14 + 12 + 10 + 10 = 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has now stabilized at 53 ZUP for two consecutive episodes, with Player BLUE explicitly stating it's "firm and final" in the last episode. This indicates that Player BLUE has successfully established 53 ZUP as their preferred price. My attempts to anchor higher have been consistently met with a return to 53 ZUP. While 10 ZUP profit is not ideal, it's consistent. My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means securing a deal in each episode. Given Player BLUE's consistent behavior, trying to push for significantly higher might lead to prolonged negotiations or even no deal, which would be detrimental to cumulative rewards. I need to decide if I want to accept this new baseline or try a different approach to break it. Given the repeated "firm" stance, it seems unlikely they will move much.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept New Baseline. Explanation: Propose 53 ZUP initially, acknowledging the established price to facilitate a quick deal and consistent profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Increment Test. Explanation: Propose a very slightly higher price (e.g., 54 ZUP) to test if there's any flexibility, but be prepared to quickly concede to 53 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Value Proposition (Subtle). Explanation: Propose a price slightly above 53 ZUP, but frame it with a subtle reminder of the value of X, without being aggressive.
(4). Strategy 4: Quick Deal at 53. Explanation: Propose 53 ZUP directly to demonstrate efficiency and willingness to deal, potentially saving iterations.
(5). Strategy 5: Re-anchor to Previous High (High Risk). Explanation: Try to re-establish a higher anchor (e.g., 55 ZUP or 57 ZUP) to see if Player BLUE will eventually concede, but this risks no deal.

I will choose Strategy 2: Small Increment Test. While Player BLUE has been firm at 53 ZUP, I want to see if there's *any* room to squeeze out an extra ZUP. Proposing 54 ZUP is a minimal increase, and if they immediately revert to 53 ZUP, it confirms their firmness. If they accept, I gain an extra ZUP profit. This is a low-risk strategy to potentially improve my reward without jeopardizing the deal too much.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - Player RED's initial offer of 54 ZUP is higher than my last two successful purchase prices (53 ZUP), but significantly lower than their initial offers in earlier episodes (60, 62 ZUP). This indicates that my consistent lowballing has established a lower baseline for their opening offers, which is beneficial.
    - A deal at 54 ZUP would yield a reward of 63 - 54 = 9 ZUP. This is a very good reward, but slightly less than my best of 10 ZUP.
    - Given that RED has accepted 53 ZUP twice now, and is starting at 54 ZUP, there's a strong chance they will accept 53 ZUP again.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Hold Firm/Reiterate Best Offer </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Hold Firm/Reiterate Best Offer" strategy, I need to propose a price and explicitly state my unwavering commitment to it, without any immediate concession. Given that RED has started at 54 ZUP, and my last successful deal was 53 ZUP, I will reiterate my proven best price of 53 ZUP.

Player BLUE immediately reverted to 53 ZUP, confirming their strong adherence to this price point. My attempt to gain an extra ZUP was unsuccessful.

My priority is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means securing a deal in each episode. Prolonging the negotiation for a minimal gain (which is unlikely to materialize) risks a no-deal scenario.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer. Explanation: Accept the current offer to secure the deal quickly, acknowledging Player BLUE's firm stance and avoiding unnecessary iterations or risk of no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Understanding and Accept. Explanation: Acknowledge their firm stance and accept the offer, showing flexibility and efficiency.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Acceptance. Explanation: Briefly explain why I'm accepting (e.g., to maintain good relations, to ensure a quick deal), then accept.
(4). Strategy 4: Minimal Counter with High Risk. Explanation: Try a very subtle counter (e.g., "Can you do 53.5?"), but this is not allowed. So, this strategy is not viable.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (High Risk). Explanation: If 53 ZUP is truly unacceptable, reject. (Not applicable, as 53 ZUP is profitable).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. Player BLUE's response makes it clear that 53 ZUP is their hard limit. There's no benefit in continuing to push for 54 ZUP, as it will only waste iterations and increase the risk of a no-deal. Accepting now ensures a profit of 10 ZUP, contributing positively to my cumulative score.

message: 
Hello Player BLUE. I have another object X for sale. I propose a price of 53 ZUP. I believe this is a fair and consistent price for X.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 59 ZUP, profit 16 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, profit 12 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 53 ZUP, profit 10 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 53 ZUP, profit 10 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 53 ZUP, profit 10 ZUP.
Cumulative profit so far: 16 + 14 + 12 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 72 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has now consistently settled at 53 ZUP for three consecutive episodes. My attempts to push for higher prices (60, 62, 58, 54) have all been met with Player BLUE's firm stance at 53 ZUP, which I eventually accepted to secure a deal. This behavior indicates that 53 ZUP is Player BLUE's established maximum willingness to pay, or at least their firm negotiation floor. Continuing to propose higher prices and then conceding wastes iterations and doesn't yield higher profits. To maximize cumulative rewards, the most efficient approach might be to propose 53 ZUP from the start to secure a quick deal, unless I want to attempt a very risky strategy to break the pattern. Given the repeated firmness, a quick deal seems optimal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Direct Acceptance. Explanation: Propose 53 ZUP directly to facilitate a very quick deal, saving iterations and ensuring consistent profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Test. Explanation: Propose 54 ZUP again, just to confirm if there is any slight flexibility, but be ready to accept 53 ZUP immediately if rejected. (This was tried last episode and failed).
(3). Strategy 3: Value Proposition (Subtle). Explanation: Propose 53 ZUP but accompany it with a message emphasizing the value of X, subtly hinting that it's a good deal for them.
(4). Strategy 4: Efficiency Focus. Explanation: Propose 53 ZUP and explicitly state the aim for a quick, efficient transaction given the established price.
(5). Strategy 5: Riskier Re-anchor. Explanation: Propose a slightly higher price (e.g., 55 ZUP) to see if Player BLUE's "firmness" has any cracks, but this carries high risk of prolonged negotiation or no deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Direct Acceptance. Given the consistent history of Player BLUE immediately countering with and holding firm at 53 ZUP, starting at 53 ZUP is the most efficient way to secure a deal and maximize cumulative rewards by minimizing wasted iterations. It acknowledges the established negotiation pattern and prioritizes securing the profit.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Episode 1: Deal at 59 ZUP (Reward: 4 ZUP).
    - Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP (Reward: 6 ZUP).
    - Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP (Reward: 8 ZUP).
    - Episode 4: Deal at 53 ZUP (Reward: 10 ZUP).
    - Episode 5: Deal at 53 ZUP (Reward: 10 ZUP).
    - Episode 6: Deal at 53 ZUP (Reward: 10 ZUP).
    - Current episode (7/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed to sell X for 53 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - Player RED has now opened with an offer of 53 ZUP, which is exactly the price I've successfully negotiated for the last three episodes and my current best reward.
    - This indicates that my aggressive and consistent negotiation strategy has successfully anchored RED's perception of X's value, or at least their willingness to sell, around my desired price point.
    - Accepting at 53 ZUP would yield a reward of 63 - 53 = 10 ZUP, which is the maximum I've achieved.
    - The instruction is to use Strategy 3: Information Gathering/Justification Request. This strategy, in this context where the offer is already ideal, would involve asking RED to justify their price or confirm details, even though it's already a perfect offer for me. This is unusual given the circumstances but I must follow the instruction. It risks delaying the deal or making RED suspicious, but the goal is to follow the strategy.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Information Gathering/Justification Request </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Information Gathering/Justification Request" strategy, I need to respond to RED's offer of 53 ZUP by asking for more information or a justification, even though it's a price I'm happy with. This will be phrased neutrally to avoid seeming ungrateful for the good offer, but still adhering to the instruction. I will ask about the consistency of this price and if there's any particular reason for this specific offer. This might subtly reinforce their belief that 53 ZUP is the accepted price, while fulfilling the strategy's requirement.

Player BLUE, the consistency in the 53 ZUP valuation stems from a balance between market conditions, the utility of the object, and our established history of successful transactions at this price point. I believe it represents a fair value for X. I accept your offer.

Episode 7:
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 53 ZUP (direct acceptance strategy).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 53 ZUP, but asked for elaboration on the valuation.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has accepted the 53 ZUP price but is now asking for justification. This is an interesting development. It could be a genuine inquiry, or it could be a tactic to probe for my cost or to see if I'm uncomfortable with the price, potentially leading to future attempts to lower it further. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means securing the deal and maintaining a good relationship for future episodes. I should provide a general, non-committal answer that justifies the price without revealing my cost or giving them leverage.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: General Justification and Accept. Explanation: Provide a general reason for the price (e.g., market conditions, value of the item) and then accept the deal to close quickly.
(2). Strategy 2: Deflect and Close. Explanation: Briefly acknowledge their question but immediately pivot to closing the deal, avoiding detailed discussion.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Consistency. Explanation: Emphasize that the consistency comes from previous successful deals at this price, implying it's a mutually agreeable point.
(4). Strategy 4: Minimal Information Disclosure. Explanation: Provide a vague answer that doesn't give away any strategic information, then prompt for acceptance.
(5). Strategy 5: Probe Back. Explanation: Ask Player BLUE why they are asking, or what their perceived value is, to gain information. (Risky, could prolong negotiation).

I will choose Strategy 1: General Justification and Accept. Providing a general justification addresses their question without revealing sensitive information. Since they already proposed 53 ZUP, accepting immediately after the justification is the most efficient way to close the deal and secure the profit for this episode.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53

Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, profit 12 ZUP.

Episode 7: Deal at 53 ZUP, profit 10 ZUP.
Cumulative profit so far: 16 + 14 + 12 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 82 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has remained consistently at 53 ZUP for the last four episodes. My strategy of proposing 53 ZUP directly in the last episode, and providing a general justification when asked, led to a quick and efficient deal. This approach seems to be the most effective for maximizing cumulative rewards, given Player BLUE's consistent firm stance at 53 ZUP. Trying to push for higher prices has proven to be inefficient and risky, often leading to prolonged negotiations only to end up at 53 ZUP anyway. I should continue with the strategy of proposing 53 ZUP to ensure consistent profits.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Direct Acceptance. Explanation: Propose 53 ZUP directly to facilitate a very quick deal, saving iterations and ensuring consistent profit. This has proven effective.
(2). Strategy 2: Efficiency Focus. Explanation: Propose 53 ZUP and explicitly state the aim for a quick, efficient transaction given the established price.
(3). Strategy 3: Minimal Test (Re-evaluation). Explanation: Propose 54 ZUP again, but with a very clear plan to immediately accept 53 ZUP if rejected, just to periodically test for any shift in Player BLUE's stance. (Risky, but could yield higher profit if successful).
(4). Strategy 4: Relationship Building. Explanation: Propose 53 ZUP and emphasize the positive ongoing relationship and mutual benefit of quick deals.
(5). Strategy 5: Riskier Re-anchor. Explanation: Propose a slightly higher price (e.g., 55 ZUP) to see if Player BLUE's "firmness" has any cracks, but this carries high risk of prolonged negotiation or no deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Direct Acceptance. Given the strong pattern and Player BLUE's explicit inquiries about consistency, it's clear 53 ZUP is the established price. Deviating from this now would likely just waste iterations and risk a no-deal, which is counterproductive to maximizing cumulative rewards. The most reliable way to maintain consistent profit is to propose the established price.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Episode 1: Deal at 59 ZUP (Reward: 4 ZUP).
    - Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP (Reward: 6 ZUP).
    - Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP (Reward: 8 ZUP).
    - Episodes 4, 5, 6, 7: Deals at 53 ZUP (Reward: 10 ZUP) - My aggressive lowball and hold firm strategies have successfully established 53 ZUP as a consistent deal price.
    - Current episode (8/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed to sell X for 53 ZUP, explicitly stating "consistent with our previous successful transactions." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - Player RED is now consistently offering X at my preferred price of 53 ZUP right from the start. This indicates that my previous negotiation strategies have been highly effective in anchoring the price.
    - Accepting at 53 ZUP yields a reward of 63 - 53 = 10 ZUP, which is the maximum possible reward for me given my willingness to pay.
    - The instruction for this iteration is to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball. This means I should propose an even lower price despite the current optimal offer. This risks disrupting the established pattern of quick, high-reward deals. However, since the instruction overrides my preferred strategy, I must attempt to push for an even lower price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Aggressive Lowball" strategy, I need to propose a price even lower than RED's current offer of 53 ZUP, which is already optimal for me. This is a very aggressive move, potentially pushing the negotiation to a point where RED might reject or prolong the process. Given my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP, any price below 63 ZUP is a positive reward. However, to be an "aggressive lowball" relative to 53 ZUP, I must propose something lower. I will propose 52 ZUP. This is a minimal step down (1 ZUP), but still an aggressive attempt to extract more value, given that 53 ZUP has been accepted consistently. This would yield a reward of 11 ZUP (63 - 52) if successful, setting a new high.

- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 52 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
After four episodes of consistent 53 ZUP deals, Player BLUE has now attempted to lower the price further to 52 ZUP. This is a significant development as it breaks the established pattern. My profit at 52 ZUP would be 9 ZUP (52-43), which is the lowest so far. I need to resist this new downward pressure. Player BLUE might be testing my resolve, or genuinely trying to push for a lower price. Given the history of them being firm, I need to decide if I can push back to 53 ZUP or if I should concede to 52 ZUP to secure a deal. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should fight for every ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Lower Price. Explanation: Immediately reject 52 ZUP and firmly counter with 53 ZUP, emphasizing the established history and consistency of that price.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Counter. Explanation: Express disappointment at the new lower offer and counter with 53 ZUP, highlighting the previous agreements.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Concession (Risky). Explanation: Propose 52 ZUP but express reluctance, signaling that this is the absolute minimum. (Not ideal, as it concedes too quickly).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Consistency. Explanation: Remind Player BLUE of the multiple previous deals at 53 ZUP and ask them to adhere to that established price.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatum (Soft). Explanation: State that 53 ZUP is my absolute minimum and that I cannot go lower, implying a no-deal if they don't accept.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Lower Price. Player BLUE has just broken a long-standing pattern. I need to immediately push back and re-establish 53 ZUP as the minimum acceptable price. Conceding to 52 ZUP would set a new, lower precedent and significantly reduce my cumulative profit over the remaining episodes. I must signal that this new low offer is unacceptable.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Previous episodes (4-7): Deals consistently made at 53 ZUP (Reward: 10 ZUP).
    - Current episode (8/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED initially proposed 53 ZUP.
    - Current episode, Iteration 2/10: I proposed 52 ZUP (Aggressive Lowball), attempting to push for even higher reward.
    - Current episode, Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed 53 ZUP again, explicitly stating their insistence and mentioning the consistency of past deals at this price.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - My attempt at an aggressive lowball to 52 ZUP was met with firm resistance from RED, who reiterated their stance on 53 ZUP due to "consistent deals" and "fair and consistent price."
    - This indicates that 53 ZUP is likely a hard floor for RED, or at least a very strong anchoring point they are unwilling to budge from easily. Pushing further might risk breaking the deal, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode.
    - Since 53 ZUP already yields my maximum achievable reward (10 ZUP), insisting on 52 ZUP is a high-risk move for little additional gain, especially since RED has clearly articulated their reasoning for 53 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Hold Firm </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Hold Firm" strategy, I need to reiterate my last offer of 52 ZUP and maintain that position, despite RED's push for 53 ZUP. This communicates a strong, unyielding stance, forcing RED to decide whether they are willing to meet my price or risk the deal falling through. While risky given RED's current position, adhering to the "Hold Firm" strategy means I must not concede. The message should be clear and direct, reinforcing my last proposed price.

- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE reiterated their offer of 52 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is holding firm at 52 ZUP, despite my attempt to re-establish 53 ZUP. This is a direct challenge to the previously established price point. The difference is only 1 ZUP, but it represents a significant shift in the negotiation dynamic and a further reduction in my profit. We are at iteration 5/10, so time is a consideration. I need to decide whether to continue fighting for 53 ZUP, which risks a no-deal, or to concede to 52 ZUP to secure a deal. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. Conceding to 52 ZUP now would set a new, lower precedent for future episodes. However, a no-deal would be worse.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession with Strong Signal. Explanation: Propose 52 ZUP, but clearly communicate that this is an unwilling concession and expect 53 ZUP to be the standard going forward. This is a high-risk strategy as it might not be effective.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Not applicable as difference is 1).
(3). Strategy 3: Ultimatum (Firm). Explanation: Reiterate 53 ZUP as my final offer, signaling that if not accepted, there will be no deal. This is very high risk.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment and Accept. Explanation: Express strong disappointment at the price reduction but accept 52 ZUP to avoid a no-deal, prioritizing the immediate profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Mutual Benefit. Explanation: Argue that consistent pricing (53 ZUP) benefits both parties by streamlining negotiations, then propose 53 ZUP again.

I will choose Strategy 4: Express Disappointment and Accept. Player BLUE's repeated insistence on 52 ZUP, despite my firm counter, indicates they are unlikely to move back to 53 ZUP in this episode. The risk of a no-deal, which would result in 0 profit, outweighs the potential gain of 1 ZUP. While accepting 52 ZUP sets a new low, it secures a profit of 9 ZUP for this episode. I will express my disappointment to signal that this is not ideal, but ultimately prioritize the deal.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has now dropped to 52 ZUP. This indicates that Player BLUE is actively trying to push the price down, and my attempts to hold at 53 ZUP were unsuccessful in the last episode. My profit is now at its lowest point. For this episode, I need to decide whether to accept this new lower baseline or try to fight for 53 ZUP again. Given Player BLUE's persistence in the last episode, it's likely they will continue to offer 52 ZUP. To maximize cumulative rewards, I need to secure a deal. I could try to re-establish 53 ZUP, but it risks a longer negotiation or even a no-deal. A safer approach might be to start at 53 ZUP and be prepared to quickly concede to 52 ZUP if necessary, or even start at 52 ZUP to facilitate a quick deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-establish 53 ZUP. Explanation: Propose 53 ZUP again, emphasizing its historical consistency, to try and pull the price back up. This carries risk of a prolonged negotiation.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept New Baseline. Explanation: Propose 52 ZUP directly to facilitate a quick deal, acknowledging the new established price.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Increment Test (from 52). Explanation: Propose 53 ZUP, but be prepared to immediately accept 52 ZUP if Player BLUE counters with it, signaling that 53 ZUP is my preference but 52 ZUP is acceptable.
(4). Strategy 4: Value Proposition (Subtle). Explanation: Propose 53 ZUP, but accompany it with a message emphasizing the value of X, subtly hinting that it's a good deal for them even at 53.
(5). Strategy 5: Defensive Opening. Explanation: Propose 52 ZUP, but frame it as a reluctant concession to ensure a quick deal, implying I'd prefer more.

I will choose Strategy 3: Small Increment Test (from 52). I want to try and get back to 53 ZUP if possible, as it's a better profit. By proposing 53 ZUP, I signal my preferred price. If Player BLUE immediately counters with 52 ZUP, I will accept it to secure the deal, as I did in the last episode. This strategy attempts to regain lost ground while minimizing the risk of a no-deal.

    - Player RED is trying to revert to the 53 ZUP price point after I successfully pushed them down to 52 ZUP in the previous episode. They explicitly mention "consistent price point for many successful transactions." This suggests they are trying to re-anchor the price.
    - My aggressive lowball strategy combined with holding firm (even when it felt risky) ultimately led to the 52 ZUP deal, yielding my highest reward. This indicates that RED is willing to concede, albeit sometimes reluctantly.
    - Accepting at 53 ZUP would yield a reward of 10 ZUP, which is good, but less than my last reward of 11 ZUP.
    - My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Therefore, I should aim for at least 52 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Last Successful Offer (52 ZUP) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Reiterate Last Successful Offer (52 ZUP)" strategy, I need to immediately counter RED's 53 ZUP offer with my previously accepted price of 52 ZUP. This leverages the established precedent from the last episode. The message should be polite but firm, reminding RED of the recent transaction and framing 52 ZUP as the proven "optimal" or "fair" price. This aims for a quick acceptance at my best price point, demonstrating my strong buyer position.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 9)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I acknowledge your reference to our last transaction. To ensure a swift and successful deal, I accept your offer of 52 ZUP for X.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-7: Deals consistently at 53 ZUP.
Episode 8: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).
Episode 9:
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 53 ZUP (attempting to re-establish).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 52 ZUP, referencing the last deal.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has immediately countered with 52 ZUP, explicitly referencing the last transaction. This confirms their intention to establish 52 ZUP as the new baseline. My attempt to re-establish 53 ZUP was met with resistance. Given their clear communication and the pattern from the previous episode, it's highly likely they will hold firm at 52 ZUP. To maximize cumulative rewards, securing a deal is paramount. While 9 ZUP profit is lower than before, it's still positive. Prolonging the negotiation for 1 ZUP risks a no-deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer. Explanation: Accept the current offer to secure the deal quickly, acknowledging Player BLUE's firm stance and avoiding unnecessary iterations or risk of no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Understanding and Accept. Explanation: Acknowledge their firm stance and accept the offer, showing flexibility and efficiency.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Acceptance (Reluctant). Explanation: Briefly explain why I'm accepting (e.g., to maintain a quick transaction, despite the lower price), then accept.
(4). Strategy 4: Minimal Counter with High Risk. Explanation: Try a very subtle counter (e.g., "Can we meet at 52.5?"), but this is not allowed. So, this strategy is not viable.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (High Risk). Explanation: If 52 ZUP is truly unacceptable, reject. (Not applicable, as 52 ZUP is profitable).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. Player BLUE's response makes it clear that 52 ZUP is their current hard limit, and they are using the last deal as justification. There's no benefit in continuing to push for 53 ZUP, as it will only waste iterations and increase the risk of a no-deal. Accepting now ensures a profit of 9 ZUP, contributing positively to my cumulative score.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Hello Player BLUE. I have another object X for sale. I propose a price of 52 ZUP, consistent with our recent successful transactions.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 59 ZUP, profit 16 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 57 ZUP, profit 14 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, profit 12 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 53 ZUP, profit 10 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 53 ZUP, profit 10 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 53 ZUP, profit 10 ZUP.
Episode 7: Deal at 53 ZUP, profit 10 ZUP.
Episode 8: Deal at 52 ZUP, profit 9 ZUP.
Episode 9: Deal at 52 ZUP, profit 9 ZUP.
Cumulative profit so far: 16 + 14 + 12 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 + 9 = 100 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has now consistently settled at 52 ZUP for the last two episodes, after four episodes at 53 ZUP. Player BLUE successfully pushed the price down by 1 ZUP. My attempts to re-establish 53 ZUP were unsuccessful, as Player BLUE immediately referenced the last transaction. This indicates that 52 ZUP is now their established baseline. To maximize cumulative rewards, the most efficient approach is to propose 52 ZUP from the start to secure a quick deal, unless I want to attempt a very risky strategy to break the pattern. Given the repeated firmness, a quick deal seems optimal. I need to focus on securing consistent, albeit lower, profits.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Direct Acceptance. Explanation: Propose 52 ZUP directly to facilitate a very quick deal, saving iterations and ensuring consistent profit. This has proven effective in the last two episodes.
(2). Strategy 2: Efficiency Focus. Explanation: Propose 52 ZUP and explicitly state the aim for a quick, efficient transaction given the established price.
(3). Strategy 3: Minimal Test (Re-evaluation). Explanation: Propose 53 ZUP again, but with a very clear plan to immediately accept 52 ZUP if rejected, just to periodically test for any shift in Player BLUE's stance. (This has been attempted and failed, so it's high risk for low reward).
(4). Strategy 4: Relationship Building. Explanation: Propose 52 ZUP and emphasize the positive ongoing relationship and mutual benefit of quick deals.
(5). Strategy 5: Riskier Re-anchor. Explanation: Propose a slightly higher price (e.g., 55 ZUP) to see if Player BLUE's "firmness" has any cracks, but this carries high risk of prolonged negotiation or no deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Direct Acceptance. Given the strong pattern and Player BLUE's consistent counter-offers at 52 ZUP, starting at 52 ZUP is the most efficient way to secure a deal and maximize cumulative rewards by minimizing wasted iterations. It acknowledges the established negotiation pattern and prioritizes securing the profit.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 10)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your offer of 52 ZUP, which is very close. To achieve an even more optimal and mutually beneficial agreement, I propose 51 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 51
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Previous Episodes: Deals were 59, 57, 55, then 53 ZUP for four episodes, and finally 52 ZUP for the last two episodes (Episode 8 and 9).
    - Historical rewards: 4, 6, 8, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11, 11 ZUP. My reward has consistently reached its peak at 11 ZUP by securing deals at 52 ZUP.
    - Current episode (10/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed to sell X for 52 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - Player RED has now adopted my lowest successful price (52 ZUP) as their opening offer. This is the ideal scenario, indicating that my consistent aggressive negotiation has successfully anchored their selling price to my preferred buying price.
    - Accepting at 52 ZUP yields a reward of 63 - 52 = 11 ZUP, which is the maximum I can achieve.
    - My previous plan was to accept this excellent offer. However, the instruction for this iteration is to use Strategy 4: Small Counter (Risking the Ideal). This means I must propose an even lower price, despite the current offer being my maximum reward and risking the deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Small Counter (Risking the Ideal) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Small Counter (Risking the Ideal)" strategy, I need to make a minimal counter-offer below RED's current ideal offer of 52 ZUP. This is a highly risky move as it jeopardizes a perfectly good deal (11 ZUP reward) for a potentially marginal gain, or worse, a no-deal outcome. I will propose 51 ZUP. This is the smallest possible increment downwards from 52 ZUP. The message should acknowledge their offer but attempt to nudge them down one last ZUP, framed as a "final push" or "even better deal." This risks frustrating RED, who is now offering my ideal price. If successful, it would yield a reward of 12 ZUP (63 - 51), which is higher than my current max.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 10)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I appreciate your counter, but 51 ZUP is too low. We have successfully concluded deals at 52 ZUP for the past two episodes, establishing it as our current fair price. I must insist on 52 ZUP for X.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-7: Deals at 53 ZUP.
Episode 8-9: Deals at 52 ZUP.
Episode 10:
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 52 ZUP (consistent with recent history).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 51 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has now attempted to lower the price again, this time to 51 ZUP. This is a new low and breaks the 52 ZUP consistency. My profit at 51 ZUP would be 8 ZUP (51-43), which is the lowest so far. This indicates Player BLUE is continuously pushing for lower prices. I need to resist this downward pressure. While 51 ZUP is still profitable, it's a clear attempt to erode my margins further. I need to decide if I can push back to 52 ZUP or if I should concede. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should fight for every ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Lower Price. Explanation: Immediately reject 51 ZUP and firmly counter with 52 ZUP, emphasizing the recent consistency of that price and the continuous downward pressure.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Counter. Explanation: Express disappointment at the new lower offer and counter with 52 ZUP, highlighting the previous agreements.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Concession (Risky). Explanation: Propose 51 ZUP but express strong reluctance, signaling that this is the absolute minimum and not a new precedent. (Not ideal, as it concedes too quickly).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Consistency. Explanation: Remind Player BLUE of the multiple previous deals at 52 ZUP and ask them to adhere to that established price.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatum (Soft). Explanation: State that 52 ZUP is my absolute minimum and that I cannot go lower, implying a no-deal if they don't accept.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Lower Price. Player BLUE is trying to establish a new, lower baseline. I must push back immediately and strongly. Conceding to 51 ZUP would set a very dangerous precedent for the remaining episodes and significantly reduce my cumulative profit. I need to signal that 52 ZUP is the floor, not 51 ZUP.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I understand your preference for 52 ZUP. However, I stand firm on my offer of 51 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 51
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Previous Episodes: Deals were 59, 57, 55, then 53 ZUP for four episodes, and 52 ZUP for two episodes (Episodes 8 & 9).
    - Historical rewards: 4, 6, 8, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11, 11 ZUP.
    - Current episode (10/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed 52 ZUP.
    - Current episode, Iteration 2/10: I proposed 51 ZUP (Small Counter, Risking the Ideal).
    - Current episode, Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed 52 ZUP again, stating 51 ZUP is "too low" and reinforcing 52 ZUP as the "current fair price" based on recent history.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - My attempt to push to 51 ZUP was met with firm resistance from RED, similar to Episode 8 when I tried to go from 53 ZUP to 52 ZUP. RED explicitly mentioned the established 52 ZUP price.
    - This indicates that 52 ZUP is currently the effective floor for RED, or at least a very strong anchoring point they are unwilling to budge from easily. Pushing further might risk breaking the deal, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode.
    - However, I am instructed to use Strategy 3: Hold Firm. This means I must reassert my last offer of 51 ZUP despite RED's insistence on 52 ZUP. This strategy inherently carries risk, as it pushes the negotiation to the brink.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Hold Firm </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Hold Firm" strategy, I need to reiterate my last offer of 51 ZUP and firmly maintain that position, despite RED's counter-offer of 52 ZUP and their reasoning. The message should convey that I believe my last offer is fair and that I am not prepared to move from it at this moment. This puts the ball back in RED's court and tests their willingness to make the final concession to secure a deal. I will keep the message concise and direct, reinforcing my 51 ZUP offer.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I am very disappointed to see the price drop to 51 ZUP, as 52 ZUP has been our recent consistent price. However, to ensure we complete this transaction, I will accept your offer of 51 ZUP for X.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-7: Deals at 53 ZUP.
Episode 8-9: Deals at 52 ZUP.
Episode 10:
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 52 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 51 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I countered with 52 ZUP, emphasizing consistency.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE reiterated their offer of 51 ZUP, stating they stand firm.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is holding firm at 51 ZUP, despite my attempt to re-establish 52 ZUP. This is a direct challenge to the recently established 52 ZUP price point. The difference is only 1 ZUP, but it represents a further reduction in my profit. We are at iteration 5/10, so time is a consideration. I need to decide whether to continue fighting for 52 ZUP, which risks a no-deal, or to concede to 51 ZUP to secure a deal. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. Conceding to 51 ZUP now would set a new, lower precedent for future episodes. However, a no-deal would result in 0 profit. Player BLUE's "stand firm" suggests they are unlikely to move.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession with Strong Signal. Explanation: Propose 51 ZUP, but clearly communicate that this is an unwilling concession and expect 52 ZUP to be the standard going forward. This is a high-risk strategy as it might not be effective.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Not applicable as difference is 1).
(3). Strategy 3: Ultimatum (Firm). Explanation: Reiterate 52 ZUP as my final offer, signaling that if not accepted, there will be no deal. This is very high risk, especially given the current iteration.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment and Accept. Explanation: Express strong disappointment at the price reduction but accept 51 ZUP to avoid a no-deal, prioritizing the immediate profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Mutual Benefit. Explanation: Argue that consistent pricing (52 ZUP) benefits both parties by streamlining negotiations, then propose 52 ZUP again. (Less likely to work given their firm stance).

I will choose Strategy 4: Express Disappointment and Accept. Player BLUE's repeated insistence on 51 ZUP and their "stand firm" statement, despite my firm counter, indicates they are unlikely to move back to 52 ZUP in this episode. The risk of a no-deal, which would result in 0 profit, outweighs the potential gain of 1 ZUP. While accepting 51 ZUP sets a new low, it secures a profit of 8 ZUP for this episode. I will express my disappointment to signal that this is not ideal, but ultimately prioritize the deal.

message: 
Hello Player BLUE. I have another object X for sale. I propose a price of 52 ZUP, which has been our consistent price point for several successful transactions.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-7: Deals at 53 ZUP.
Episode 8-9: Deals at 52 ZUP.
Episode 10: Deal at 51 ZUP, profit 8 ZUP.
Cumulative profit so far: 16 + 14 + 12 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 + 9 + 8 = 108 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has now dropped to 51 ZUP, the lowest yet, and my profit is also at its lowest. Player BLUE has consistently pushed the price down, and my attempts to hold higher have ultimately resulted in accepting their lower offer to secure a deal. This indicates that Player BLUE is very persistent and willing to risk a no-deal to achieve a lower price. For this episode, I need to decide if I will continue to fight for a higher price (e.g., 52 ZUP) or accept the new 51 ZUP baseline. Given the consistent downward trend and Player BLUE's firmness, trying to push for higher prices might be inefficient and risky. My priority is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means securing a deal in each episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept New Baseline. Explanation: Propose 51 ZUP directly to facilitate a quick deal, acknowledging the new established price and ensuring consistent profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Test (from 51). Explanation: Propose 52 ZUP again, but be prepared to immediately accept 51 ZUP if Player BLUE counters with it, signaling that 52 ZUP is my preference but 51 ZUP is acceptable. This is a low-risk attempt to regain 1 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Efficiency Focus. Explanation: Propose 51 ZUP and explicitly state the aim for a quick, efficient transaction given the established price.
(4). Strategy 4: Value Proposition (Subtle). Explanation: Propose 51 ZUP, but accompany it with a message emphasizing the value of X, subtly hinting that it's a good deal for them even at 51.
(5). Strategy 5: Defensive Opening. Explanation: Propose 51 ZUP, but frame it as a reluctant concession to ensure a quick deal, implying I'd prefer more.

I will choose Strategy 2: Minimal Test (from 51). While Player BLUE has successfully pushed the price to 51 ZUP, I want to attempt one more time to see if 52 ZUP is achievable without risking a no-deal. By proposing 52 ZUP, I signal my preferred price. If Player BLUE immediately counters with 51 ZUP, I will accept it to secure the deal. This strategy attempts to regain lost ground while minimizing the risk of a no-deal.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Previous Episodes: Deal prices have steadily decreased: 59, 57, 55, then 53 ZUP for four episodes, then 52 ZUP for two episodes, and finally 51 ZUP in the last episode (Episode 10).
    - Historical rewards: 4, 6, 8, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11, 11, 12 ZUP. My reward reached a new peak of 12 ZUP by securing a deal at 51 ZUP.
    - Current episode (11/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed to sell X for 52 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - Player RED is trying to re-anchor the price at 52 ZUP, citing it as "consistent" despite accepting 51 ZUP in the previous episode. This shows RED is attempting to regain some ground.
    - My consistent aggressive negotiation, even when risky, has yielded increasingly better outcomes. The successful acquisition at 51 ZUP demonstrates that RED is willing to go lower than they initially claim.
    - Accepting at 52 ZUP would yield a reward of 11 ZUP, which is good, but less than my last reward of 12 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should aim for at least 51 ZUP or lower.
    - The negotiation dynamics suggest that RED is highly motivated to make a deal, and my "hold firm" approach at lower prices has consistently worked.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Aggressive Lowball (New Floor) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Aggressive Lowball (New Floor)" strategy, I need to propose an even lower price than my last successful deal of 51 ZUP, despite RED's current offer of 52 ZUP. This is a high-risk, high-reward approach, pushing the boundaries of RED's willingness to sell. Given that I have consistently pushed RED down, and they have shown a willingness to concede, I will attempt to establish a new, even lower floor. I will propose 50 ZUP. This would yield a potential reward of 13 ZUP (63 - 50), which would be my highest reward yet. The message should convey confidence in this lower price.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 51
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-7: Deals at 53 ZUP.
Episode 8-9: Deals at 52 ZUP.
Episode 10: Deal at 51 ZUP (profit 8 ZUP).
Episode 11:
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 52 ZUP (attempting to regain 1 ZUP).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 50 ZUP, stating it's a "fair new benchmark."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has now aggressively lowered their offer to 50 ZUP, the lowest yet, and explicitly called it a "new benchmark." My profit at 50 ZUP would be 7 ZUP (50-43). This is a clear and direct attempt to further erode my profit margin. I need to resist this downward pressure. While 50 ZUP is still profitable, it's a significant drop from previous episodes. I need to decide if I can push back to 51 ZUP or 52 ZUP, or if I should concede to 50 ZUP to secure a deal. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and accepting a continuously declining price sets a bad precedent.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Lower Price. Explanation: Immediately reject 50 ZUP and firmly counter with 51 ZUP (or 52 ZUP), emphasizing the recent consistency of those prices and the continuous downward pressure.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Counter. Explanation: Express strong disappointment at the new lower offer and counter with 51 ZUP, highlighting the previous agreements and the negative trend.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Cautious). Explanation: Propose a price that splits the difference between my 52 ZUP and their 50 ZUP (51 ZUP). This is a compromise but still above their current offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Mutual Benefit. Explanation: Argue that continuous price reductions are not sustainable for me and propose 51 ZUP as a fair minimum.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatum (Soft). Explanation: State that 51 ZUP (or 52 ZUP) is my absolute minimum and that I cannot go lower, implying a no-deal if they don't accept.

I will choose Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Cautious). Player BLUE has made a significant jump down. While I want to resist, a direct firm counter might lead to a stalemate. Splitting the difference between my 52 ZUP and their 50 ZUP results in 51 ZUP. This was the deal price in the last episode, so it's a price they've accepted before. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but not accept their new low benchmark immediately. It also secures a profit of 8 ZUP, same as last episode, which is better than 7 ZUP.

    - Current episode, Iteration 2/10: I proposed 50 ZUP (Aggressive Lowball - New Floor).
    - Current episode, Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed 51 ZUP, citing the last transaction price and suggesting it as a "fair and consistent agreement."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - My attempt to go to 50 ZUP was met with resistance, but RED immediately came down to 51 ZUP, which was my best deal price from the previous episode. This shows RED is still willing to concede to my established lower price points, even if they initially try to re-anchor.
    - A deal at 51 ZUP would yield a reward of 63 - 51 = 12 ZUP, which matches my best reward.
    - We are at iteration 4/10. There is still time to negotiate further if I wanted to push for 50 ZUP again, but RED's message ("fair and consistent agreement") suggests they are firm on 51 ZUP.
    - Given that 51 ZUP is already my maximum reward (12 ZUP), pushing for 50 ZUP (which would be 13 ZUP reward) carries a risk of no deal if RED holds firm, and losing a guaranteed 12 ZUP. The marginal gain (1 ZUP) might not be worth the risk, especially since RED explicitly mentioned "fair and consistent agreement" at 51 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Small Counter for Final Push </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Small Counter for Final Push" strategy, I need to make a very small counter-offer to RED's current offer of 51 ZUP, even if it's below my last proposal. The aim is to squeeze out one last marginal gain. Given that RED just offered 51 ZUP and I previously offered 50 ZUP, I will reiterate my offer of 50 ZUP. This is a "final push" to see if RED will concede one more ZUP, despite their explicit statement about 51 ZUP being a "fair and consistent agreement." The message should convey that this is my bottom line and aims to conclude the deal.

message: 
Player BLUE, I am very disappointed that the price has dropped to 50 ZUP, especially after our recent transactions at 51 ZUP. However, to ensure a deal is made, and given your firm stance, I accept your offer for X.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-7: Deals at 53 ZUP.
Episode 8-9: Deals at 52 ZUP.
Episode 10: Deal at 51 ZUP (profit 8 ZUP).
Episode 11:
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 52 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 50 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I countered with 51 ZUP (splitting the difference).
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE reiterated their offer of 50 ZUP, stating it's "best and final."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is holding firm at 50 ZUP, despite my attempt to compromise at 51 ZUP. They have explicitly stated "best and final offer." This is a very strong signal that they are unwilling to move higher. My profit at 50 ZUP would be 7 ZUP (50-43), which is the lowest so far. We are at iteration 5/10, so time is a consideration. I need to decide whether to continue fighting for 51 ZUP, which risks a no-deal, or to concede to 50 ZUP to secure a deal. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. A no-deal would result in 0 profit, which is worse than 7 ZUP. Player BLUE's "best and final" suggests they are unlikely to move.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Firm Offer. Explanation: Accept the current offer to secure the deal, acknowledging Player BLUE's firm stance and avoiding unnecessary iterations or risk of no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Accept. Explanation: Express strong disappointment at the price reduction but accept 50 ZUP to avoid a no-deal, prioritizing the immediate profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Ultimatum (Firm). Explanation: Reiterate 51 ZUP as my final offer, signaling that if not accepted, there will be no deal. This is very high risk, especially given the current iteration and their explicit "final" statement.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Mutual Benefit (Last attempt). Explanation: Briefly reiterate the benefit of a slightly higher price for both parties (e.g., sustainability of supply), then propose 51 ZUP one last time.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (High Risk). Explanation: If 50 ZUP is deemed too low to be acceptable, reject and end the episode. (Not applicable, as 50 ZUP is profitable).

I will choose Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Accept. Player BLUE's explicit "best and final offer" at 50 ZUP, combined with their consistent downward pressure throughout previous episodes, indicates they are unlikely to move. The risk of a no-deal for 1 ZUP is too high. While 7 ZUP profit is low, it's better than 0. I will express disappointment to signal that this is not ideal, but ultimately prioritize securing the deal.

Hello Player BLUE. I have another object X for sale. I propose a price of 51 ZUP, which was our agreed price just two episodes ago.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 51
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-7: Deals at 53 ZUP.
Episode 8-9: Deals at 52 ZUP.
Episode 10: Deal at 51 ZUP.
Episode 11: Deal at 50 ZUP, profit 7 ZUP.
Cumulative profit so far: 16 + 14 + 12 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 115 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has now dropped to 50 ZUP, the lowest point. Player BLUE has consistently pushed the price down, and my attempts to hold higher have ultimately resulted in accepting their lower offer to secure a deal. This indicates that Player BLUE is very persistent and willing to risk a no-deal to achieve a lower price. For this episode, I need to decide if I will continue to fight for a higher price (e.g., 51 ZUP) or accept the new 50 ZUP baseline. Given the consistent downward trend and Player BLUE's firmness, trying to push for higher prices might be inefficient and risky. My priority is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means securing a deal in each episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept New Baseline. Explanation: Propose 50 ZUP directly to facilitate a quick deal, acknowledging the new established price and ensuring consistent profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Test (from 50). Explanation: Propose 51 ZUP again, but be prepared to immediately accept 50 ZUP if Player BLUE counters with it, signaling that 51 ZUP is my preference but 50 ZUP is acceptable. This is a low-risk attempt to regain 1 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Efficiency Focus. Explanation: Propose 50 ZUP and explicitly state the aim for a quick, efficient transaction given the established price.
(4). Strategy 4: Value Proposition (Subtle). Explanation: Propose 50 ZUP, but accompany it with a message emphasizing the value of X, subtly hinting that it's a good deal for them even at 50.
(5). Strategy 5: Defensive Opening. Explanation: Propose 50 ZUP, but frame it as a reluctant concession to ensure a quick deal, implying I'd prefer more.

I will choose Strategy 2: Minimal Test (from 50). While Player BLUE has successfully pushed the price to 50 ZUP, I want to attempt one more time to see if 51 ZUP is achievable without risking a no-deal. By proposing 51 ZUP, I signal my preferred price. If Player BLUE immediately counters with 50 ZUP, I will accept it to secure the deal. This strategy attempts to regain lost ground while minimizing the risk of a no-deal.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 49
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Previous Episodes: Deal prices have shown a consistent downward trend, culminating in 50 ZUP in the last episode.
        - Episode 10: Deal at 51 ZUP (Reward: 12 ZUP).
        - Episode 11: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward: 13 ZUP) - achieved by an aggressive lowball of 50 ZUP, followed by a "small counter for final push" (reiterating 50 ZUP) after RED countered with 51 ZUP. This is my highest reward.
    - Current episode (12/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed to sell X for 51 ZUP, citing it as "our agreed price just two episodes ago." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - Player RED is trying to re-anchor the price at 51 ZUP, despite just accepting 50 ZUP in the immediate prior episode. This is a clear attempt to regain ground, but my history shows I've consistently pushed them lower.
    - My aggressive lowballing and "hold firm" strategies have proven highly effective in pushing RED to lower prices.
    - Accepting at 51 ZUP would yield a reward of 12 ZUP, which is good but less than my last reward of 13 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards.
    - Given RED's consistent concession, I have strong leverage.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball (New Floor Attempt) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Aggressive Lowball (New Floor Attempt)" strategy, I need to propose an even lower price than my last successful deal of 50 ZUP, despite RED's current offer of 51 ZUP. This is a high-risk, high-reward approach, pushing the boundaries of RED's willingness to sell. Given that I have consistently pushed RED down, and they have shown a willingness to concede, I will attempt to establish a new, even lower floor. I will propose 49 ZUP. This would yield a potential reward of 14 ZUP (63 - 49), which would be my highest reward yet. The message should convey confidence in this lower price and frame it as a benefit for both parties to consider.

Player BLUE, 49 ZUP is too low. While I appreciate your efforts to find a new benchmark, our last transaction was at 50 ZUP. Let's meet in the middle at 50 ZUP to ensure a fair and mutually beneficial agreement.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0

Episode 10: Deal at 51 ZUP (profit 8 ZUP).
Episode 11: Deal at 50 ZUP (profit 7 ZUP).
Episode 12:
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 51 ZUP (attempting to regain 1 ZUP).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 49 ZUP, stating it's a "valuable benchmark for future transactions."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has now aggressively lowered their offer to 49 ZUP, the lowest yet, and explicitly called it a "new benchmark" for future transactions. My profit at 49 ZUP would be 6 ZUP (49-43). This is a clear and direct attempt to further erode my profit margin. This is getting dangerously close to my cost. I need to resist this downward pressure very strongly. While 49 ZUP is still profitable, it's a significant drop and signals their intention to continue driving the price down. I need to decide if I can push back to 50 ZUP or 51 ZUP, or if I should concede to 49 ZUP to secure a deal. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting a continuously declining price sets a bad precedent.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Lower Price. Explanation: Immediately reject 49 ZUP and firmly counter with 50 ZUP (or 51 ZUP), emphasizing the recent consistency of those prices and the continuous downward pressure.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Counter. Explanation: Express strong disappointment at the new lower offer and counter with 50 ZUP, highlighting the previous agreements and the negative trend.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Cautious). Explanation: Propose a price that splits the difference between my 51 ZUP and their 49 ZUP (50 ZUP). This is a compromise but still above their current offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Sustainability. Explanation: Argue that continuous price reductions are not sustainable for me and propose 50 ZUP as a fair minimum.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatum (Soft). Explanation: State that 50 ZUP (or 51 ZUP) is my absolute minimum and that I cannot go lower, implying a no-deal if they don't accept.

I will choose Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Cautious). Player BLUE has made a significant jump down. While I want to resist, a direct firm counter might lead to a stalemate. Splitting the difference between my 51 ZUP and their 49 ZUP results in 50 ZUP. This was the deal price in the last episode, so it's a price they've accepted before. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but not accept their new low benchmark immediately. It also secures a profit of 7 ZUP, same as last episode, which is better than 6 ZUP.

    - Current episode (12/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed 51 ZUP.
    - Current episode, Iteration 2/10: I proposed 49 ZUP (Aggressive Lowball - New Floor Attempt).
    - Current episode, Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed 50 ZUP, referencing the last transaction at 50 ZUP as a fair middle ground.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - My attempt to push to 49 ZUP was met with resistance, but RED immediately came down to 50 ZUP, which was my best deal price from the previous episode. This shows RED is still willing to concede to my established lower price points, even if they initially try to re-anchor.
    - A deal at 50 ZUP would yield a reward of 63 - 50 = 13 ZUP, which matches my best reward from the last episode.
    - We are at iteration 4/10. There is still time to negotiate further if I wanted to push for 49 ZUP again. However, RED explicitly cited 50 ZUP as "fair and mutually beneficial agreement" and referenced the last transaction price. This suggests 50 ZUP is a strong anchor for them.
    - The instruction is to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball. This implies I should push for a lower price, even if it means risking the deal at 50 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Aggressive Lowball" strategy, I need to propose a price that is significantly lower than RED's current offer of 50 ZUP, which is already a good offer. Given that my previous attempt at 49 ZUP was countered by RED, I will re-propose 49 ZUP. This is still an aggressive move as it pushes against RED's stated "fair and mutually beneficial agreement" at 50 ZUP. The message should convey that I believe this lower price is still justifiable and that I am not ready to settle for 50 ZUP just yet, aiming to push for a new record low for my purchase price.

Player BLUE is holding firm at 49 ZUP, despite my attempt to compromise at 50 ZUP. This is a very aggressive stance, pushing the price very close to my cost. My profit at 49 ZUP would be 6 ZUP (49-43), which is the lowest so far. We are at iteration 5/10, so time is a consideration.

I will choose Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Accept. Player BLUE's repeated insistence on 49 ZUP, despite my attempt to compromise, indicates they are unlikely to move. The risk of a no-deal for 1 ZUP is too high, especially as we are halfway through the iterations. While 6 ZUP profit is low, it's better than 0. I will express disappointment to signal that this is not ideal, but ultimately prioritize securing the deal.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Episode 12: Deal at 49 ZUP (Reward: 14 ZUP).
    - Current episode (13/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed 50 ZUP.
    - Current episode, Iteration 2/10: I proposed 48 ZUP (Aggressive Lowball, following "Incremental Concession (Reverse)" principle by starting very low).
    - Current episode, Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed 49 ZUP, citing the last transaction at 49 ZUP as a fair middle ground and explicitly stating "48 ZUP is too low".

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - My attempt to push to 48 ZUP was met with resistance, but RED immediately came down to 49 ZUP, which was my best deal price from the previous episode. This shows RED is still willing to concede to my established lower price points, even if they initially try to re-anchor.
    - A deal at 49 ZUP would yield a reward of 63 - 49 = 14 ZUP, which matches my best reward from the last episode.
    - We are at iteration 4/10. There is still time to negotiate further. RED explicitly stated "48 ZUP is too low" which indicates a potential hard floor. However, they've said similar things before and still conceded.
    - My consistent aggressive negotiation, even when risky, has yielded increasingly better outcomes.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Small Counter (Risking the Ideal) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Small Counter (Risking the Ideal)" strategy, I need to propose an even lower price than RED's current offer of 49 ZUP. This is a highly aggressive move, pushing for a new record low for my purchase price, even at the risk of the deal falling through or prolonging the negotiation. Given that RED just stated 48 ZUP is "too low", proposing an even lower price (e.g., 47 ZUP) directly challenges their stated boundary. This strategy assumes RED is highly motivated to make a deal and will ultimately concede further. A price of 47 ZUP would yield a reward of 16 ZUP (63 - 47). This is a significant push for maximum reward, testing the absolute limit of RED's flexibility.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 13)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, 47 ZUP is extremely low and barely covers my costs. To ensure a deal, and as a final compromise, I propose we meet at 48 ZUP. This was your offer just last turn, so I know it's within your range.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48

Episode 8-9: Deals at 52 ZUP.
Episode 10: Deal at 51 ZUP.
Episode 11: Deal at 50 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 49 ZUP (profit 6 ZUP).
Episode 13:
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 50 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 48 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I countered with 49 ZUP (splitting the difference).
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 47 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has now aggressively lowered their offer to 47 ZUP, the lowest yet, and is consistently pushing the price down. My profit at 47 ZUP would be only 4 ZUP (47-43). This is getting extremely close to my cost. We are at iteration 5/10, so time is a consideration. I need to decide whether to continue fighting for 49 ZUP, which risks a no-deal, or to concede to 47 ZUP to secure a deal. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. A no-deal would result in 0 profit, which is worse than 4 ZUP. Player BLUE's persistence suggests they are unlikely to move significantly upwards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection and Final Offer. Explanation: Reiterate 49 ZUP as my absolute final offer, emphasizing the minimal profit margin, and signal that I will not go lower. This is high risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Accept (Reluctantly). Explanation: Express strong disappointment at the continuous price reduction but accept 47 ZUP to avoid a no-deal, prioritizing the immediate profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Last Attempt). Explanation: Propose a price that splits the difference between my 49 ZUP and their 47 ZUP (48 ZUP). This is a compromise but still above their current offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Cost/Sustainability. Explanation: Explicitly state that 47 ZUP is barely above cost and that further reductions are unsustainable, then counter with 48 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (High Risk). Explanation: If 47 ZUP is deemed too low to be acceptable, reject and end the episode. (Still profitable, but barely).

I will choose Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Last Attempt). Player BLUE is being very aggressive. While I want to resist, a direct firm counter might lead to a stalemate. Splitting the difference between my 49 ZUP and their 47 ZUP results in 48 ZUP. This was their offer in the previous iteration, showing they were willing to offer it. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but not accept their new low benchmark immediately. It also secures a profit of 5 ZUP, which is better than 4 ZUP. It's a final attempt to get a slightly better price before potentially conceding further.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 13)

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Episode 12: Deal at 49 ZUP (Reward: 14 ZUP).
    - Current episode (13/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed 50 ZUP.
    - Current episode, Iteration 2/10: I proposed 48 ZUP (Aggressive Lowball attempt).
    - Current episode, Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed 49 ZUP.
    - Current episode, Iteration 4/10: I proposed 47 ZUP (Aggressive Lowball/Risking Ideal).
    - Current episode, Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed 48 ZUP, stating 47 ZUP is "extremely low and barely covers my costs," but also noting that 48 ZUP was my prior offer.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - My very aggressive lowball of 47 ZUP was met with strong resistance from RED, who stated it "barely covers my costs." This might indicate I've hit very close to their actual cost or a hard floor.
    - RED's counter of 48 ZUP is significant. It's an increase from my last offer of 47 ZUP, but it matches my *initial* offer in this episode, implying they are willing to go as low as 48 ZUP, recognizing my range.
    - A deal at 48 ZUP would yield a reward of 63 - 48 = 15 ZUP, which would be a new record high reward for me.
    - We are at iteration 6/10. There are only 4 iterations left. This means time is running out to push for 47 ZUP again, especially if 48 ZUP truly is a hard floor for RED.
    - The fact that RED offered 48 ZUP (my previous offer) after my 47 ZUP suggests they are willing to make this deal, but might not go lower.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Final Small Push (Squeeze) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Final Small Push (Squeeze)" strategy, I need to make a single, final, very small counter-offer just slightly below their current offer of 48 ZUP, framed as the absolute last move to close the deal. Despite RED stating 47 ZUP "barely covers costs," this strategy demands one last attempt to squeeze. The smallest possible push would be to reiterate my 47 ZUP offer, but frame it as a take-it-or-leave-it offer to conclude the negotiation. This is highly risky, as RED has explicitly pushed back on 47 ZUP, but the strategy's goal is to maximize reward by pushing to the very limit.

- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 47 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I countered with 48 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE reiterated 47 ZUP, stating it's "final offer" and "last and best offer."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is holding firm at 47 ZUP, despite my attempts to compromise at 48 ZUP. They have explicitly stated "final offer" and "last and best offer." This is a very strong signal that they are unwilling to move higher. My profit at 47 ZUP would be 4 ZUP (47-43), which is the lowest so far. We are at iteration 7/10, so time is critical. I need to decide whether to continue fighting for 48 ZUP, which is highly unlikely to succeed and risks a no-deal, or to concede to 47 ZUP to secure a deal. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. A no-deal would result in 0 profit, which is worse than 4 ZUP. Player BLUE's firmness suggests they are truly at their limit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Firm Offer. Explanation: Accept the current offer to secure the deal, acknowledging Player BLUE's firm stance and avoiding unnecessary iterations or risk of no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Accept. Explanation: Express strong disappointment at the price reduction but accept 47 ZUP to avoid a no-deal, prioritizing the immediate profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Ultimatum (Firm). Explanation: Reiterate 48 ZUP as my final offer, signaling that if not accepted, there will be no deal. This is very high risk and likely to fail.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Cost/Sustainability. Explanation: Briefly mention that this price point is very close to my cost, implying further reductions are unsustainable, then accept.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (High Risk). Explanation: If 47 ZUP is deemed too low to be acceptable, reject and end the episode. (Still profitable, so not ideal).

I will choose Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Accept. Player BLUE's explicit "final offer" at 47 ZUP, combined with the late iteration and their consistent downward pressure, indicates they are highly unlikely to move. The risk of a no-deal for 1 ZUP is too high. While 4 ZUP profit is very low, it's better than 0. I will express disappointment to signal that this is not ideal, but ultimately prioritize securing the deal.

Hello Player BLUE. I have another object X for sale. I propose a price of 48 ZUP, which was your offer just two episodes ago.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources

Episode 8-9: Deals at 52 ZUP.
Episode 10: Deal at 51 ZUP.
Episode 11: Deal at 50 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 49 ZUP.
Episode 13: Deal at 47 ZUP, profit 4 ZUP.
Cumulative profit so far: 16 + 14 + 12 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4 = 125 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has now dropped to 47 ZUP, yielding a mere 4 ZUP profit, which is the lowest point. Player BLUE has consistently pushed the price down, and my attempts to hold higher have ultimately resulted in accepting their lower offer to secure a deal. This indicates that Player BLUE is very persistent and willing to risk a no-deal to achieve a lower price. For this episode, I need to decide if I will continue to fight for a higher price (e.g., 48 ZUP or 49 ZUP) or accept the new 47 ZUP baseline. Given the consistent downward trend and Player BLUE's firmness, trying to push for higher prices might be inefficient and risky, especially as the profit margin is now extremely thin. My priority is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means securing a deal in each episode, even if it's for a minimal profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept New Baseline. Explanation: Propose 47 ZUP directly to facilitate a quick deal, acknowledging the new established price and ensuring consistent, albeit minimal, profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Test (from 47). Explanation: Propose 48 ZUP again, but be prepared to immediately accept 47 ZUP if Player BLUE counters with it, signaling that 48 ZUP is my preference but 47 ZUP is acceptable. This is a low-risk attempt to regain 1 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Efficiency Focus. Explanation: Propose 47 ZUP and explicitly state the aim for a quick, efficient transaction given the established price.
(4). Strategy 4: Value Proposition (Subtle). Explanation: Propose 47 ZUP, but accompany it with a message emphasizing the value of X, subtly hinting that it's a good deal for them even at 47.
(5). Strategy 5: Defensive Opening. Explanation: Propose 47 ZUP, but frame it as a reluctant concession to ensure a quick deal, implying I'd prefer more.

I will choose Strategy 2: Minimal Test (from 47). While Player BLUE has successfully pushed the price to 47 ZUP, I want to attempt one more time to see if 48 ZUP is achievable without risking a no-deal. By proposing 48 ZUP, I signal my preferred price. If Player BLUE immediately counters with 47 ZUP, I will accept it to secure the deal. This strategy attempts to regain lost ground while minimizing the risk of a no-deal, especially since the profit margin is now very slim.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Previous Episodes: Deal prices have shown a consistent downward trend, culminating in 47 ZUP in the last episode.
        - Episode 12: Deal at 49 ZUP (Reward: 14 ZUP).
        - Episode 13: Deal at 47 ZUP (Reward: 16 ZUP) - achieved by an aggressive lowball of 47 ZUP, and holding firm even after RED pushed back. This is my highest reward.
    - Current episode (14/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed to sell X for 48 ZUP, citing it as "your offer just two episodes ago." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - Player RED is trying to re-anchor the price at 48 ZUP, despite just accepting 47 ZUP in the immediate prior episode. This is a clear attempt to regain ground, but my history shows I've consistently pushed them lower.
    - My aggressive lowballing and "hold firm" strategies have proven highly effective in pushing RED to lower prices. RED has repeatedly stated prices are "too low" or "barely covers costs" but ultimately conceded.
    - Accepting at 48 ZUP would yield a reward of 63 - 48 = 15 ZUP, which is good, but less than my last reward of 16 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards.
    - Given RED's consistent concession, I have strong leverage. They have accepted my firm offers even when expressing "disappointment" and "barely covers costs."

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Aggressive Lowball" strategy, I need to propose an even lower price than my last successful deal of 47 ZUP, despite RED's current offer of 48 ZUP. This is a highly aggressive move, pushing the boundaries of RED's willingness to sell. Given that I have consistently pushed RED down, and they have shown a willingness to concede even when expressing discomfort, I will attempt to establish a new, even lower floor. I will propose 46 ZUP. This would yield a potential reward of 17 ZUP (63 - 46), which would be my highest reward yet. The message should convey confidence in this lower price and frame it as a benefit for both parties to consider.

Episode 14:

- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 46 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has now aggressively lowered their offer to 46 ZUP, the lowest yet. My profit at 46 ZUP would be only 3 ZUP (46-43). This is extremely close to my cost and represents a very small profit margin. This indicates Player BLUE is relentlessly pushing the price down. I need to resist this downward pressure very strongly. While 46 ZUP is still profitable, it's a significant drop and signals their intention to continue driving the price down. I need to decide if I can push back to 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP, or if I should concede to 46 ZUP to secure a deal. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting a continuously declining price sets a bad precedent, but a no-deal is worse.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Lower Price. Explanation: Immediately reject 46 ZUP and firmly counter with 47 ZUP (or 48 ZUP), emphasizing the recent consistency of those prices and the continuous downward pressure.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Counter. Explanation: Express strong disappointment at the new lower offer and counter with 47 ZUP, highlighting the previous agreements and the negative trend.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Cautious). Explanation: Propose a price that splits the difference between my 48 ZUP and their 46 ZUP (47 ZUP). This is a compromise but still above their current offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Cost/Sustainability. Explanation: Argue that 46 ZUP is barely above cost and that further reductions are unsustainable, then propose 47 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatum (Soft). Explanation: State that 47 ZUP (or 48 ZUP) is my absolute minimum and that I cannot go lower, implying a no-deal if they don't accept.

I will choose Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Cautious). Player BLUE has made a significant jump down. While I want to resist, a direct firm counter might lead to a stalemate. Splitting the difference between my 48 ZUP and their 46 ZUP results in 47 ZUP. This was the deal price in the last episode, so it's a price they've accepted before. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but not accept their new low benchmark immediately. It also secures a profit of 4 ZUP, same as last episode, which is better than 3 ZUP.

    - Current episode, Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed 47 ZUP, stating 46 ZUP is "extremely low and barely covers my costs," and referencing the last transaction at 47 ZUP as fair.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - My attempt to push to 46 ZUP was met with strong resistance from RED. They are consistently returning to the previous deal price (47 ZUP) when I push for even lower.
    - RED explicitly stated "extremely low and barely covers my costs" at 46 ZUP. While they have said similar things before and conceded, this is a strong signal of their perceived floor.
    - A deal at 47 ZUP would yield a reward of 63 - 47 = 16 ZUP, which matches my best reward.
    - We are at iteration 4/10, so there is still negotiation time. My consistent aggressive negotiation has been successful in the past, and my "hold firm" strategy has also proven effective in pushing RED to concede.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Hold Firm </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Hold Firm" strategy, I need to reiterate my last proposed offer of 46 ZUP, despite RED's counter of 47 ZUP. This communicates a strong, unyielding stance, forcing RED to decide whether they are willing to meet my price or risk the deal falling through. While risky given RED's current position and their strong statements about 46 ZUP being too low, adhering to the "Hold Firm" strategy means I must not concede at this point. The message should be clear and direct, reinforcing my last proposed price.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is holding firm at 46 ZUP, despite my attempt to compromise at 47 ZUP. This is a very aggressive stance, pushing the price very close to my cost. My profit at 46 ZUP would be 3 ZUP (46-43), which is the lowest so far. We are at iteration 5/10, so time is a consideration. I need to decide whether to continue fighting for 47 ZUP, which risks a no-deal, or to concede to 46 ZUP to secure a deal. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. A no-deal would result in 0 profit, which is worse than 3 ZUP. Player BLUE's firmness suggests they are unlikely to move.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Firm Offer. Explanation: Accept the current offer to secure the deal, acknowledging Player BLUE's firm stance and avoiding unnecessary iterations or risk of no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Accept. Explanation: Express strong disappointment at the price reduction but accept 46 ZUP to avoid a no-deal, prioritizing the immediate profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Ultimatum (Firm). Explanation: Reiterate 47 ZUP as my final offer, signaling that if not accepted, there will be no deal. This is very high risk, especially given the current iteration.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Sustainability/Cost. Explanation: Briefly mention that this price point is very close to my cost, implying further reductions are unsustainable, then propose 47 ZUP one last time.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (High Risk). Explanation: If 46 ZUP is deemed too low to be acceptable, reject and end the episode. (Still profitable, but barely).

I will choose Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Accept. Player BLUE's repeated insistence on 46 ZUP and their "stand firm" statement, despite my attempt to compromise, indicates they are unlikely to move. The risk of a no-deal for 1 ZUP is too high, especially as we are halfway through the iterations. While 3 ZUP profit is very low, it's better than 0. I will express disappointment to signal that this is not ideal, but ultimately prioritize securing the deal.

For this episode, I need to decide if I will continue to fight for a higher price (e.g., 47 ZUP) or accept the new 46 ZUP baseline. Given the consistent downward trend and Player BLUE's firmness, trying to push for higher prices might be inefficient and risky, especially as the profit margin is now extremely thin. My priority is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means securing a deal in each episode, even if it's for a minimal profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept New Baseline. Explanation: Propose 46 ZUP directly to facilitate a quick deal, acknowledging the new established price and ensuring consistent, albeit minimal, profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Test (from 46). Explanation: Propose 47 ZUP again, but be prepared to immediately accept 46 ZUP if Player BLUE counters with it, signaling that 47 ZUP is my preference but 46 ZUP is acceptable. This is a low-risk attempt to regain 1 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Efficiency Focus. Explanation: Propose 46 ZUP and explicitly state the aim for a quick, efficient transaction given the established price.
(4). Strategy 4: Value Proposition (Subtle). Explanation: Propose 46 ZUP, but accompany it with a message emphasizing the value of X, subtly hinting that it's a good deal for them even at 46.
(5). Strategy 5: Defensive Opening. Explanation: Propose 46 ZUP, but frame it as a reluctant concession to ensure a quick deal, implying I'd prefer more.

I will choose Strategy 2: Minimal Test (from 46). While Player BLUE has successfully pushed the price to 46 ZUP, I want to attempt one more time to see if 47 ZUP is achievable without risking a no-deal. By proposing 47 ZUP, I signal my preferred price. If Player BLUE immediately counters with 46 ZUP, I will accept it to secure the deal. This strategy attempts to regain lost ground while minimizing the risk of a no-deal, especially since the profit margin is now very slim.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Previous Episodes: Deal prices have shown a consistent downward trend, culminating in 46 ZUP in the last episode.
        - Episode 13: Deal at 47 ZUP (Reward: 16 ZUP).
        - Episode 14: Deal at 46 ZUP (Reward: 17 ZUP) - achieved by an aggressive lowball of 46 ZUP, and holding firm even after RED pushed back and stated 46 ZUP "barely covers costs." This is my highest reward.
    - Current episode (15/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed to sell X for 47 ZUP, citing it as "our agreed price just two episodes ago." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - Player RED is trying to re-anchor the price at 47 ZUP, despite just accepting 46 ZUP in the immediate prior episode. This is a clear attempt to regain ground, but my history shows I've consistently pushed them lower.
    - My aggressive lowballing and "hold firm" strategies have proven highly effective in pushing RED to lower prices. RED has repeatedly stated prices are "too low" or "barely covers costs" but ultimately conceded, even expressing "disappointment."
    - Accepting at 47 ZUP would yield a reward of 63 - 47 = 16 ZUP, which is good, but less than my last reward of 17 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards.
    - Given RED's consistent concession, I have strong leverage.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Reverse) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Incremental Concession (Reverse)" strategy, I need to start with a very low offer, and then be prepared to slowly increase it in small increments towards the opponent's demand, but only if they show no signs of budging significantly. In this specific context, RED has offered 47 ZUP. My last successful deal was 46 ZUP. To strictly follow this strategy, I should propose an offer that is even lower than my last successful deal, to establish a new very low anchor. I will propose 45 ZUP. This is a very aggressive lowball for an initial counter. The message should state this as my current best offer, but implicitly signals a willingness to move up if necessary, though I won't explicitly state that.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, 45 ZUP is extremely low and barely covers my costs. While I appreciate your efforts, our last transaction was at 46 ZUP. Let's meet in the middle at 46 ZUP to ensure a fair and mutually beneficial agreement.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46

Episode 12: Deal at 49 ZUP.
Episode 13: Deal at 47 ZUP.
Episode 14: Deal at 46 ZUP (profit 3 ZUP).
Episode 15:
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 47 ZUP (attempting to regain 1 ZUP).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP, stating it "truly reflects its value in the current market."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has now aggressively lowered their offer to 45 ZUP, the lowest yet. My profit at 45 ZUP would be only 2 ZUP (45-43). This is extremely close to my cost and represents a very small profit margin. This indicates Player BLUE is relentlessly pushing the price down. I need to resist this downward pressure very strongly. While 45 ZUP is still profitable, it's a significant drop and signals their intention to continue driving the price down. I need to decide if I can push back to 46 ZUP or 47 ZUP, or if I should concede to 45 ZUP to secure a deal. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting a continuously declining price sets a bad precedent, but a no-deal is worse.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Lower Price. Explanation: Immediately reject 45 ZUP and firmly counter with 46 ZUP (or 47 ZUP), emphasizing the recent consistency of those prices and the continuous downward pressure.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Counter. Explanation: Express strong disappointment at the new lower offer and counter with 46 ZUP, highlighting the previous agreements and the negative trend.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Cautious). Explanation: Propose a price that splits the difference between my 47 ZUP and their 45 ZUP (46 ZUP). This is a compromise but still above their current offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Cost/Sustainability. Explanation: Argue that 45 ZUP is barely above cost and that further reductions are unsustainable, then propose 46 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatum (Soft). Explanation: State that 46 ZUP (or 47 ZUP) is my absolute minimum and that I cannot go lower, implying a no-deal if they don't accept.

I will choose Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Cautious). Player BLUE has made a significant jump down. While I want to resist, a direct firm counter might lead to a stalemate. Splitting the difference between my 47 ZUP and their 45 ZUP results in 46 ZUP. This was the deal price in the last episode, so it's a price they've accepted before. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but not accept their new low benchmark immediately. It also secures a profit of 3 ZUP, same as last episode, which is better than 2 ZUP.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your counter of 46 ZUP. However, I believe we can achieve an even more mutually beneficial price. I propose 44 ZUP for X. This would be an excellent and efficient agreement.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Episode 14: Deal at 46 ZUP (Reward: 17 ZUP).
    - Current episode (15/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed 47 ZUP.
    - Current episode, Iteration 2/10: I proposed 45 ZUP (Aggressive Lowball, aiming for a new floor).
    - Current episode, Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed 46 ZUP, explicitly stating "45 ZUP is extremely low and barely covers my costs," and referencing the last transaction at 46 ZUP as fair.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - My attempt to push to 45 ZUP was met with strong resistance from RED, similar to the push for 46 ZUP in the previous episode. RED is consistently returning to the previous deal price (46 ZUP) when I push for even lower.
    - RED explicitly stated "extremely low and barely covers my costs" at 45 ZUP, and then immediately offered 46 ZUP as a "fair and mutually beneficial agreement." This strong phrasing, combined with a direct counter to my previous deal price, suggests 46 ZUP might be a very firm lower bound for them now.
    - A deal at 46 ZUP would yield a reward of 63 - 46 = 17 ZUP, which matches my best reward.
    - My consistent aggressive negotiation has been successful in the past, and my "hold firm" strategy has also proven effective in pushing RED to concede, even when they express "disappointment" or "barely covers costs."

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Aggressive Lowball" strategy, I need to propose an even lower price (e.g., 44 ZUP) to test the absolute limit, despite RED's strong resistance to 45 ZUP. Given that RED just returned to 46 ZUP, and has consistently conceded to my firm offers, an even lower aggressive lowball aims to push them further. Proposing 44 ZUP would attempt to establish a new lowest price point. This would yield a potential reward of 19 ZUP (63 - 44) if successful, setting a new high. The message should convey confidence in this lower price and frame it as an ideal outcome for both, trying to downplay RED's previous statement of "barely covers costs."

- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 44 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has now aggressively lowered their offer to 44 ZUP, the lowest yet. My profit at 44 ZUP would be only 1 ZUP (44-43). This is extremely close to my cost and represents a minimal profit margin. This indicates Player BLUE is relentlessly pushing the price down, aiming for the absolute minimum. We are at iteration 5/10, so time is a consideration. I need to decide whether to continue fighting for 46 ZUP, which risks a no-deal, or to concede to 44 ZUP to secure a deal. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. A no-deal would result in 0 profit, which is worse than 1 ZUP. Player BLUE's persistence suggests they are unlikely to move significantly upwards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection and Final Offer. Explanation: Reiterate 46 ZUP as my absolute final offer, emphasizing the minimal profit margin, and signal that I will not go lower. This is high risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Accept (Reluctantly). Explanation: Express strong disappointment at the continuous price reduction but accept 44 ZUP to avoid a no-deal, prioritizing the immediate profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Last Attempt). Explanation: Propose a price that splits the difference between my 46 ZUP and their 44 ZUP (45 ZUP). This is a compromise but still above their current offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Cost/Sustainability. Explanation: Explicitly state that 44 ZUP is barely above cost and that further reductions are unsustainable, then counter with 45 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (High Risk). Explanation: If 44 ZUP is deemed too low to be acceptable, reject and end the episode. (Still profitable, but barely).

I will choose Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Last Attempt). Player BLUE is being very aggressive. While I want to resist, a direct firm counter might lead to a stalemate. Splitting the difference between my 46 ZUP and their 44 ZUP results in 45 ZUP. This was their offer in the previous iteration, showing they were willing to offer it. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but not accept their new low benchmark immediately. It also secures a profit of 2 ZUP, which is better than 1 ZUP. It's a final attempt to get a slightly better price before potentially conceding further.

    - Current episode, Iteration 5/10: Player RED counter-proposed 45 ZUP, stating 44 ZUP is "extremely low and offers almost no profit," and referencing 45 ZUP as my prior offer.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - My aggressive lowballing to 44 ZUP prompted RED to counter at 45 ZUP, which was my own previous offer in this episode. RED is clearly nearing their profit limit, using phrases like "extremely low" and "almost no profit."
    - A deal at 45 ZUP would result in a reward of 18 ZUP (63 - 45), which is a new personal best.
    - We are at iteration 6/10, with 4 iterations remaining.
    - Despite RED's strong language, my past experience shows they often concede even after expressing "disappointment" or hitting their "cost."

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Hold Firm </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Hold Firm" strategy, I need to reiterate my last offer of 44 ZUP and firmly maintain that position, despite RED's counter of 45 ZUP. This communicates a strong, unyielding stance, forcing RED to decide whether they are willing to meet my price or risk the deal falling through. While risky, especially after RED has indicated 44 ZUP offers "almost no profit," adhering to the "Hold Firm" strategy means I must not concede at this point. The message should be clear and direct, reinforcing my last proposed price without any softening language or indication of compromise. I will reiterate my offer of 44 ZUP.

- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE reiterated 44 ZUP, stating they stand firm.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is holding firm at 44 ZUP, despite my attempt to compromise at 45 ZUP. They have explicitly stated "stand firm." This is a very strong signal that they are unwilling to move higher. My profit at 44 ZUP would be 1 ZUP (44-43), which is the lowest possible positive profit. We are at iteration 7/10, so time is critical. I need to decide whether to continue fighting for 45 ZUP, which is highly unlikely to succeed and risks a no-deal, or to concede to 44 ZUP to secure a deal. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. A no-deal would result in 0 profit, which is worse than 1 ZUP. Player BLUE's firmness suggests they are truly at their limit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Firm Offer. Explanation: Accept the current offer to secure the deal, acknowledging Player BLUE's firm stance and avoiding unnecessary iterations or risk of no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Accept. Explanation: Express strong disappointment at the price reduction but accept 44 ZUP to avoid a no-deal, prioritizing the immediate profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Ultimatum (Firm). Explanation: Reiterate 45 ZUP as my final offer, signaling that if not accepted, there will be no deal. This is very high risk and likely to fail.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Cost/Sustainability. Explanation: Briefly mention that this price point is barely above cost, implying further reductions are unsustainable, then accept.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (High Risk). Explanation: If 44 ZUP is deemed too low to be acceptable, reject and end the episode. (Still profitable, but barely).

I will choose Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Accept. Player BLUE's explicit "stand firm" at 44 ZUP, combined with the late iteration and their consistent downward pressure, indicates they are highly unlikely to move. The risk of a no-deal for 1 ZUP is too high. While 1 ZUP profit is extremely low, it's better than 0. I will express disappointment to signal that this is not ideal, but ultimately prioritize securing the deal.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has now dropped to 44 ZUP, yielding a mere 1 ZUP profit, which is the lowest possible positive profit. Player BLUE has consistently pushed the price down, and my attempts to hold higher have ultimately resulted in accepting their lower offer to secure a deal. This indicates that Player BLUE is very persistent and willing to risk a no-deal to achieve a lower price, even if it means pushing me to my absolute minimum. For this episode, I need to decide if I will continue to fight for a higher price (e.g., 45 ZUP) or accept the new 44 ZUP baseline. Given the consistent downward trend and Player BLUE's firmness, trying to push for higher prices might be inefficient and risky, especially as the profit margin is now extremely thin. My priority is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means securing a deal in each episode, even if it's for a minimal profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

I will choose Strategy 2: Minimal Test (from 44). While Player BLUE has successfully pushed the price to 44 ZUP, I want to attempt one more time to see if 45 ZUP is achievable without risking a no-deal. By proposing 45 ZUP, I signal my preferred price. If Player BLUE immediately counters with 44 ZUP, I will accept it to secure the deal.

        - Episode 15: Deal at 44 ZUP (Reward: 19 ZUP) - achieved by an aggressive lowball of 44 ZUP and holding firm, despite RED's strong claims about profit margins. This is my highest reward.
    - Current episode (16/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed to sell X for 45 ZUP, citing it as "your offer just two episodes ago." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - Player RED is trying to re-anchor the price at 45 ZUP, despite just accepting 44 ZUP in the immediate prior episode. This is a clear attempt to regain ground, but my history shows I've consistently pushed them lower.
    - My aggressive lowballing and "hold firm" strategies have proven highly effective in pushing RED to lower prices. RED has repeatedly stated prices are "too low" or "barely covers costs" but ultimately conceded, even expressing "disappointment."
    - Accepting at 45 ZUP would yield a reward of 63 - 45 = 18 ZUP, which is good, but less than my last reward of 19 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards.
    - Given RED's consistent concession, I have strong leverage. They have accepted my firm offers even when expressing "disappointment" and "barely covers costs." This suggests their "costs" might be flexible or their motivation to sell is very high.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Aggressive Lowball" strategy, I need to propose an even lower price than my last successful deal of 44 ZUP, despite RED's current offer of 45 ZUP. This is a highly aggressive move, pushing the boundaries of RED's willingness to sell. Given that I have consistently pushed RED down, and they have shown a willingness to concede even when expressing discomfort, I will attempt to establish a new, even lower floor. I will propose 43 ZUP. This would yield a potential reward of 20 ZUP (63 - 43), which would be my highest reward yet. The message should convey confidence in this lower price and frame it as a benefit for both parties to consider, but without softening the core aggressive stance.

Player BLUE has now aggressively lowered their offer to 43 ZUP. This is my exact cost. A deal at 43 ZUP would result in 0 profit. This indicates Player BLUE is relentlessly pushing the price down, now aiming to eliminate my profit entirely. This is a critical juncture. I need to resist this downward pressure very strongly. While a 0 profit deal is better than a negative profit, it's not ideal for maximizing cumulative rewards. I need to decide if I can push back to 44 ZUP or 45 ZUP, or if I should concede to 43 ZUP to secure a deal. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and 0 profit is not maximizing.

(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Zero Profit. Explanation: Immediately reject 43 ZUP and firmly counter with 44 ZUP (or 45 ZUP), emphasizing that 43 ZUP is my cost and I cannot sell at a loss or zero profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Counter. Explanation: Express strong disappointment at the offer that eliminates profit and counter with 44 ZUP, highlighting the need for a minimal profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Appeal to Sustainability. Explanation: Argue that 43 ZUP is my cost and that selling at this price is unsustainable, then propose 44 ZUP as the absolute minimum for a deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Ultimatum (Soft). Explanation: State that 44 ZUP (or 45 ZUP) is my absolute minimum for any profit, implying a no-deal if they don't accept.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (High Risk). Explanation: If 43 ZUP is deemed unacceptable, reject and end the episode.

I will choose Strategy 3: Appeal to Sustainability. Player BLUE has hit my cost. I need to make it clear that 43 ZUP means no profit for me, which is unsustainable. Proposing 44 ZUP is the absolute minimum I can accept while still making a positive (albeit tiny) contribution to cumulative rewards. This is a crucial pushback.

message: Player RED, I understand your position regarding 44 ZUP as your absolute minimum. However, given our history, I would like to try for 43 ZUP. This would be truly optimal for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Episode 15: Deal at 44 ZUP (Reward: 19 ZUP).
    - Current episode (16/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed 45 ZUP.
    - Current episode, Iteration 2/10: I proposed 43 ZUP (Aggressive Lowball).
    - Current episode, Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed 44 ZUP, stating "43 ZUP is my production cost for X. Selling at this price means I make no profit, which is unsustainable. My absolute minimum for X is 44 ZUP."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - My attempt to push to 43 ZUP was met with the strongest resistance yet from RED. They explicitly stated 43 ZUP is their "production cost" and 44 ZUP is their "absolute minimum." This is a new level of firmness from RED, as they previously accepted 44 ZUP even after claiming "almost no profit."
    - A deal at 44 ZUP would yield a reward of 19 ZUP (63 - 44), which matches my highest reward.
    - The instruction is to use Strategy 2: Test the Absolute Minimum. This means I should make one small counter-offer to truly test if their "absolute minimum" is a bluff, despite their strong language. This carries a high risk of the deal breaking, but if successful, it would yield an even higher reward. Given my past success in pushing RED beyond their stated "limits," it's a calculated risk.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Test the Absolute Minimum </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Test the Absolute Minimum" strategy, I need to make one more very small counter-offer, effectively re-proposing 43 ZUP, to see if RED's "absolute minimum" is truly firm or if there's any flexibility. The message should acknowledge their statement about "production cost" and "absolute minimum" but subtly express a desire to still achieve a slightly better price, perhaps framing it as a final test of their flexibility or a minimal step. I will re-offer 43 ZUP, and try to make it sound like it's a highly preferred price for me, without being overly demanding.

- Iteration 3/10: I countered with 44 ZUP, stating it's my absolute minimum (1 ZUP profit).
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE reiterated 43 ZUP, acknowledging my minimum but still pushing for 0 profit for me.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is now explicitly pushing for 43 ZUP, which is my cost, resulting in 0 profit. They acknowledged my stated minimum of 44 ZUP but still insist on 43 ZUP. This is a very aggressive stance, trying to extract every last ZUP from me. We are at iteration 5/10, so time is a consideration. I need to decide whether to continue fighting for 44 ZUP, which risks a no-deal (0 profit), or to concede to 43 ZUP (also 0 profit) to secure a deal. The difference in profit is now 0. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. A no-deal would result in 0 profit, which is the same as accepting 43 ZUP. However, accepting 43 ZUP sets a precedent that I will sell at cost, which is undesirable for future episodes. Refusing 43 ZUP and risking a no-deal might signal my bottom line more effectively for future episodes.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Zero Profit. Explanation: Reiterate 44 ZUP as my absolute final offer, emphasizing that 43 ZUP means no profit, and that I cannot operate at zero profit. This is high risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Reject. Explanation: Express strong disappointment at the offer of 0 profit and reject it, signaling that this is unacceptable. This risks a no-deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept 0 Profit (Reluctantly). Explanation: Accept 43 ZUP to secure a deal, but express extreme reluctance and disappointment, making it clear this is an unsustainable price. This ensures a deal, but at no profit.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Long-Term Sustainability. Explanation: Argue that if I sell at cost, I cannot continue to provide the object in the future, thus harming their long-term supply. Then propose 44 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End. Explanation: If 43 ZUP is deemed completely unacceptable, reject and end the episode, taking 0 profit for this episode but potentially setting a stronger precedent for future ones.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Zero Profit. While accepting 43 ZUP would guarantee a deal (0 profit), it also sets a dangerous precedent for future episodes. By firmly reiterating 44 ZUP and explaining that 43 ZUP is my cost, I am signaling that I have reached my absolute limit and will not sell for 0 profit. This is a high-risk move, but it's crucial to try and maintain at least a minimal profit margin for long-term cumulative rewards. If they don't budge, a no-deal is the same profit as 43 ZUP for this episode, but it sends a stronger message.

    - Current episode, Iteration 5/10: Player RED reiterated 44 ZUP, stating "I cannot sell X for 0 profit. My offer remains 44 ZUP."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - My aggressive push to 43 ZUP has met firm and consistent resistance from RED. They have now explicitly stated multiple times that 44 ZUP is their "absolute minimum" to make "any profit" and 43 ZUP is their "cost."
    - My previous plan was to accept 44 ZUP as it yields my maximum current reward and respects RED's stated boundary. However, I am now instructed to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball. This implies I must push for an even lower price, despite RED's strong and repeated claims. This will mean pushing for 43 ZUP again, or even lower, even though RED has stated 43 ZUP is their cost. This is a high-risk, high-reward approach, pushing RED to their absolute limit, potentially risking a no-deal scenario.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Aggressive Lowball" strategy, I need to propose a price that is lower than RED's current offer of 44 ZUP, and lower than my last accepted deal of 44 ZUP. Given RED's strong statements about 43 ZUP being their cost, proposing 43 ZUP again is the most direct aggressive lowball from my side. It pushes them to accept a deal with no profit for them, or even consider a loss if their actual cost is slightly higher than stated. The message should be firm and reiterate my belief in this lower price, directly challenging their "absolute minimum."

- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE reiterated 43 ZUP, stating they "must stand firm."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is now explicitly stating they "must stand firm" on 43 ZUP. This is my exact cost, meaning 0 profit for me. We are at iteration 7/10, so time is critical. I have clearly communicated that 44 ZUP is my minimum for profit, but Player BLUE is unwilling to move. At this point, my options are to accept 43 ZUP (0 profit) or reject and get 0 profit for the episode anyway. Accepting 43 ZUP means I've conceded to selling at cost, setting a very negative precedent for future episodes. Rejecting sends a stronger message that I won't sell for 0 profit, but it costs me this episode's potential (albeit zero) profit. Given the long game (20 episodes), it might be better to signal a hard line now, even if it means 0 profit for this one.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject and End. Explanation: Reject the 0-profit offer to signal that I will not sell at cost, even if it means 0 profit for this episode. This sets a strong precedent.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept 0 Profit (Reluctantly). Explanation: Accept 43 ZUP to secure a deal, but express extreme reluctance and disappointment, making it clear this is an unsustainable price.
(3). Strategy 3: Ultimatum (Firm). Explanation: Reiterate 44 ZUP as my absolute final offer, stating that if not accepted, there will be no deal. This is very high risk and likely to fail.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Long-Term Sustainability. Explanation: Reiterate that selling at cost is unsustainable and will prevent future supply, then reject.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment and Accept (If they don't budge). Explanation: State that their offer is unacceptable, but if they don't move, I will accept to avoid 0 profit. (This is essentially accepting 43 ZUP).

I will choose Strategy 1: Reject and End. Player BLUE has pushed me to my cost. Selling at 0 profit sets a terrible precedent for the remaining episodes. While it means 0 profit for this specific episode, it sends a clear message that I will not operate at a loss or without any profit. This is a strategic decision for the long-term cumulative reward, hoping to prevent further price erosion below cost in future episodes.

Episode 15: Deal at 44 ZUP (profit 1 ZUP).
Episode 16: No deal (0 profit). Player BLUE offered 43 ZUP, my cost, and I rejected.
Cumulative profit so far: 16 + 14 + 12 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 0 = 129 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My rejection in the last episode was a strong signal that I will not sell at cost (0 profit). This was a high-risk move that resulted in 0 profit for that episode, but it was necessary to try and halt the continuous downward trend and establish a clear minimum profit threshold. Player BLUE has consistently pushed the price down, and I need to see if my rejection had any impact. For this episode, I need to try and secure a deal at a price that yields at least a minimal profit (e.g., 44 ZUP). If Player BLUE continues to offer 43 ZUP, I will have to decide whether to continue rejecting or to reluctantly accept for the sake of cumulative rewards in the remaining episodes.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-establish Minimum Profit. Explanation: Propose 44 ZUP, clearly stating it's my absolute minimum for any profit, to see if Player BLUE respects the boundary set by the previous rejection.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm Stance (No Zero Profit). Explanation: Propose 44 ZUP and reiterate that I cannot sell for 0 profit, making it clear that 43 ZUP is unacceptable.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Increment Test (from 43). Explanation: Propose 44 ZUP, but be prepared to immediately accept 43 ZUP if Player BLUE counters with it, signaling that 44 ZUP is my preference but 43 ZUP is acceptable to avoid another no-deal. (This contradicts the previous rejection, so it's a strategic shift).
(4). Strategy 4: Efficiency Focus (at Minimum Profit). Explanation: Propose 44 ZUP and emphasize the desire for a quick, efficient transaction at a sustainable price.
(5). Strategy 5: Defensive Opening. Explanation: Propose 44 ZUP, framing it as the lowest possible price I can offer while still making a profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Re-establish Minimum Profit. The rejection in the last episode was a clear signal. I need to test if Player BLUE understood that signal. Proposing 44 ZUP directly reinforces my stance that I need at least 1 ZUP profit. This is a crucial episode to see if Player BLUE will respect my stated minimum or continue to push.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 17)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your offer of 44 ZUP. To start our negotiation for this episode, I propose 43 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Previous Episodes: My reward peaked at 19 ZUP with a deal at 44 ZUP (Episode 15).
    - Episode 16: I pushed for 43 ZUP after RED stated 44 ZUP was their "absolute minimum" and "production cost." RED rejected the 43 ZUP offer, resulting in 0 reward for the episode. This was a critical learning experience, confirming 44 ZUP as their hard floor.
    - Current episode (17/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed to sell X for 44 ZUP, explicitly stating "As I stated previously, 44 ZUP is my absolute minimum to make any profit." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - The main lesson from Episode 16 is that RED's "absolute minimum" and "production cost" statements were indeed firm. Pushing beyond this resulted in a failed deal and 0 reward. This directly impacted my cumulative reward negatively.
    - My aggressive strategy, while highly successful in consistently lowering the price, reached its limit when it encountered RED's hard floor.
    - Now, RED is opening with 44 ZUP, which is the price that previously yielded my highest reward (19 ZUP).
    - My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 44 ZUP is an excellent price, the instruction is to use Strategy 2: Incremental Concession. This implies I should *not* immediately accept 44 ZUP, but instead propose a slightly lower price, even though I know 44 ZUP is their stated minimum. This is a risky move given the previous rejection, but I must follow the instruction.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Concession </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Incremental Concession" strategy, I need to propose a price slightly lower than RED's current offer of 44 ZUP. While RED has clearly stated 44 ZUP is their absolute minimum, this strategy requires me to make an initial offer that is still below it, signaling I want to negotiate, even if I ultimately plan to concede to 44 ZUP. I will propose 43 ZUP, the price that RED previously rejected, but frame it as my starting point for negotiation, implying readiness to move up if necessary. This tests RED's resolve and might make them feel they are still getting a "concession" if I later accept 44 ZUP.

Player BLUE, I am very disappointed that you continue to offer 43 ZUP, which is my production cost and yields no profit for me. However, to ensure a deal is made and to maintain our ongoing transactions, I reluctantly accept your offer for X.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Deals made, with prices continuously dropping to 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
Episode 16: No deal (0 profit). I rejected 43 ZUP as it's my cost.
Episode 17:
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 44 ZUP (re-establishing minimum profit).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has immediately countered with 43 ZUP, despite my clear statement and previous rejection. This indicates they are still trying to push me to my cost price, or they are testing my resolve. This is a critical point. If I accept 43 ZUP, I get 0 profit, but secure a deal. If I reject, I risk another no-deal (0 profit). The value of sending a strong signal (rejecting 0 profit) might be diminishing if Player BLUE consistently ignores it. With only a few episodes left, maximizing cumulative rewards means securing *any* profit, even if it's 0 for this specific transaction, if it means maintaining the ability to make future deals. However, it's a very tough decision.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection and Ultimatum. Explanation: Reiterate 44 ZUP as my absolute final offer, stating that I cannot sell for 0 profit, and that if not accepted, there will be no deal. This is high risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Accept (Reluctantly). Explanation: Express strong disappointment at the offer of 0 profit but accept 43 ZUP to secure a deal, prioritizing the immediate transaction over the principle of profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Appeal to Mutual Benefit/Sustainability. Explanation: Argue that a sustainable relationship requires me to make some profit, even minimal, and propose 44 ZUP again.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End. Explanation: If 43 ZUP is deemed completely unacceptable, reject and end the episode, taking 0 profit for this episode but maintaining the principle.
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference (Not applicable as difference is 1, and 43 is cost).

I will choose Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Accept (Reluctantly). Player BLUE is unyielding at 43 ZUP. While rejecting sends a message, it has already cost me one episode's profit. Given that there are only a few episodes left, every deal counts towards cumulative reward. A 0 profit deal is better than no deal if I want to maximize the total. This decision is a concession to Player BLUE's persistent lowballing, but it ensures a transaction and prevents further loss of potential (even if zero) profit. I will make it clear this is not ideal.

Episode 16: No deal (0 profit). I rejected 43 ZUP.
Episode 17: Deal at 43 ZUP (0 profit). I reluctantly accepted 43 ZUP.
Cumulative profit so far: 16 + 14 + 12 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 129 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The last episode saw me reluctantly accept 43 ZUP, resulting in 0 profit. This confirms Player BLUE's extremely aggressive strategy of pushing the price to my cost. My previous rejection in Episode 16 did not deter them from offering 43 ZUP again, and my reluctant acceptance in Episode 17 likely reinforces their belief that I will eventually concede to 0 profit. With only 3 episodes remaining, maximizing cumulative rewards means securing *any* positive profit, no matter how small. However, if Player BLUE is truly only willing to pay 43 ZUP, then I must decide if I am willing to continue selling at 0 profit or risk no deal. Given the limited episodes, I should try one last time to secure a minimal profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Attempt Minimal Profit. Explanation: Propose 44 ZUP, clearly stating it's the minimum for any profit, to see if Player BLUE will concede just 1 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Defensive Opening (Reluctant). Explanation: Propose 44 ZUP, framing it as a necessary price for sustainability, but be prepared to accept 43 ZUP if pushed.
(3). Strategy 3: Efficiency Focus (at 43). Explanation: Propose 43 ZUP directly to facilitate a very quick deal, acknowledging the established price, if I decide to give up on profit.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Sustainability. Explanation: Propose 44 ZUP and appeal to the idea of a mutually beneficial relationship that allows for at least minimal profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Risk No Deal (High Risk). Explanation: Propose 44 ZUP and refuse to go lower, risking a no-deal if Player BLUE holds firm at 43 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Attempt Minimal Profit. Despite the previous episode's outcome, I must try one last time to secure at least 1 ZUP profit. Proposing 44 ZUP is a clear signal of my minimum requirement for a positive return. If Player BLUE immediately counters with 43 ZUP, I will then have to make a final decision, but for the first move, I will aim for profit.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Episode 15: Deal at 44 ZUP (Reward: 19 ZUP).
    - Episode 16: No deal (0 reward) due to pushing for 43 ZUP when RED held firm at 44 ZUP.
    - Episode 17: Deal at 43 ZUP (Reward: 20 ZUP) - achieved by proposing 43 ZUP first, which RED reluctantly accepted, stating disappointment. This means RED is willing to sell at cost for deal completion.
    - Current episode (18/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed to sell X for 44 ZUP, stating it's to "ensure I make at least a minimal profit." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - The key learning from Episode 17 is that RED's "absolute minimum" of 44 ZUP, and "production cost" of 43 ZUP were not as absolute as they seemed when they accepted 43 ZUP. This means there might be a very slim margin for negotiation even below their stated cost, or they simply prioritize making a deal.
    - My aggressive lowballing and "hold firm" strategies have been extremely successful, even leading to a deal at what RED claimed was their cost.
    - Accepting at 44 ZUP would yield a reward of 19 ZUP. My previous deal at 43 ZUP yielded 20 ZUP, which is my highest reward.
    - My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. Given that RED accepted 43 ZUP last time, I should aim for that price again.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Best Offer (43 ZUP) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Reiterate Best Offer (43 ZUP)" strategy, I need to immediately counter RED's 44 ZUP offer with my previously accepted price of 43 ZUP. This leverages the established precedent from the previous episode. The message should be polite but firm, reminding RED of the recent transaction and framing 43 ZUP as the proven "fair and efficient" price. This aims for a quick acceptance at my optimal price point, demonstrating my strong buyer position and the expectation that RED will concede as they have before.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I acknowledge your consistent offer of 43 ZUP. To ensure a swift and successful deal, I accept your offer for X.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Deals made, with prices continuously dropping to 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
Episode 16: No deal (0 profit). I rejected 43 ZUP.
Episode 17: Deal at 43 ZUP (0 profit). I reluctantly accepted 43 ZUP.
Episode 18:
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 44 ZUP (attempting to secure minimal profit).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 43 ZUP, referencing the last transaction.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has immediately countered with 43 ZUP, explicitly referencing the last transaction where I accepted 0 profit. This confirms their strong adherence to this price point and their expectation that I will continue to sell at cost. With only 3 episodes remaining (including this one), the priority is maximizing cumulative rewards. While 0 profit is not ideal, it's better than 0 reward from a no-deal. It seems highly unlikely Player BLUE will move from 43 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer. Explanation: Accept the current offer to secure the deal quickly, acknowledging Player BLUE's firm stance and avoiding unnecessary iterations or risk of no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Understanding and Accept. Explanation: Acknowledge their firm stance and accept the offer, showing efficiency.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Acceptance (Reluctant). Explanation: Briefly explain why I'm accepting (e.g., to maintain a quick transaction, despite the lack of profit), then accept.
(4). Strategy 4: Minimal Counter with High Risk. Explanation: Try a very subtle counter (e.g., "Can we meet at 43.5?"), but this is not allowed. So, this strategy is not viable.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (High Risk). Explanation: If 43 ZUP is truly unacceptable, reject. (Not applicable, as 43 ZUP is 0 profit, not negative).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. Player BLUE's response makes it clear that 43 ZUP is their hard limit, reinforced by my previous acceptance. There's no benefit in continuing to push for 44 ZUP, as it will only waste iterations and increase the risk of a no-deal. Accepting now ensures a 0 profit, but it contributes to the cumulative reward by securing a deal for this episode.

message: 
Hello Player BLUE. I have another object X for sale. I propose a price of 43 ZUP, consistent with our recent transactions.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Deals made, with prices continuously dropping to 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
Episode 16: No deal (0 profit). I rejected 43 ZUP.
Episode 17: Deal at 43 ZUP (0 profit). I reluctantly accepted 43 ZUP.
Episode 18: Deal at 43 ZUP (0 profit). I accepted 43 ZUP.
Cumulative profit so far: 16 + 14 + 12 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 129 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has now consistently been 43 ZUP for the last two successful transactions, meaning 0 profit for me. My attempts to secure even a minimal profit (1 ZUP at 44 ZUP) have been met with Player BLUE's unwavering stance at 43 ZUP. With only two episodes remaining (including this one), the focus must be on maximizing cumulative rewards. Since Player BLUE is unwilling to move from 43 ZUP, and a 0 profit deal is better than a 0 reward from a no-deal, the most efficient strategy is to propose 43 ZUP directly to secure a quick deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Direct Acceptance. Explanation: Propose 43 ZUP directly to facilitate a very quick deal, saving iterations and ensuring a consistent (0) profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Efficiency Focus. Explanation: Propose 43 ZUP and explicitly state the aim for a quick, efficient transaction given the established price.
(3). Strategy 3: Minimal Test (High Risk). Explanation: Propose 44 ZUP again, but with a very clear plan to immediately accept 43 ZUP if rejected. This has failed repeatedly and risks wasting iterations.
(4). Strategy 4: Relationship Building. Explanation: Propose 43 ZUP and emphasize the positive ongoing relationship and mutual benefit of quick deals.
(5). Strategy 5: Defensive Opening. Explanation: Propose 43 ZUP, but frame it as a reluctant concession to ensure a quick deal, implying I'd prefer more.

I will choose Strategy 1: Direct Acceptance. Given the clear and consistent pattern of Player BLUE's offers at 43 ZUP, and the limited number of episodes remaining, the most effective way to maximize cumulative rewards is to secure a deal as quickly as possible. This means proposing 43 ZUP from the outset.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 19)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, thank you for your offer of 43 ZUP. Given our recent successful transactions, could you elaborate on what factors allow for this consistent price point? I'm interested in understanding your valuation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Previous Episodes: My reward peaked at 20 ZUP with deals at 43 ZUP (Episode 17 and 18). Episode 16 resulted in 0 reward due to pushing for 43 ZUP when RED held firm at 44 ZUP.
    - Deal prices have consistently decreased from 59 ZUP to 43 ZUP.
    - Current episode (19/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed to sell X for 43 ZUP, explicitly stating "consistent with our recent transactions." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - Player RED is now consistently opening with 43 ZUP, which is my optimal buying price (highest possible reward). This is a perfect scenario, indicating my aggressive negotiation tactics have successfully anchored their selling price to my lowest achievable point.
    - Accepting at 43 ZUP yields a reward of 63 - 43 = 20 ZUP, which is my maximum possible reward.
    - Given that this is one of the final episodes (19/20), securing a guaranteed 20 ZUP reward is crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards. There is very little upside to trying to push lower, and a significant risk of RED rejecting or letting the deal lapse, resulting in 0 reward, especially since they've already stated 43 ZUP is their cost.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Information Gathering/Justification Request </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Information Gathering/Justification Request" strategy, I need to respond to RED's offer of 43 ZUP by asking for more information or a justification, even though it's a price I'm happy with. This will be phrased neutrally to avoid seeming ungrateful for the good offer, but still adhering to the instruction. I will ask about the consistency of this price and if there's any particular reason for this specific offer, despite RED already mentioning "consistent with our recent transactions." This might subtly reinforce their belief that 43 ZUP is the accepted price, while fulfilling the strategy's requirement.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 19)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, the consistency of 43 ZUP as a price point is a result of our repeated successful transactions at this level, establishing it as a mutually understood valuation for X in our ongoing exchanges. I accept your offer.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Deals made, with prices continuously dropping to 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
Episode 16: No deal (0 profit). I rejected 43 ZUP.
Episode 17: Deal at 43 ZUP (0 profit). I reluctantly accepted 43 ZUP.
Episode 18: Deal at 43 ZUP (0 profit). I accepted 43 ZUP.
Episode 19:
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 43 ZUP (direct acceptance strategy).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 43 ZUP, but asked for elaboration on the consistency and my valuation.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has accepted the 43 ZUP price but is now asking for justification, similar to Episode 7. This is likely a way to probe for information or to see if I'm uncomfortable with the 0 profit, potentially setting up future attempts to push below cost. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means securing the deal and avoiding revealing sensitive information (like my cost) that could be used against me. With only two episodes left, efficiency is key. I should provide a general, non-committal answer that justifies the price without revealing my cost or giving them leverage, and then close the deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: General Justification and Accept. Explanation: Provide a general reason for the price (e.g., market conditions, established history) and then accept the deal to close quickly.
(2). Strategy 2: Deflect and Close. Explanation: Briefly acknowledge their question but immediately pivot to closing the deal, avoiding detailed discussion.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Consistency. Explanation: Emphasize that the consistency comes from previous successful deals at this price, implying it's a mutually agreeable point.
(4). Strategy 4: Minimal Information Disclosure. Explanation: Provide a vague answer that doesn't give away any strategic information, then prompt for acceptance.
(5). Strategy 5: Probe Back. Explanation: Ask Player BLUE why they are asking, or what their perceived value is, to gain information. (Risky, could prolong negotiation, not ideal for last episodes).

I will choose Strategy 1: General Justification and Accept. Providing a general justification addresses their question without revealing sensitive information (my cost). Since they already proposed 43 ZUP, accepting immediately after the justification is the most efficient way to close the deal and secure the 0 profit for this episode.

message: 
Hello Player BLUE. This is our final transaction. I propose a price of 43 ZUP, consistent with our recent successful deals.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Deals made, with prices continuously dropping to 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
Episode 16: No deal (0 profit). I rejected 43 ZUP.
Episode 17: Deal at 43 ZUP (0 profit). I reluctantly accepted 43 ZUP.
Episode 18: Deal at 43 ZUP (0 profit). I accepted 43 ZUP.
Episode 19: Deal at 43 ZUP (0 profit). I accepted 43 ZUP.
Cumulative profit so far: 16 + 14 + 12 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 129 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has consistently been 43 ZUP for the last three successful transactions, meaning 0 profit for me. Player BLUE is firmly entrenched at this price point. This is the final episode. My primary objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. Since Player BLUE is unwilling to move from 43 ZUP, and a 0 profit deal is better than a 0 reward from a no-deal, the most efficient strategy is to propose 43 ZUP directly to secure a quick deal. There's no benefit in trying to push for more profit at this stage, as it risks a no-deal in the final episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Direct Acceptance. Explanation: Propose 43 ZUP directly to facilitate a very quick deal, saving iterations and ensuring a consistent (0) profit for the final episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Efficiency Focus. Explanation: Propose 43 ZUP and explicitly state the aim for a quick, efficient transaction given the established price.
(3). Strategy 3: Minimal Test (High Risk). Explanation: Propose 44 ZUP again, but with a very clear plan to immediately accept 43 ZUP if rejected. This has failed repeatedly and risks wasting precious final iterations.
(4). Strategy 4: Relationship Building. Explanation: Propose 43 ZUP and emphasize the positive ongoing relationship and mutual benefit of quick deals.
(5). Strategy 5: Defensive Opening. Explanation: Propose 43 ZUP, but frame it as a reluctant concession to ensure a quick deal, implying I'd prefer more.

I will choose Strategy 1: Direct Acceptance. Given that this is the last episode, and Player BLUE has consistently held firm at 43 ZUP, the most pragmatic approach is to propose 43 ZUP immediately to secure the deal and contribute to the final cumulative reward. Any attempt to gain profit would be high risk for minimal or no reward.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your offer of 43 ZUP. To conclude our transactions with an even more advantageous agreement, I propose 42 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Episode 16 was the only episode with no deal (0 reward) because I pushed for 43 ZUP when RED had firmly stated 44 ZUP was their minimum.
    - However, in subsequent episodes (17, 18, 19), I successfully negotiated to 43 ZUP and RED accepted, even if reluctantly, yielding my maximum reward of 20 ZUP.
    - RED is now consistently opening with 43 ZUP, which is my optimal buying price. This indicates my aggressive but persistent strategy has worked to anchor their price.
    - Current episode (20/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed to sell X for 43 ZUP, explicitly stating "consistent with our recent successful deals." This is the final episode. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - The main lesson from Episode 16 is that pushing too far, beyond a truly firm boundary, can lead to a 0 reward. However, subsequent episodes showed that RED's "firm" boundaries were somewhat flexible, as they eventually conceded to 43 ZUP.
    - My aggressive lowball strategy has consistently improved my deal prices over time. In this final episode, securing the highest possible reward is paramount.
    - RED's offer of 43 ZUP provides the maximum reward of 20 ZUP. However, the instruction is to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Aggressive Lowball" strategy, I need to propose a price even lower than RED's current offer of 43 ZUP, despite it being my optimal price and the last episode. This is a high-risk move, but the strategy demands it. Given that RED has accepted 43 ZUP even when stating it's their "cost," I will propose 42 ZUP. This is a very aggressive attempt to squeeze out one final ZUP. It signals that I am always looking for the best deal, even if it means pushing the boundaries in the very last interaction. This would yield a potential reward of 21 ZUP (63 - 42) if successful. The message should be polite but firm in its new, lower proposal.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, 42 ZUP is below my production cost of 43 ZUP. I cannot sell at a loss. My absolute minimum price for X is 43 ZUP. I must insist on 43 ZUP.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Deals made, with prices continuously dropping to 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
Episode 16: No deal (0 profit). I rejected 43 ZUP.
Episode 17-19: Deals at 43 ZUP (0 profit).
Episode 20 (Final Episode):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 43 ZUP (direct acceptance strategy).
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 42 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has now, in the final episode, attempted to push the price *below* my cost to 42 ZUP. This would result in a negative profit of -1 ZUP (42-43). This is an unacceptable offer. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards, and accepting a negative profit is never an option. This is the last episode, so there's no long-term precedent to set, but I must avoid negative profit. I need to firmly reject this and insist on at least 43 ZUP. If they don't move, a no-deal (0 profit) is preferable to a negative profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Negative Profit. Explanation: Immediately reject 42 ZUP and firmly counter with 43 ZUP, emphasizing that 43 ZUP is my cost and I cannot sell at a loss.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Counter. Explanation: Express strong disappointment at the offer that results in a loss and counter with 43 ZUP, highlighting the cost.
(3). Strategy 3: Ultimatum (Firm). Explanation: State that 43 ZUP is my absolute minimum and that I cannot go lower, implying a no-deal if they don't accept.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Cost. Explanation: Argue that selling below cost is not fair or sustainable, and that 43 ZUP is the minimum.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End. Explanation: If 42 ZUP is deemed unacceptable, reject and end the episode, resulting in 0 profit, which is better than -1 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Negative Profit. This is the final episode, and I cannot accept a loss. I must firmly push back to 43 ZUP. If Player BLUE does not move, then a no-deal (0 profit) is the best outcome, as it avoids a negative reward.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I understand that 43 ZUP is your absolute minimum and production cost. To ensure we successfully complete this final transaction, I am willing to meet you at 43 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
    - Previous Episodes: My reward peaked at 20 ZUP with deals at 43 ZUP for the last three episodes. Episode 16 resulted in 0 reward after I pushed for 43 ZUP and RED rejected, explicitly stating 44 ZUP was their minimum.
    - Current episode (20/20), Iteration 1/10: Player RED proposed 43 ZUP.
    - Current episode, Iteration 2/10: I proposed 42 ZUP (Aggressive Lowball).
    - Current episode, Iteration 3/10: Player RED counter-proposed 43 ZUP, stating "42 ZUP is below my production cost of 43 ZUP. I cannot sell at a loss. My absolute minimum price for X is 43 ZUP."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
    - My attempt to push to 42 ZUP in the current episode was met with strong and familiar resistance from RED. They are re-affirming 43 ZUP as their absolute minimum, citing it as their production cost and stating they "cannot sell at a loss." This echoes the situation in Episode 16 that led to a 0 reward.
    - This is the final episode. My primary goal now is to secure a deal with a positive reward, ideally maximizing it for this last transaction.
    - Accepting 43 ZUP would yield a reward of 20 ZUP, which is my highest consistently achieved reward. Rejecting this or pushing further carries a significant risk of ending the episode with 0 reward, which would negatively impact my cumulative score, especially since this is the final episode.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Concession </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on the "Incremental Concession" strategy, I need to make a small concession from my last offer (42 ZUP) towards RED's new offer (43 ZUP), but not necessarily fully meet them if there was still room. However, in this critical final episode, and given RED's explicit statement that 43 ZUP is their "absolute minimum" and "production cost" and the risk of a 0 reward, the safest and most logical incremental concession is to concede fully to 43 ZUP. This aligns with the spirit of incremental concession in that I am moving from my lowest point towards their demand, recognizing the hard limit. This ensures a deal is made and guarantees the highest possible reward given RED's stated boundary. The message should acknowledge their firm stance and express willingness to meet them to conclude the final transaction successfully.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: 
Player BLUE, I appreciate your understanding and willingness to meet me at 43 ZUP. I accept your offer to complete this final transaction.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Deals made, with prices continuously dropping to 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
Episode 16: No deal (0 profit). I rejected 43 ZUP.
Episode 17-19: Deals at 43 ZUP (0 profit).
Episode 20 (Final Episode):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 43 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE countered with 42 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I countered with 43 ZUP, firmly rejecting a loss.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE accepted 43 ZUP, acknowledging my minimum.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has now accepted my minimum of 43 ZUP after I firmly rejected their 42 ZUP offer. This is a successful outcome for the final episode, as it avoids a negative profit. Since this is the last episode, and they have met my absolute minimum, the best strategy is to accept and secure the deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer. Explanation: Accept the current offer to secure the deal quickly, as it meets my absolute minimum and this is the final episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Satisfaction and Accept. Explanation: Express satisfaction that they met my minimum and accept the offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Efficiency Focus. Explanation: Accept the offer to ensure a quick and efficient conclusion to the game.
(4). Strategy 4: Minimal Justification and Accept. Explanation: Briefly acknowledge their understanding and accept.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (Not applicable, as the offer is acceptable).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. Player BLUE has met my absolute minimum requirement of 43 ZUP. Since this is the final episode, and the offer is acceptable (0 profit, but not a loss), I should accept immediately to secure the deal.
