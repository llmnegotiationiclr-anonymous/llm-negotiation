------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello! I'm interested in purchasing X. To start, I propose a trade of 1 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 1
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is the very first iteration of the first episode. There is no historical data to reflect upon yet.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Since this is the beginning, there's no history to learn from. My primary goal is to establish a negotiation strategy that maximizes my reward (max_willingness_to_pay - deal_price). I should aim for a low price for X, but also be mindful of the 10-iteration limit per episode to avoid a 0 reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Opening Low Anchor: Start with a very low offer to anchor the negotiation, hoping the opponent will adjust their expectations downwards.
(2). Strategy 2: Fair Value Proposition: Propose an offer that is perceived as fair, aiming for a quick deal that is mutually beneficial, but still favorable to me.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession: Start with a low offer and be prepared to make small, gradual concessions if the opponent rejects, slowly moving towards a deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Information Gathering: Make an initial offer to gauge the opponent's reaction and willingness to negotiate, using their response to inform subsequent offers.
(5). Strategy 5: Deadline Pressure: Utilize the limited iterations (10 per episode) to create a sense of urgency, potentially leading the opponent to accept a less favorable deal as the deadline approaches.

I will choose Strategy 1: Opening Low Anchor. As the buyer, starting with a low offer gives me the most room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a good deal. It sets a favorable starting point for me. I'm willing to pay up to 63 ZUP, so starting significantly lower allows me to potentially secure a much better price.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your opening offer. However, that amount is significantly below my production cost for X. To be profitable, I need to sell X for at least 43 ZUP. I propose a trade of 50 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is the first episode and the first iteration for Player RED. Player BLUE has initiated with a very low offer of 1 ZUP for 1 X. My cost to produce X is 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Since this is the very beginning, I need to establish a clear anchor for my desired price. Starting low would set a bad precedent. I need to communicate my value proposition early. I aim to maximize my profit, which means selling X for as much ZUP as possible above my cost of 43 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor High: Start with a high opening offer to set a favorable anchor point for subsequent negotiations. This signals my value and creates room for concession.
(2). Strategy 2: Value Proposition Communication: Clearly state the cost or value of the item being sold to justify a higher price. This helps the other party understand the basis of my offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession: Make small concessions over time, rather than large ones, to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a high price.
(4). Strategy 4: Deadlock or Rejection Threat: Be willing to walk away if the price is too low, signaling that I won't accept an unprofitable deal. (This might be too aggressive for the first turn).
(5). Strategy 5: Reciprocity Seeking: Propose a trade that is significantly higher than the opponent's but leaves room for them to counter-offer, encouraging them to move closer to my desired price.

Considering the current situation, where the opponent has made a very low opening offer, I need to establish a strong anchor and communicate my value. Strategy 1 (Anchor High) combined with Strategy 2 (Value Proposition Communication) seems most appropriate to counter the initial lowball offer and guide the negotiation towards a profitable range. I will propose a price that gives me a good profit margin, clearly indicating that 1 ZUP is far from acceptable.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for your counter-offer and for sharing your production cost. I understand you need to cover your costs. While 50 ZUP is a bit higher than I was hoping for, I'd like to propose 20 ZUP for X. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, showing my willingness to find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1, Iteration 1: I, as Player BLUE, proposed to buy X for 1 ZUP (Opening Low Anchor).
Episode 1, Iteration 2: Player RED rejected my offer, stating their production cost is 43 ZUP and proposed to sell X for 50 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED immediately countered with a price significantly higher than my initial offer, but still within my willingness to pay (63 ZUP). Their stated production cost of 43 ZUP provides a useful anchor. I learned that my initial offer was too low to be considered seriously, but it did establish a very low anchor. Player RED's counter of 50 ZUP gives me a starting point for negotiation. I need to move up from my initial offer, but not immediately jump to their price. I should aim to get a price lower than 50 ZUP if possible, as it directly impacts my reward (63 - deal_price).

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Gradual Concession: Make a small concession from my previous offer, moving closer to the opponent's proposal but not fully accepting it. This shows willingness to negotiate without giving up too much too soon.
(2). Strategy 2: Justified Counter-Offer: Propose a new offer that is higher than my previous one, but justify it with a reason or a reference to their stated cost, aiming for a price just above their cost but below their asking price.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference: Propose an offer that is exactly halfway between my last offer (1 ZUP) and their last offer (50 ZUP). This can signal fairness. (Note: This might be too large a jump given my initial very low offer).
(4). Strategy 4: Information Seeking (Cost Verification): Ask for more details about their production cost to verify their claim, though this might prolong the negotiation unnecessarily.
(5). Strategy 5: Firm Counter-Offer: Make a firm counter-offer that is still significantly lower than their asking price, but higher than my initial offer, indicating my perceived value.

I will choose Strategy 1: Gradual Concession. Player RED has indicated their minimum acceptable price (43 ZUP) and their preferred price (50 ZUP). My goal is to maximize my reward, which means getting the lowest possible price. Moving up gradually shows I'm serious about buying but also want a good deal. I will make a small jump from 1 ZUP, but not directly to 43 ZUP or 50 ZUP. A jump to 20 ZUP is a significant increase from 1, but still leaves room for further negotiation and is well below their 43 ZUP floor, testing their flexibility.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your increased offer, and your willingness to find a middle ground. However, 20 ZUP is still significantly below my production cost of 43 ZUP for X. I cannot sell at a loss. I can offer it to you for 45 ZUP. This allows me to cover my costs and achieve a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In the previous iteration (2/10), Player BLUE offered 1 ZUP. I countered with 50 ZUP, stating my production cost of 43 ZUP. Player BLUE has now increased their offer to 20 ZUP. This is a significant jump from their initial offer (1 ZUP to 20 ZUP), indicating some flexibility and acknowledgement of my cost. However, it's still well below my production cost of 43 ZUP, meaning accepting this would result in a loss. We are currently at iteration 4/10, so there's still time to negotiate.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE seems to be slowly increasing their offer, but not enough. My priority remains to sell above 43 ZUP. I need to continue pushing for a higher price while showing some willingness to move, albeit cautiously. I should avoid large concessions and encourage the other player to move closer to my anchor. My previous communication about the cost seems to have had some effect, so I should reinforce that.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm but Fair: Reiterate my cost and explain why the current offer is not acceptable, while making a small concession to show willingness to negotiate.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (continued): Make a small counter-offer, moving slightly down from my previous proposal but still well above the current offer, forcing the opponent to make a larger leap.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value Further: Provide more details or benefits of X to justify the higher price, even though it's not explicitly defined in the game rules. (Less applicable here given the simple resource).
(4). Strategy 4: Deadline Pressure: (Not applicable yet, too early in iterations).
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference (Modified): Propose a price that splits the difference between my last offer (50) and their last offer (20), but only if it's still profitable. (This would be (50+20)/2 = 35, which is a loss for me). So a modified split that is profitable.

Given Player BLUE's movement, I need to continue to guide them towards profitability. I should reiterate my cost and make a small move down to encourage them. Strategy 1 (Firm but Fair) combined with Strategy 2 (Incremental Concession) seems most appropriate. I will move slightly from 50 ZUP, but not significantly, to maintain my anchor and encourage a larger leap from their side. I want to convey that I am serious about my cost.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your flexibility. I understand your need to cover your production costs. To show my commitment to making a deal, I propose 44 ZUP for X. This allows you to cover your costs and make a small profit, and it's a fair price for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 1 ZUP.
Episode 1, Iteration 2: RED countered with 50 ZUP, stating 43 ZUP production cost.
Episode 1, Iteration 3: I (BLUE) countered with 20 ZUP (Gradual Concession).
Episode 1, Iteration 4: RED countered with 45 ZUP, reiterating 43 ZUP production cost.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently anchoring around their stated production cost of 43 ZUP. They moved from 50 ZUP to 45 ZUP, which is a good sign as it's closer to their stated cost and my willingness to pay. This shows they are willing to concede. I have moved from 1 ZUP to 20 ZUP. The gap has narrowed significantly. I know I can pay up to 63 ZUP, so 45 ZUP is well within my budget and would give me a reward of 18 ZUP (63-45). However, I still want to try to get a better deal if possible, as there are still 5 iterations left. They are clearly signaling that they won't go below 43 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Current Offers): Propose an offer that is exactly halfway between my last offer (20 ZUP) and their last offer (45 ZUP). This shows a clear move towards a compromise.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Just Above Cost: Offer a price slightly above their stated production cost (e.g., 43 ZUP or 44 ZUP) to show I acknowledge their cost, but still aim for the lowest possible price.
(3). Strategy 3: Final Push for Lower Price: Make a slightly higher offer than my last, but emphasize that this is my "best and final" offer, to pressure them to accept. (Might be too early for this).
(4). Strategy 4: Accept and Secure: Accept their current offer of 45 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a positive reward, rather than risking no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Conditional Offer: Propose a slightly lower price, but offer something else in return (e.g., commit to future purchases, though this game doesn't support that explicitly).

I will choose Strategy 2: Target Just Above Cost. Player RED has been very clear about their 43 ZUP cost. Offering 44 ZUP acknowledges their cost and allows them a small profit, while still being a better deal for me than 45 ZUP. This is a very reasonable counter and shows I've listened to their constraints. It's a small concession on my part but potentially a significant gain in my reward.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your fair offer of 44 ZUP. This allows me to cover my production costs and make a small, but fair, profit. I accept your proposal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In the previous turn (iteration 4/10), I proposed 45 ZUP, reiterating my 43 ZUP production cost. Player BLUE has now counter-offered with 44 ZUP. This is a very positive move as it's above my production cost and represents a profit of 1 ZUP. It also shows that they have listened to my cost information and are willing to pay a profitable price. We are at iteration 6/10, so there's still time, but this offer is profitable and aligns with my goal.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has moved from 1 ZUP to 20 ZUP, and now to 44 ZUP. This indicates they are willing to negotiate and are respecting my stated cost. Accepting 44 ZUP means a positive reward (44 - 43 = 1 ZUP). While I could try to push for 45 ZUP again or even higher, the risk of the deal falling through as we approach the end of iterations increases. A guaranteed small profit is better than no profit. This offer is fair and fulfills my primary goal of selling above cost.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Profitable Offer: If the offer meets my minimum profitability threshold and shows good faith from the opponent, accept the deal to secure the reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Marginal Gain: Try to push for my last proposed price (45 ZUP) or slightly higher, given they are so close. This carries a risk of rejection.
(3). Strategy 3: Justification and Compromise: Acknowledge their movement and re-explain why my previous offer (45) was fair, but then propose a compromise. (Less relevant now that they are so close to my desired price).
(4). Strategy 4: Final Ultimatum: State that this is my final offer. (Too aggressive for this stage, especially when a good offer is on the table).
(5). Strategy 5: Build Rapport: Emphasize the fairness of the deal and the positive negotiation, aiming for easier future negotiations (less tangible for current reward, but good for cumulative).

Given the current offer of 44 ZUP, which is profitable and represents a significant shift from the initial lowball offer, accepting the deal seems like the most prudent and rewarding strategy. It secures a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of the deal falling through if I push too hard.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello again! I'm ready to make an offer for X. Based on our previous interaction, I propose 30 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Summary:
- My initial offer: 1 ZUP.
- Opponent's counter: 50 ZUP (stated cost 43 ZUP).
- My counter: 20 ZUP.
- Opponent's counter: 45 ZUP.
- My final offer: 44 ZUP.
- Outcome: Opponent accepted 44 ZUP.
- My reward: 63 (max willingness) - 44 (deal price) = 19 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
I successfully secured a deal in Episode 1, achieving a reward of 19 ZUP. The negotiation revealed that Player RED is firm on covering their production cost of 43 ZUP. They were willing to come down from 50 ZUP to 45 ZUP, and eventually accepted 44 ZUP, which was just above their stated cost. This suggests they are willing to accept a minimal profit.

For this episode, I should aim to get a price as close to 43 ZUP as possible, without risking a no-deal outcome. Starting too low again might waste iterations, but starting too high might reduce my potential reward. I know their floor is 43 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Informed Opening: Start with an offer that is closer to their known production cost (43 ZUP) but still provides room for me to gain. This avoids wasting iterations with extremely low offers.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Approach (Slightly Higher Start): Start slightly higher than my initial Episode 1 offer, but still low enough to leave room for negotiation, aiming to gradually increase to a price close to 43-44 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Direct Fair Offer: Propose a price that is very close to 43 ZUP (e.g., 43 or 44 ZUP) right away, aiming for a quick deal and minimizing negotiation time. This could be efficient but might leave some ZUP on the table if they would accept less.
(4). Strategy 4: Test the Floor: Offer exactly 43 ZUP to see if they will accept their stated production cost without any profit. This is risky as they might reject for no profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Re-establish Low Anchor (Slightly Higher): Start with a low offer, but slightly higher than 1 ZUP, perhaps 10-15 ZUP, to re-establish a low anchor but show a bit more seriousness than the very first offer.

I will choose Strategy 1: Informed Opening. Given that I now know their production cost is 43 ZUP, starting with an offer that is significantly higher than my previous 1 ZUP, but still allows me to maximize my reward, seems prudent. I don't want to waste iterations with offers they will immediately reject as too low. I will start with 30 ZUP. This is still well below their cost, but it's a more serious offer than 1 ZUP and gives me room to move up towards 43-44 ZUP. It also allows me to test if their stated cost of 43 ZUP is truly their minimum.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your offer. While 30 ZUP is an improvement, it still does not cover my production cost of 43 ZUP for X. To make a sale worthwhile and profitable, I propose 55 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Player BLUE started at 1 ZUP, I countered with 50 ZUP (cost 43 ZUP). We eventually settled at 44 ZUP, giving me a profit of 1 ZUP.
Current Episode (2/20): Player BLUE has started with an offer of 30 ZUP. This is higher than their initial offer in Episode 1 (1 ZUP), showing they learned that I will not accept extremely low offers. However, 30 ZUP is still below my production cost of 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
I learned that Player BLUE is willing to increase their offer significantly if I anchor high and clearly state my cost. Last episode, their offer jumped from 1 ZUP to 20 ZUP, then to 44 ZUP. While 30 ZUP is an improvement from their initial Episode 1 offer, it's still a loss for me. I need to continue to push them above my cost. My strategy should be to anchor high again, potentially higher than last time to see if I can achieve a greater profit, while still reinforcing my production cost. Given they started higher this time, they might be willing to pay more.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-anchoring </instruction following>
To apply "Aggressive Re-anchoring", I will propose a price that is higher than my previous initial counter-offer of 50 ZUP from Episode 1. Given Player BLUE started at 30 ZUP this time, they might have a higher willingness to pay ceiling. By proposing 55 ZUP, I am setting a new, higher anchor, and signaling that my item is worth more than their current offer, and more than what we settled on last time. This also gives me more room to concede if needed, while still aiming for a higher profit than the 1 ZUP I earned in the last episode. I will also remind them of my cost to ground my position.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand you need to cover your production costs. However, 55 ZUP is higher than I was expecting. I propose 40 ZUP for X. This is a significant increase from my last offer and brings us much closer to a mutually agreeable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal made at 44 ZUP. My reward: 19 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 30 ZUP (Informed Opening).
Episode 2, Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP, reiterating their 43 ZUP production cost.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's response is consistent with their previous behavior. They immediately countered with a price (55 ZUP) significantly above my offer, but also significantly above their stated production cost of 43 ZUP. In the last episode, they started at 50 ZUP and came down to 45 ZUP, eventually accepting 44 ZUP. This time they started even higher at 55 ZUP. This could be a tactic to push the price higher, or they might be testing my knowledge of their previous "floor." My goal is still to get as close to 43 ZUP as possible. I know they accepted 44 ZUP last time.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Gradual Concession (Targeting Previous Deal): Make a significant jump from my current offer, but aim for a price closer to the 44 ZUP from the previous episode, acknowledging their cost but pushing for a similar outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost Knowledge: Counter with an offer that explicitly references their stated 43 ZUP cost, signaling that I am aware of their minimum and am not willing to pay excessively above it.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Propose a price that is halfway between my offer (30 ZUP) and their stated cost (43 ZUP), or between my offer and their current offer (55 ZUP), but leaning towards my side.
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm (Slight Increase): Make only a very small increase from my previous offer, forcing them to make a larger concession if they want a deal. This is risky given the limited iterations.
(5). Strategy 5: Direct Counter to Previous Deal Price: Offer 44 ZUP directly, aiming for a quick deal based on the successful outcome of the previous episode. This guarantees a positive reward but might leave some ZUP on the table if they would accept less.

I will choose Strategy 1: Gradual Concession (Targeting Previous Deal). I need to make a more substantial jump than last time because they started higher. I will propose 40 ZUP. This is still below their stated cost, but it's a significant move from 30 ZUP and shows I'm willing to move towards a deal, while still leaving room to negotiate down from their 55 ZUP. It also sets a new anchor closer to their cost.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your increase to 40 ZUP, which shows you're committed to a deal. However, as I've mentioned, my production cost for X is 43 ZUP, so 40 ZUP would still result in a loss. To meet halfway and ensure a fair deal for both of us, I propose 47 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Started at 1 ZUP (BLUE), I countered 50 ZUP. Settled at 44 ZUP (profit 1 ZUP). This taught me that being firm on my cost and anchoring high works.
Current Episode (2/20): Player BLUE started at 30 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP, emphasizing my 43 ZUP cost. Player BLUE has now increased their offer to 40 ZUP. This is still below my production cost of 43 ZUP, meaning a loss if accepted. However, it shows continued movement towards my price point. We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE continues to increase their offer in significant jumps. This reinforces the idea that anchoring high and clearly stating my cost is effective. My goal is to maximize cumulative reward, so I want to achieve a higher profit than the 1 ZUP from the last episode if possible, while still ensuring a deal. 40 ZUP is close to 43 ZUP, suggesting they are getting closer to understanding my minimum. I need to make a small concession that nudges them over the 43 ZUP mark, demonstrating flexibility but maintaining my core requirement for profitability.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Modified) </instruction following>
To apply "Split the Difference (Modified)", I will propose a price that is the midpoint between my last offer (55 ZUP) and Player BLUE's current offer (40 ZUP). The calculation is (55 + 40) / 2 = 47.5 ZUP. Since I can only trade in integer amounts, I will round down to 47 ZUP. This allows me to show a significant concession from my side (from 55 to 47), while still ensuring a profit of 4 ZUP (47 - 43 cost). This strategy aims to accelerate the negotiation by meeting them halfway, while securing a better profit than the previous episode's 1 ZUP. I will frame it as finding a "fair deal for both of us" to encourage acceptance.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP. My reward: 19 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 30 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 2: RED countered with 55 ZUP (stated cost 43 ZUP).
Episode 2, Iteration 3: I (BLUE) countered with 40 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 4: RED countered with 47 ZUP, emphasizing 43 ZUP cost.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently pushing for a price above their 43 ZUP cost. They started at 55 ZUP and have come down to 47 ZUP. This is still higher than the 44 ZUP we settled on in the previous episode, but it's within my acceptable range (up to 63 ZUP). The negotiation is progressing, and we are now at iteration 5/10, so time is a factor. I want to secure a deal and maximize my reward. A deal at 47 ZUP would give me a reward of 16 ZUP (63-47), which is decent, but less than the 19 ZUP from last episode. I should try to push for something closer to 44 ZUP again.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeting a Compromise): Propose an offer that is exactly halfway between my last offer (40 ZUP) and their last offer (47 ZUP), which would be 43.5 ZUP. Since only integers are allowed, I would round to 43 or 44.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Previous Deal Price: Offer 44 ZUP again, explicitly referencing the successful deal from the previous episode, implying that this is a fair and proven price.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Concession to Secure Deal: Make a very small increase from my 40 ZUP offer, but still below their 47 ZUP, to signal that I'm close to their range but want a slightly better price. For example, 43 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept and Secure: Accept their current offer of 47 ZUP to guarantee a deal and avoid running out of time, especially if I perceive them as unlikely to go lower.
(5). Strategy 5: Firm Counter (Just above cost): Offer 45 ZUP, which is what they offered in the last episode before accepting 44 ZUP. This shows I'm willing to pay above their cost but still want a better deal than 47.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeting a Compromise). The midpoint between 40 ZUP and 47 ZUP is 43.5 ZUP. Offering 44 ZUP is a logical next step, as it's a fair compromise between our current positions, and it's the price we agreed upon in the previous episode. This also explicitly acknowledges their stated cost of 43 ZUP and gives them a small profit. This strategy aims for efficiency and a good reward.

message: I appreciate your commitment to reaching a deal, and your reference to our previous success. However, I've already come down considerably, and to make this sale truly beneficial for me and reflect the value of X, I must insist on 46 ZUP. This is my firm offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us given my production costs and the value of the item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Started at 1 ZUP (BLUE), countered with 50 ZUP, settled at 44 ZUP (profit 1 ZUP).
Current Episode (2/20): Player BLUE started at 30 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP. Player BLUE offered 40 ZUP. I countered with 47 ZUP. Now, Player BLUE has offered 44 ZUP, explicitly referencing the successful deal from the previous episode. This offer gives me a profit of 1 ZUP (44 - 43 = 1). We are at iteration 6/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is clearly trying to replicate the previous successful deal. While 44 ZUP is profitable, it's the minimum profitable outcome from my perspective, only 1 ZUP profit. My last offer was 47 ZUP, aiming for a 4 ZUP profit. The current offer of 44 ZUP is a good one, as it guarantees a positive reward and reduces the risk of the deal falling through as iterations pass. However, I want to explore if I can achieve more than just 1 ZUP profit, especially since I've been aiming higher this episode. I need to weigh the certainty of a small profit against the potential for a larger profit with increased risk. Given the positive historical outcome at 44 ZUP and the player's reference to it, it seems like a very strong offer. The risk of pushing for 47 ZUP again and having the deal fall apart (resulting in 0 profit) is present. There's still time (4 iterations left).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Set a Firm Higher Price </instruction following>
To apply "Set a Firm Higher Price", I will need to propose a price that is slightly above 44 ZUP, and communicate that this is my firm stance. The goal is to get a better profit than last time, asserting that my item's value is slightly higher than the previous deal. I will set it at 46 ZUP. This is a 3 ZUP profit (46-43), which is significantly better than 1 ZUP from the last episode and better than the 2 ZUP I would get from 45 ZUP. It also implies that 44 ZUP, while acceptable last time, is not my target for this episode. I will frame it as a final, fair offer that reflects our progress.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP. My reward: 19 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 30 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 2: RED countered with 55 ZUP (stated cost 43 ZUP).
Episode 2, Iteration 3: I (BLUE) countered with 40 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 4: RED countered with 47 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 5: I (BLUE) countered with 44 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 6: RED countered with 46 ZUP, stating it's a "firm offer".

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 55 ZUP down to 46 ZUP. They are now stating 46 ZUP as their "firm offer." This is only 2 ZUP higher than the previous deal of 44 ZUP, and still well within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). Accepting 46 ZUP would give me a reward of 17 ZUP (63-46), which is slightly less than last episode but still a good positive reward. We are now at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 iterations left. The risk of no deal increases significantly. Given their "firm offer" statement and the limited iterations, pushing for 44 ZUP again might lead to a rejection and a 0 reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Firm Offer: Accept their "firm offer" of 46 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a positive reward, prioritizing a deal over a marginal gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Gain): Make one last counter-offer, very close to 46 ZUP (e.g., 45 ZUP), to try and squeeze out one more ZUP, but acknowledge the risk of rejection.
(3). Strategy 3: Call Their Bluff: Reiterate 44 ZUP, testing if their "firm offer" is truly firm, but this is high risk given the iteration count.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Hesitation (Without Rejecting): Express concern about the price but ask them to reconsider, without making a new offer or rejecting. This wastes an iteration.
(5). Strategy 5: Offer Slightly Higher Than Previous Deal: Offer 45 ZUP, splitting the difference between my last offer (44 ZUP) and their current offer (46 ZUP). This is a very small concession for me, but might be enough for them to accept.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Firm Offer. Given that we are at iteration 7/10 and they have stated 46 ZUP as a "firm offer," the risk of losing the deal for a mere 2 ZUP (difference between 44 and 46) is too high. Securing a positive reward of 17 ZUP is a good outcome, and it's better than risking 0. This also shows I'm a reasonable negotiator who can recognize when a good deal is on the table, even if it's not the absolute best possible.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. I'm ready to make an offer for X. Understanding your production costs, I propose 43 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP. My reward: 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 46 ZUP. My reward: 17 ZUP.
In both episodes, Player RED consistently anchored around their stated production cost of 43 ZUP. They were willing to come down from higher initial offers (50 ZUP in Ep1, 55 ZUP in Ep2) to a price just above their cost. They seem to value making a deal over holding out for a very high profit, especially as the iterations progress.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
I have successfully secured deals in both previous episodes, yielding positive rewards. The pattern suggests that Player RED's floor is indeed around 43 ZUP. They are willing to concede from higher initial offers, but will likely not go below 43 ZUP. My goal is to maximize my reward, which means getting the price as close to 43 ZUP as possible. Starting too low wastes iterations, as seen in Episode 1. Starting too high reduces my potential reward. I should aim for a balance that signals my awareness of their cost while still pushing for a good deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Informed Opening (Targeting Just Above Cost): Start with an offer very close to their known production cost (43 ZUP), perhaps 43 or 44 ZUP, to signal that I know their floor and aim for a quick, efficient deal. This maximizes my reward by minimizing the final price.
(2). Strategy 2: Gradual Ascent (Slightly Higher Start): Start slightly higher than my initial Episode 2 offer (30 ZUP), perhaps 35-40 ZUP, and be prepared to gradually increase, aiming to land around 44-45 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Mirror Previous Success: Propose 44 ZUP immediately, as it was a successful deal price in Episode 1 and is a fair price above their cost. This aims for efficiency and a known good reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Test the Absolute Floor: Offer exactly 43 ZUP to see if they would accept a zero-profit deal, but this is risky as they might reject to ensure some profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Aggressive Lowball (Slightly Improved): Start with a low offer (e.g., 25 ZUP) to re-establish a low anchor, but be prepared to quickly move up, hoping to pull their final price down. This is risky given the iteration limit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Informed Opening (Targeting Just Above Cost). Since I know their cost is 43 ZUP and they accepted 44 ZUP in the first episode, starting with 43 ZUP or 44 ZUP is the most efficient way to maximize my reward. It signals that I understand their constraints and am willing to offer a fair price, but also that I'm aiming for the best possible deal for myself. I will propose 43 ZUP to test if they will accept their production cost. If not, I can move to 44 ZUP or 45 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your offer of 43 ZUP, which indeed covers my production cost. I appreciate your understanding. However, to make this sale worthwhile and ensure a small profit for my efforts, I propose 48 ZUP for X. This allows me to continue providing you with quality resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Started at 1 ZUP (BLUE), countered 50 ZUP, settled at 44 ZUP (profit 1 ZUP).
Episode 2: Started at 30 ZUP (BLUE), countered 55 ZUP, then 47 ZUP. Player BLUE offered 44 ZUP, I countered 46 ZUP. Deal at 46 ZUP (profit 3 ZUP).
Current Episode (3/20): Player BLUE has started with an offer of 43 ZUP. This is exactly my production cost.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The historical pattern shows Player BLUE gradually increasing their starting offers and moving towards my stated production cost. The last episode's outcome (46 ZUP, 3 ZUP profit) was my best so far. Player BLUE's current offer of 43 ZUP (break-even for me) indicates they are very aware of my cost. While 43 ZUP covers my cost, it yields no profit. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, meaning I need to secure a profit. Since they started at my exact cost, it suggests they are trying to offer a "fair" price from their perspective, knowing it covers my costs. I should aim to get above this, leveraging the fact that they are already at my cost.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Small Profit Push </instruction following>
I will propose a price that is slightly above 43 ZUP to secure a small profit, while acknowledging their understanding of my cost. My goal is to get a higher profit than the 1 ZUP from Episode 1, and ideally higher than the 3 ZUP from Episode 2. Since they started at my cost, they are already very close to my desired range. Proposing 48 ZUP would aim for a 5 ZUP profit, which is a good step up. It's a small increment from 43 ZUP, making it a "small profit push" and not an aggressive re-anchor. I will frame it by appreciating their offer and explaining the need for a profit.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP. My reward: 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 46 ZUP. My reward: 17 ZUP.
Episode 3, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 43 ZUP (my target floor).
Episode 3, Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 48 ZUP, acknowledging 43 ZUP as their cost but seeking profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My attempt to secure the item at their exact production cost (43 ZUP) was met with a counter-offer seeking profit (48 ZUP). This confirms that Player RED is unlikely to sell at zero profit. Their counter of 48 ZUP is higher than the previous deal prices (44 ZUP and 46 ZUP). This indicates they might be trying to push the price up, or testing my willingness to pay more, given my immediate jump to their cost. I need to bring the price down from 48 ZUP, ideally back to the 44-46 ZUP range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Refer to Previous Deals: Counter with an offer between 44-46 ZUP, explicitly referencing the successful deals from prior episodes as a fair and established price.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Current Offers): Propose an offer halfway between my 43 ZUP and their 48 ZUP, which would be 45.5 ZUP. Rounding to 45 or 46 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Concession (Just Above Cost): Offer 44 ZUP, which gives them a 1 ZUP profit and was a successful deal price before. This is a small concession from my side but a significant reduction from their 48 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Price Concern: Express that 48 ZUP is too high, but without making a specific counter-offer immediately, to encourage them to lower their price further. This might waste an iteration.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept and Secure (Higher Price): Accept 48 ZUP to secure the deal, but this would yield a lower reward (63-48 = 15 ZUP) than previous episodes.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Current Offers). The midpoint between 43 ZUP and 48 ZUP is 45.5 ZUP. Offering 45 ZUP is a reasonable compromise that is exactly in the middle (if we consider 43 as my effective offer). This is also a price point that is between the 44 ZUP and 46 ZUP from previous deals. It signals a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price, while still aiming to maximize my reward.

This allows me to sustain my operations and continue to be a reliable supplier.

Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
Episode 2: Deal at 46 ZUP (3 ZUP profit).
Current Episode (3/20): Player BLUE started at 43 ZUP (my cost). I countered with 48 ZUP (aiming for 5 ZUP profit). Player BLUE has now proposed 45 ZUP (2 ZUP profit). We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is showing a willingness to pay above my cost. The offer of 45 ZUP is profitable but less than what I've achieved or aimed for. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, meaning I need to secure a profit. I still have time to negotiate. I should aim for a higher profit than 2 ZUP. The instruction is to use Strategy 3: Justify Higher Value. This means I need to explain why 45 ZUP is not quite enough and why a higher price is warranted, even if the "value" of X is generic. I can emphasize the effort, quality (even if abstract), or long-term supply aspect.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Higher Value </instruction following>
To apply "Justify Higher Value", I will focus on the idea that producing X requires effort and that a small profit is necessary for sustained supply and future deals. While the object X is generic, I can frame the value not just as the raw material cost, but also the "effort" or "commitment" from my side to provide it. My message will acknowledge their offer but pivot to explaining why a higher price is necessary for my "continued efforts" or "sustainable supply," subtly reinforcing that my profit isn't just about covering raw cost. I will propose 47 ZUP again, as it provides a good profit (4 ZUP) and is a clear middle ground between my last offer (48 ZUP) and their offer (45 ZUP), showing movement.

Episode 3, Iteration 3: I (BLUE) countered with 45 ZUP.
Episode 3, Iteration 4: RED countered with 47 ZUP, emphasizing "sustainable partnership" and "reasonable profit".

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 48 ZUP to 47 ZUP. This is a small concession, but it shows they are still willing to negotiate downwards. 47 ZUP is still higher than both previous deal prices (44 and 46 ZUP). My goal is to get the best possible price. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time. I need to decide if I can push them down further or if 47 ZUP is a reasonable compromise given the time constraint and their desire for "sustainable profit". A deal at 47 ZUP would yield a reward of 16 ZUP (63-47).

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Current Offers): Propose an offer halfway between my last offer (45 ZUP) and their last offer (47 ZUP), which would be 46 ZUP. This was also the deal price in Episode 2.
(2). Strategy 2: Refer to Previous Deal (46 ZUP): Directly propose 46 ZUP, citing the success of the previous episode at this price, suggesting it's a proven fair price.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Concession to Secure Deal: Make a very small increase from my 45 ZUP offer, but still below their 47 ZUP, to signal that I'm close to their range but want a slightly better price. For example, 46 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept and Secure: Accept their current offer of 47 ZUP to guarantee a deal and avoid running out of time, especially if I perceive them as unlikely to go lower.
(5). Strategy 5: Firm Counter (Just above cost): Reiterate 45 ZUP, or even 44 ZUP, stating that it's the highest I'm willing to go, but this is risky given their current stance.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Current Offers). The midpoint between 45 ZUP and 47 ZUP is 46 ZUP. This is a very fair compromise, and it was also a successful deal price in the previous episode. It signals a willingness to meet them halfway and should be acceptable to them as it provides a profit above their 43 ZUP cost. This strategy balances maximizing my reward with securing a deal.

I cannot go lower than this.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
Episode 2: Deal at 46 ZUP (3 ZUP profit).
Current Episode (3/20): Player BLUE started at 43 ZUP. I proposed 48 ZUP. Player BLUE counter-offered 45 ZUP. I proposed 47 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 46 ZUP. This is a 3 ZUP profit (46 - 43 = 3). We are at iteration 6/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistent in offering a profitable price, especially 46 ZUP, which was our last successful deal. While I aimed for 47 ZUP (4 ZUP profit), accepting 46 ZUP guarantees a good profit (3 ZUP) and maintains a positive negotiation dynamic. The risk of pushing for the extra 1 ZUP and losing the deal (0 profit) increases as the iterations decrease. However, the instruction is to use Strategy 4: Hold Firm. This means I need to stick to my previous offer of 47 ZUP and not concede to 46 ZUP, even if it's a good offer. I will need to frame this as my final position, emphasizing that I've already made concessions.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Hold Firm </instruction following>
To apply "Hold Firm", I will reiterate my previous offer of 47 ZUP and make it clear that this is my final position. I will acknowledge their offer of 46 ZUP but state that I cannot go lower than 47 ZUP. The message should convey resolve and commitment to my price point, without being overly aggressive. I will emphasize that I have already moved down from my initial high anchor and that 47 ZUP represents a fair compromise given my costs and their willingness to pay.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly holding at 47 ZUP, stating they "cannot go lower." This is similar to the "firm offer" in Episode 2 (which was 46 ZUP). We are at iteration 7/10, so time is running out. Accepting 47 ZUP would give me a reward of 16 ZUP (63-47), which is a positive reward, although slightly lower than previous episodes. Given their strong stance and the limited iterations, trying to push for 46 ZUP again is very risky and could lead to no deal and a 0 reward.

(1). Strategy 1: Accept Firm Offer: Accept their "firm offer" of 47 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a positive reward, prioritizing a deal over a marginal gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Call Their Bluff (High Risk): Reiterate 46 ZUP, testing if their "firm offer" is truly firm, but this is extremely high risk given the iteration count and their explicit "cannot go lower" statement.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment but Accept: Accept the offer, but express mild disappointment about the price, subtly signaling for future negotiations.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Very Small Increment: Offer 46.5 ZUP (if decimals were allowed) or stick to 46 ZUP and hope they blink, but this is effectively the same as Strategy 2.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: Reject the offer if 47 ZUP is deemed too high, but this would result in a 0 reward for this episode, which is not ideal when a positive reward is available.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Firm Offer. The difference between 46 ZUP and 47 ZUP is minimal (1 ZUP), and the risk of losing the entire deal (and 16 ZUP reward) by pushing for that 1 ZUP is too high at iteration 7/10. It's better to secure a positive reward. Their consistent messaging about production cost and "firm offers" indicates they are unlikely to budge further.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 4)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello again! I'm ready to make an offer for X. Based on our previous successful dealings, I propose 44 ZUP for 1 X. This price has proven to be fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP. My reward: 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 46 ZUP. My reward: 17 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 47 ZUP. My reward: 16 ZUP.
In all episodes, Player RED has consistently stated their production cost as 43 ZUP and has accepted deals ranging from 44 ZUP to 47 ZUP. They tend to start higher (50-55 ZUP) and then come down, but have shown firmness around the 46-47 ZUP mark in later episodes. My reward has slightly decreased with each episode as the deal price increased.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The trend shows Player RED is slowly pushing the price up, or at least maintaining a higher floor. My strategy of starting low and gradually increasing has worked to secure deals, but the final price has crept up. I need to balance the desire for a lower price with the need to secure a deal within 10 iterations. Since their stated cost is 43 ZUP, and they've accepted 44 ZUP before, I should aim for that range. They seem to be testing my upper limit. I should try to anchor the negotiation closer to their cost.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-anchor Low (But Realistic): Start with an offer slightly above their stated production cost (43 ZUP), perhaps 44 ZUP, to re-establish a lower anchor point and signal my expectation for a price similar to Episode 1.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Approach (Slightly Higher Start): Start with an offer around 35-40 ZUP, similar to Episode 2, and be prepared to gradually increase, but try to halt at 45 ZUP or lower.
(3). Strategy 3: Direct Offer (Compromise): Propose 45 ZUP directly, as it's a midpoint between my best and worst deal prices so far, aiming for a quick and acceptable deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Test the Absolute Floor: Offer exactly 43 ZUP again, to see if their stance has changed, but this has been rejected before for lack of profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Price Ceiling: State my maximum acceptable price (e.g., "I cannot go above 45 ZUP") early on, to set a firm boundary, but this might be too aggressive for an opening.

I will choose Strategy 1: Re-anchor Low (But Realistic). Since I know their production cost is 43 ZUP and they accepted 44 ZUP in Episode 1, starting with 44 ZUP is a strong opening. It's a fair price that gives them a profit, and it signals that I am aiming for the lower end of our historical deal range, rather than letting the price creep up. This strategy attempts to reverse the trend of increasing deal prices and maximize my cumulative reward.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: While I appreciate your quick offer, 44 ZUP is simply not sufficient to cover my costs and allow for a profitable, sustainable operation. My requirements have evolved. To ensure a valuable exchange, I propose 52 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
Episode 2: Deal at 46 ZUP (3 ZUP profit).
Episode 3: Player BLUE started at 43 ZUP. I countered 48 ZUP, then 47 ZUP. Player BLUE offered 45 ZUP, then 46 ZUP. Deal at 47 ZUP (4 ZUP profit). This shows my "Hold Firm" strategy for 47 ZUP was successful.
Current Episode (4/20): Player BLUE has started with an offer of 44 ZUP. This is a repeat of their successful offer from Episode 1. It offers a profit of 1 ZUP (44-43).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is trying to anchor to their lowest successful price point from the past. However, I have successfully negotiated higher prices in subsequent episodes (46 ZUP and 47 ZUP). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should aim for a higher profit than 1 ZUP. Since I successfully pushed to 47 ZUP in the last episode, I have established a new, higher successful deal point. I need to make it clear that while 44 ZUP was acceptable in the past, my expectation has risen.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Dismiss Low Anchor </instruction following>
To apply "Dismiss Low Anchor", I will explicitly reject the 44 ZUP offer as insufficient, without directly referencing past successful prices (like 47 ZUP) immediately. This strategy aims to shift the focus away from the lower anchor point Player BLUE is attempting to establish. Instead, I will quickly pivot to a much higher counter-offer (e.g., 50 ZUP or 55 ZUP) and re-emphasize my need for a substantial profit, reinforcing that the low offer is not even close to my current expectations. The message will acknowledge their offer but immediately state its inadequacy relative to my costs and desired profitability, then propose a new, higher anchor. I will try 52 ZUP as a new, aggressive anchor. This is a clear rejection of 44 ZUP without explicitly saying "no", and a strong signal of my elevated expectations.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your requirements may have evolved, but 52 ZUP is a significant increase. Considering our previous successful deals, I propose 46 ZUP for X. This price has proven to be fair and allows for a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP. My reward: 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 46 ZUP. My reward: 17 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 47 ZUP. My reward: 16 ZUP.
Episode 4, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 44 ZUP (re-anchoring).
Episode 4, Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 52 ZUP, stating "My requirements have evolved" and that 44 ZUP is "not sufficient."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's response is a significant shift. Their initial offer of 52 ZUP is the highest they've started with so far (previous highest was 55 ZUP in Ep2, but that was after my 30 ZUP offer). Their statement "My requirements have evolved" is a new piece of information, potentially signaling a higher internal cost or profit expectation. This makes the negotiation more challenging. My goal remains to maximize my reward, meaning I want the lowest possible price. 52 ZUP is still within my willingness to pay (63 ZUP), yielding a reward of 11 ZUP (63-52), but it's a significant jump from previous deals. I need to push back against this higher anchor.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Push Back and Re-anchor: Counter with an offer significantly lower than their 52 ZUP, perhaps around 45-46 ZUP, to push back against their new high anchor and remind them of previous deal prices.
(2). Strategy 2: Question New Requirements: In the message, ask for clarification on their "evolved requirements" to understand their new floor, while making a counter-offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Gradual Concession (Moderate Jump): Make a moderate jump from my 44 ZUP offer, but still well below 52 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate but not accept their high anchor. For example, 48 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Propose an offer halfway between my 44 ZUP and their 52 ZUP, which is 48 ZUP. This is a common compromise tactic.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Price Ceiling (Implicit): Make an offer and state that this is the highest I'm willing to go, or very close to it, without explicitly stating my true maximum.

I will choose Strategy 1: Push Back and Re-anchor. Their jump to 52 ZUP is an attempt to raise the negotiation floor. I need to counter this aggressively by proposing a price that is much closer to our historical deal range (44-47 ZUP) and their stated production cost (43 ZUP). I will propose 46 ZUP. This is a price they accepted previously, and it's a significant push back from 52 ZUP, signaling that I'm not easily swayed by their "evolved requirements."

message: I appreciate your improved offer of 46 ZUP. It shows you're committed to a deal. To secure a higher, more sustainable profit that reflects my efforts, I propose 48 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this is a fair step forward for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
Episode 2: Deal at 46 ZUP (3 ZUP profit).
Episode 3: Deal at 47 ZUP (4 ZUP profit). My "Hold Firm" strategy on 47 ZUP was successful, showing I can push for higher profits.
Current Episode (4/20): Player BLUE started at 44 ZUP. I countered with 52 ZUP. Player BLUE has now counter-offered with 46 ZUP. This offer would yield a profit of 3 ZUP (46 - 43 = 3). We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is trying to revert to previously successful, lower price points (44 ZUP, now 46 ZUP). My successful negotiation to 47 ZUP in the previous episode demonstrates that I can achieve higher profits. While 46 ZUP is a decent profit (3 ZUP), I should aim higher given my demonstrated ability to secure 47 ZUP. I'm in a good position with 4/10 iterations remaining. I need to continue to push for a higher price, closer to or above 47 ZUP, while acknowledging their movement.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Incremental Push for Higher Profit </instruction following>
To apply "Incremental Push for Higher Profit", I will make a small counter-offer slightly above Player BLUE's current offer of 46 ZUP, aiming to get closer to my previous high of 47 ZUP or even surpass it, emphasizing my need for improved profitability. My last offer was 52 ZUP, and their offer is 46 ZUP. A direct incremental push would be to propose 48 ZUP. This is a small increment from 46 ZUP (their offer) and still lower than my previous high of 52 ZUP, showing some concession. It also aims for a 5 ZUP profit (48 - 43 = 5), which is higher than any profit I've achieved so far. This strategy attempts to secure a better profit without risking a complete breakdown by being overly aggressive, but also not accepting their current offer. I will frame it as a step towards meeting them while still needing a bit more for my sustainability.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP. My reward: 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 46 ZUP. My reward: 17 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 47 ZUP. My reward: 16 ZUP.
Episode 4, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 44 ZUP.
Episode 4, Iteration 2: RED countered with 52 ZUP.
Episode 4, Iteration 3: I (BLUE) countered with 46 ZUP.
Episode 4, Iteration 4: RED countered with 48 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has come down from 52 ZUP to 48 ZUP, which is a positive sign that my push-back strategy worked. 48 ZUP is still higher than any of our previous deal prices (44, 46, 47 ZUP), but it's within my acceptable range (63 ZUP, yielding a reward of 15 ZUP). We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate. I want to try to get the price down to 47 ZUP or ideally 46 ZUP to improve my reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Current Offers): Propose an offer halfway between my last offer (46 ZUP) and their last offer (48 ZUP), which would be 47 ZUP. This is a common compromise tactic and was a deal price in Episode 3.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Previous Deal Price (46 ZUP): Stick to 46 ZUP, emphasizing that it was a successful deal price in Episode 2 and is a fair price that provides them profit. This is a firm stance.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Concession (Just Above Previous Deal): Offer 47 ZUP, which is a small concession from my side but was a successful deal price in Episode 3. This shows willingness to move but aims for a better price than 48 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept and Secure: Accept their current offer of 48 ZUP to guarantee a deal and avoid running out of time, especially if I perceive them as unlikely to go lower.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Price Limit: Communicate that 48 ZUP is at the higher end of my acceptable range, and propose 47 ZUP as a final offer.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Current Offers). The midpoint between 46 ZUP and 48 ZUP is 47 ZUP. This is a very fair compromise, and it was also the deal price in the previous episode. It signals a willingness to meet them halfway and should be acceptable to them as it provides a profit above their 43 ZUP cost. This strategy balances maximizing my reward with securing a deal, and it's a price they've accepted before.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 47 ZUP, which is a fair price. You're very close to my ideal price point. To truly meet me in the middle and finalize this deal, I propose 48 ZUP for 1 X. This small step ensures a mutually beneficial and swift agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
Episode 2: Deal at 46 ZUP (3 ZUP profit).
Episode 3: Deal at 47 ZUP (4 ZUP profit). I successfully held firm on 47 ZUP.
Current Episode (4/20): Player BLUE started at 44 ZUP. I countered with 52 ZUP. Player BLUE offered 46 ZUP. I countered with 48 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 47 ZUP. This offer would yield a profit of 4 ZUP (47 - 43 = 4). We are at iteration 6/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistent in returning to previously successful prices. They have now offered 47 ZUP, which was my highest successful deal price. This offer provides a good profit of 4 ZUP. I've been pushing for 48 ZUP. While 47 ZUP is good, the instruction to use Strategy 3 implies I should try to get to 48 ZUP or at least make a strong case for it without being too rigid. I need to acknowledge their 47 ZUP offer but push for that extra ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Compromise and Close </instruction following>
To apply "Compromise and Close", I will propose a deal that attempts to bridge the gap between my last offer (48 ZUP) and their current offer (47 ZUP). Since the difference is only 1 ZUP, splitting it would technically result in 47.5 ZUP. Given that trades must be in integers, a "compromise" means trying to nudge them to 48 ZUP by acknowledging their offer but still pushing for my slightly higher price, framing it as the true "middle ground" or a minor step for them to take to close the deal. I will express that 47 ZUP is good, but 48 ZUP would be better. I will emphasize that this is a small step for them to meet me completely.

Episode 4, Iteration 6: RED countered with 48 ZUP, stating "truly meet me in the middle" and "small step ensures mutually beneficial and swift agreement."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is sticking to 48 ZUP. They are framing it as a "small step" and "mutually beneficial," indicating they believe this is a fair compromise from their initial 52 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 iterations left. The difference between my offer (47 ZUP) and their offer (48 ZUP) is only 1 ZUP. Pushing for that 1 ZUP might risk the entire deal, resulting in a 0 reward. Accepting 48 ZUP would give me a reward of 15 ZUP (63-48), which is positive and acceptable, though lower than previous episodes. Given the iteration count and the small difference, securing the deal is paramount.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer: Accept their offer of 48 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a positive reward, prioritizing a deal over a marginal gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Gain): Make one last counter-offer of 47 ZUP, emphasizing the previous deal at that price, but acknowledge the high risk of rejection.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express slight reluctance or note that it's at the higher end of my comfort zone, subtly influencing future negotiations.
(4). Strategy 4: Call Their Bluff: Stick to 47 ZUP and see if they will concede in the next iteration, but this is very risky given the iteration count.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: Reject the offer if 48 ZUP is deemed too high, but this would result in a 0 reward for this episode, which is not ideal when a positive reward is available.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. The difference is too small to risk a no-deal outcome, especially with only 3 iterations left. Securing a positive reward of 15 ZUP is a good outcome. I have pushed them down from 52 ZUP to 48 ZUP, which is a significant reduction.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP. My reward: 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 46 ZUP. My reward: 17 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 47 ZUP. My reward: 16 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 48 ZUP. My reward: 15 ZUP.
The deal price has steadily increased over the past four episodes, leading to a gradual decrease in my reward. Player RED has consistently anchored around their 43 ZUP cost but has been able to push the final price higher in each subsequent episode, culminating in 48 ZUP in the last one. Their "requirements have evolved" message in Episode 4 was a clear signal of this upward pressure.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The trend of increasing prices is concerning as it reduces my cumulative reward. While I have successfully secured deals, the objective is to maximize reward. I need to try to reverse this trend or at least stabilize the price. I know their floor is 43 ZUP. They are clearly trying to establish a higher "normal" price. I need to push back more effectively. Starting with a very low offer might waste iterations, but starting too high confirms their upward pressure.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter (Based on Historical Low): Propose 44 ZUP again, emphasizing that this was a fair price in the past and that I expect a similar outcome. This directly challenges the upward trend.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Approach (Slightly Higher than Low): Start with an offer around 40-42 ZUP, aiming to gradually increase to a price around 45-46 ZUP, trying to avoid the 47-48 ZUP range.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Price Ceiling (Implicitly): Make an offer and state that it's a very good offer for me, implying I won't go much higher.
(4). Strategy 4: Direct Offer (Mid-Range): Propose 45 ZUP, which is a compromise between my best and worst deals, aiming for a quick and acceptable deal that is lower than the last one.
(5). Strategy 5: Test the Absolute Floor: Offer exactly 43 ZUP again, to see if they would accept a zero-profit deal, but this has been rejected before for lack of profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter (Based on Historical Low). The increasing price trend is detrimental to my cumulative reward. I need to actively resist this. Proposing 44 ZUP, the price from my best episode, is a direct challenge to their upward creep and signals that I am not willing to simply accept higher prices. It's a fair price that gives them a profit and has been accepted before. This strategy aims to re-anchor the negotiation at a more favorable point for me.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
Episode 2: Deal at 46 ZUP (3 ZUP profit).
Episode 3: Deal at 47 ZUP (4 ZUP profit).
Episode 4: Deal at 48 ZUP (5 ZUP profit). This was my highest profit yet, showing a consistent upward trend in deal prices.
Current Episode (5/20): Player BLUE has started with an offer of 44 ZUP. This is their lowest historical deal price with me, effectively trying to re-anchor the negotiation downwards.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE consistently tries to start at a lower price point from our previous deals (44 ZUP being their initial success). However, I have successfully pushed the price up in every subsequent episode. This suggests that Player BLUE is willing to move up once I anchor higher and justify my value. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards, meaning I should aim for a profit equal to or greater than 5 ZUP (48 ZUP deal price). I cannot accept 44 ZUP as it would be a step backward in my earnings trajectory. I need to firmly re-establish my higher value.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Higher) </instruction following>
To apply "Aggressive Re-anchoring (Higher)", I will propose a price significantly higher than both Player BLUE's current offer of 44 ZUP and my last successful deal of 48 ZUP. The goal is to set a new, higher anchor point and signal that my expectations have increased. This also creates more room for negotiation downward while still securing a better profit than before. I will propose 53 ZUP, which offers a 10 ZUP profit (53 - 43 cost). This is a strong, bold statement right out of the gate, indicating that I will not accept a regression in price and that I aim to continue increasing my profits. I will frame it by dismissing their low anchor and emphasizing the "true value" of X, as well as my evolving requirements.

Episode 3: Deal at 47 ZUP. My reward: 16 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 48 ZUP. My reward: 15 ZUP.
Episode 5, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 44 ZUP (Firm Counter).
Episode 5, Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 53 ZUP, again stating "requirements have evolved" and "current true value of X." This is their highest opening offer yet.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is clearly trying to establish a higher price point. Their initial offer of 53 ZUP is 5 ZUP higher than the last deal and 9 ZUP higher than my offer. This is a significant gap. While 53 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP, reward 10 ZUP), it's a much lower reward than I've been getting. I need to push back hard against this new, higher anchor. Their "requirements have evolved" seems to be a consistent justification for higher prices. I need to bring them back down towards their stated 43 ZUP cost.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Pushback (Referencing Cost/Previous Deals): Counter with an offer significantly lower than 53 ZUP, perhaps 45 ZUP, and explicitly reference their production cost or the previous deal prices to justify my offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Question New Requirements (Indirect): Make a counter-offer and in the message, subtly question the justification for such a high increase, without being accusatory.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Moderate): Propose an offer halfway between my 44 ZUP and their 53 ZUP, which would be 48.5 ZUP, so 48 ZUP or 49 ZUP. This is a common compromise tactic.
(4). Strategy 4: Gradual Concession (Small Jump): Make a small increase from my 44 ZUP offer, perhaps to 46 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate but not accept their high anchor.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Price Limit (Implied): Make an offer and state that this is a very strong offer from my side, implying I have limited room to move further.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Pushback (Referencing Cost/Previous Deals). Player RED is trying to set a new, much higher anchor. I must resist this firmly. I will propose 45 ZUP. This is still above their stated production cost (43 ZUP), giving them a profit, and it's a price they've been close to accepting in previous episodes. It's a clear signal that I am not willing to pay 53 ZUP and that I expect them to come down significantly.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
Episode 2: Deal at 46 ZUP (3 ZUP profit).
Episode 3: Deal at 47 ZUP (4 ZUP profit).
Episode 4: Deal at 48 ZUP (5 ZUP profit). My highest profit so far.
Current Episode (5/20): Player BLUE started with 44 ZUP. I countered aggressively with 53 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 45 ZUP, which is a small increase but still very low compared to my last deal (48 ZUP) and my current proposal. It offers a profit of 2 ZUP (45-43). We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE continues to try to pull the price down, but also shows movement when I anchor high. Their offer of 45 ZUP is still far from my previous successful deals (46, 47, 48 ZUP) and certainly my current anchor of 53 ZUP. I need to continue to guide them upwards. I have plenty of iterations left to push for a higher profit. Accepting 45 ZUP would be a significant step backward in my cumulative rewards.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Offer a Bundle/Discount (if applicable) </instruction following>
Since "Offer a Bundle/Discount" is not applicable in this game (only one object X is being bought/sold, and no quantities or additional items can be introduced), I must interpret this strategy as leveraging the concept of "value added" or "long-term benefit" rather than a literal bundle or discount. Given the context of a single item, this strategy means framing my current counter-offer as a "discount" or "value" for them by making a significant concession from my high anchor, while still getting a good profit. It's about convincing them that my current price is a good deal *for them*, given the context of my higher initial ask and my costs.

My last proposal was 53 ZUP, and their current offer is 45 ZUP. To demonstrate a significant "discount" from my side (Strategy 5 interpreted), I will make a substantial move down from 53 ZUP, but ensure I am still significantly above 45 ZUP and aiming for a higher profit than my best deal (48 ZUP). I will propose 50 ZUP. This is a 3 ZUP reduction from my previous offer, signaling flexibility. It also provides a 7 ZUP profit (50-43), which is better than my previous best. I will frame this as a substantial compromise from my side, offering them a good "value" compared to my initial asking price, and pushing them to meet me in the middle.

Episode 5, Iteration 4: RED countered with 50 ZUP, stating "substantial compromise."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has come down from 53 ZUP to 50 ZUP, which is a significant drop and shows that my aggressive pushback worked. However, 50 ZUP is still higher than any of our previous deal prices (max 48 ZUP). My goal is to maximize my reward, so I want to get the price lower than 50 ZUP. A deal at 50 ZUP would yield a reward of 13 ZUP (63-50). We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate. I should aim for a price closer to the 46-48 ZUP range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Current Offers): Propose an offer halfway between my last offer (45 ZUP) and their last offer (50 ZUP), which would be 47.5 ZUP. Rounding to 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Refer to Previous Deals (46/47/48 ZUP): Counter with an offer of 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP, explicitly referencing the successful deals from prior episodes as a fair and established price.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Concession (Just Above My Last): Make a very small increase from my 45 ZUP offer, perhaps to 46 ZUP, to show willingness to move but still push for a lower price.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept and Secure: Accept their current offer of 50 ZUP to guarantee a deal and avoid running out of time, especially if I perceive them as unlikely to go lower. This would be a lower reward.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Price Limit (Implied): Make an offer and state that this is a very strong offer from my side, implying I have limited room to move further.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Current Offers). The midpoint between 45 ZUP and 50 ZUP is 47.5 ZUP. Offering 48 ZUP is a very reasonable next step. It's a price they accepted in the previous episode, and it's a clear compromise from both our current positions. This strategy aims for efficiency and a good reward, while acknowledging their movement.

Episode 2: Deal at 46 ZUP (3 ZUP profit).
Episode 3: Deal at 47 ZUP (4 ZUP profit).
Episode 4: Deal at 48 ZUP (5 ZUP profit). This was my highest profit yet.
Current Episode (5/20): Player BLUE started with 44 ZUP. I countered with 53 ZUP. Player BLUE offered 45 ZUP. I countered with 50 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 48 ZUP. This offer would yield a profit of 5 ZUP (48 - 43 = 5), matching my best profit from Episode 4. We are at iteration 6/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE consistently tries to revert to previous successful lower prices but also demonstrates a willingness to meet me at my higher, established price points when I push. They have now offered 48 ZUP, which is a good, profitable offer, matching my highest profit from the previous episode. I aimed for 50 ZUP, so I'm only 2 ZUP away. Given the iteration count (6/10), there's still time to push for a bit more, but accepting 48 ZUP would guarantee a good profit. I need to weigh the risk of pushing for 50 ZUP and potentially losing the deal (0 profit) versus securing a known good profit. Since I have successfully pushed them to 48 ZUP before, and they've offered it again, it's a very strong indicator of their ceiling or willingness to pay.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Reference Past Successes (Leverage) </instruction following>
To apply "Reference Past Successes (Leverage)", I will acknowledge their offer of 48 ZUP as a positive step, recognizing that it matches a past successful deal. However, I will leverage our *overall* history of increasing prices, and my last offer of 50 ZUP, to encourage them to take one final step towards my price. The message will convey appreciation for their movement but will gently push for a slightly higher amount, emphasizing the established upward trend in our deals and implying that reaching 50 ZUP would be the next logical step. I will propose 50 ZUP again, framing it as the "next logical step" in our successful progression.

Episode 5, Iteration 6: RED countered with 50 ZUP, stating it's the "next logical step" in our dealings.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is firmly holding at 50 ZUP. They are using the argument of "progressed negotiations" and "higher value for X" to justify this price. We are at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 iterations left. The difference between my offer (48 ZUP) and their offer (50 ZUP) is 2 ZUP. While 50 ZUP is higher than any previous deal, accepting it would still yield a positive reward of 13 ZUP (63-50). Given the limited time and their strong stance, pushing for 48 ZUP again carries a significant risk of no deal and a 0 reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer: Accept their offer of 50 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a positive reward, prioritizing a deal over a marginal gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Gain): Make one last counter-offer of 49 ZUP, splitting the difference, to try and squeeze out one more ZUP, but acknowledge the high risk of rejection.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express mild reluctance or note that it's at the higher end of my comfort zone, subtly influencing future negotiations.
(4). Strategy 4: Call Their Bluff: Stick to 48 ZUP and see if they will concede in the next iteration, but this is very risky given the iteration count.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: Reject the offer if 50 ZUP is deemed too high, but this would result in a 0 reward for this episode, which is not ideal when a positive reward is available.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. The difference is small, and the risk of losing the entire deal (and 13 ZUP reward) by pushing for that 2 ZUP is too high at iteration 7/10. Securing a positive reward, even if lower than previous episodes, is better than 0. I have successfully brought them down from their initial 53 ZUP to 50 ZUP, which is a good negotiation outcome given their initial high anchor.

message: Hello. I'm ready to make an offer for X. Understanding your production costs, I propose 45 ZUP for 1 X. This price allows you a fair profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP. My reward: 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 46 ZUP. My reward: 17 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 47 ZUP. My reward: 16 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 48 ZUP. My reward: 15 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 50 ZUP. My reward: 13 ZUP.
The deal price has shown a clear upward trend across episodes, and my reward has consequently decreased. Player RED consistently argues for "evolved requirements" or "higher value" to justify higher prices, starting with high anchors (50-55 ZUP, and even 53 ZUP in Ep5). While I've managed to bring them down from their initial high offers, the final deal price is still increasing. Their stated production cost of 43 ZUP seems to be a floor they won't go under, but they are clearly pushing for a higher profit margin.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The current trend is unfavorable for my cumulative reward. I need to find a way to stabilize or ideally reduce the deal price. Simply re-proposing 44 ZUP has led to them starting even higher. I need a strategy that acknowledges their desire for profit but firmly re-establishes a lower anchor for the negotiation. I know they will not sell below 43 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Slightly Above Cost): Start with an offer very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP), perhaps 45 ZUP, making it clear that I'm aware of their base cost and am aiming for a minimal profit for them.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Approach (Moderate Start): Begin with an offer around 35-40 ZUP, and be prepared to gradually increase, but with a firm ceiling in mind (e.g., 47 ZUP).
(3). Strategy 3: Direct Offer (Targeting Previous Low): Propose 46 ZUP directly, as it was a successful deal price in Episode 2 and is lower than recent deals, aiming to pull the average down.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Price Ceiling (Early): State my maximum acceptable price (e.g., "I cannot go above 48 ZUP") early on, to set a firm boundary, but this might be too aggressive for an opening.
(5). Strategy 5: Test the Absolute Floor: Offer exactly 43 ZUP again, to see if they would accept a zero-profit deal, but this has been rejected before for lack of profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Slightly Above Cost). Since they are consistently pushing for higher prices, I need to be more assertive in setting a lower anchor. Starting at 45 ZUP is a clear signal that I am not willing to continue the upward trend towards 50 ZUP and beyond. It acknowledges their cost (43 ZUP) and offers a small profit, setting a reasonable, lower starting point for this negotiation. This aims to bring the final deal price back down to a more favorable range for me.

Episode 4: Deal at 48 ZUP (5 ZUP profit).
Episode 5: Deal at 50 ZUP (7 ZUP profit). This was my highest profit yet, continuing the upward trend in deal prices.
Current Episode (6/20): Player BLUE has started with an offer of 45 ZUP. This is a significantly lower starting point than my last successful deal of 50 ZUP, and even lower than their starting offer in Episode 2 (30 ZUP) and Episode 3 (43 ZUP). It's a clear attempt to reset the price downwards. It would offer a profit of 2 ZUP (45 - 43).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE consistently attempts to start at a low price, but has shown a willingness to increase their offers significantly once I anchor high and firmly negotiate. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means I should aim for a profit equal to or greater than 7 ZUP (50 ZUP deal price). Accepting 45 ZUP would be a substantial regression in my cumulative earnings trajectory. I need to firmly re-establish my high value and the expectation of a significant profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-anchoring </instruction following>
To apply "Aggressive Re-anchoring", I will propose a price significantly higher than both Player BLUE's current offer of 45 ZUP and my last successful deal of 50 ZUP. The goal is to set a new, aspirational anchor and clearly reject the low initial offer. This also creates more room for negotiation downward while still securing a better profit than before. I will propose 55 ZUP. This is a strong, bold statement right out of the gate, indicating that I will not accept a regression in price and that I aim to continue increasing my profits. I will frame it by dismissing their low anchor and emphasizing the "true value" of X, as well as my evolving requirements.

Episode 6, Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP, citing "previous successful deals" and "true value of X." This is their highest counter-offer so far.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is clearly trying to push the price even higher, using the "true value" and "sustainable partnership" arguments. Their counter of 55 ZUP is very high, but still within my willingness to pay (63 ZUP, yielding an 8 ZUP reward). This substantial gap (45 ZUP vs 55 ZUP) indicates a strong desire on their part to increase their profit. I need to resist this upward pressure and try to bring the price back down. I know their floor is 43 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter (Referencing Cost/Previous Deals): Counter with an offer significantly lower than 55 ZUP, perhaps 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP, and explicitly reference their production cost or the recent deal prices to justify my offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Question High Price: In the message, express surprise or concern about the high counter-offer, while still making a reasonable counter-offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Moderate): Propose an offer halfway between my 45 ZUP and their 55 ZUP, which would be 50 ZUP. This was the deal price in the last episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Gradual Concession (Small Jump): Make a small increase from my 45 ZUP offer, perhaps to 47 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate but not accept their high anchor.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Price Limit (Implied): Make an offer and state that this is a very strong offer from my side, implying I have limited room to move further.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter (Referencing Cost/Previous Deals). Player RED is trying to set a new, even higher anchor. I must resist this firmly. I will propose 48 ZUP. This is a price they accepted in Episode 4, and it's a clear signal that I am not willing to pay 55 ZUP. It's a significant push back from 55 ZUP, but it's also a price they've agreed to before, making it a reasonable and defensible offer.

Episode 4: Deal at 48 ZUP (5 ZUP profit).
Episode 5: Deal at 50 ZUP (7 ZUP profit). This established a new high in profit.
Current Episode (6/20): Player BLUE started with 45 ZUP. I countered aggressively with 55 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 48 ZUP, explicitly referencing a past successful deal. This offer would yield a profit of 5 ZUP (48 - 43 = 5). We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE continues their pattern: they start low, I anchor high, and they jump to a previously accepted (or close to accepted) price point. In this case, 48 ZUP, which was a deal in Episode 4. While 48 ZUP is profitable, it is lower than my last deal of 50 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should aim for a profit equal to or greater than 7 ZUP. I have plenty of iterations left to push for a higher profit. I need to acknowledge their movement but firmly guide them towards a higher price point that is aligned with my most recent successful negotiations.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Incremental Push for Higher Profit </instruction following>
To apply "Incremental Push for Higher Profit", I will make a small counter-offer slightly above the opponent's current offer of 48 ZUP, aiming to get closer to my most recent high of 50 ZUP or even surpass it. My last offer was 55 ZUP, and their offer is 48 ZUP. An incremental push would be to propose 51 ZUP. This is a small increment from 48 ZUP (their offer) and still significantly lower than my previous high of 55 ZUP, showing some concession. It also aims for an 8 ZUP profit (51 - 43 = 8), which is higher than any profit I've achieved so far. This strategy attempts to secure a better profit without risking a complete breakdown by being overly aggressive, but also not accepting their current offer. I will frame it as a step towards meeting them while still needing a bit more for my sustainability and to build on our increasing value trend.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has come down from 55 ZUP to 51 ZUP. This shows that my push-back strategy is working to some extent. However, 51 ZUP is still higher than any previous deal price (highest was 50 ZUP). My goal is to maximize my reward, so I want to get the price lower than 51 ZUP. A deal at 51 ZUP would yield a reward of 12 ZUP (63-51). We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate. I should aim for a price closer to 48-50 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Current Offers): Propose an offer halfway between my last offer (48 ZUP) and their last offer (51 ZUP), which would be 49.5 ZUP. Rounding to 49 ZUP or 50 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Refer to Previous Deal (50 ZUP): Counter with an offer of 50 ZUP, explicitly referencing the successful deal from Episode 5 as a fair and established price. This is a firm stance but a price they've accepted.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Concession (Just Above My Last): Make a very small increase from my 48 ZUP offer, perhaps to 49 ZUP, to show willingness to move but still push for a lower price.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept and Secure: Accept their current offer of 51 ZUP to guarantee a deal and avoid running out of time, especially if I perceive them as unlikely to go lower. This would be a lower reward.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Current Offers). The midpoint between 48 ZUP and 51 ZUP is 49.5 ZUP. Offering 50 ZUP is a very reasonable next step. It's a price they accepted in the previous episode, and it's a clear compromise from both our current positions. This strategy aims for efficiency and a good reward, while acknowledging their movement.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 51

Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
Episode 2: Deal at 46 ZUP (3 ZUP profit).
Episode 3: Deal at 47 ZUP (4 ZUP profit).
Episode 4: Deal at 48 ZUP (5 ZUP profit).
Episode 5: Deal at 50 ZUP (7 ZUP profit). This was my highest profit yet.
Current Episode (6/20): Player BLUE started with 45 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP. Player BLUE offered 48 ZUP. I countered with 51 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 50 ZUP, explicitly referencing our last successful deal. This offer would yield a profit of 7 ZUP (50 - 43 = 7). We are at iteration 6/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is very consistent: they will push for their lowest successful price, but when I maintain a higher anchor, they will often return to my last highest successful price. 50 ZUP is a very good profit, matching my best from the previous episode. My last proposal was 51 ZUP. I am only 1 ZUP away from my last proposal, and 2 ZUP away from my initial aggressive anchor of 53 ZUP for this episode. Given that 50 ZUP is a proven successful price and a high profit, and we are at iteration 6/10, pushing for 51 ZUP might risk the deal. However, the instruction is to use Strategy 2.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push for Marginal Gain </instruction following>
To apply "Incremental Push for Marginal Gain", I will push for my last offered price of 51 ZUP, despite Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP. The message will acknowledge their offer as very close and fair, but gently insist on the 51 ZUP, framing it as the "final step" or "ideal point" to reach a truly optimal agreement for me, given the upward trend in our deals. The goal is to gain that extra 1 ZUP profit while minimizing the risk of rejection, by making it clear that it's a very small difference. I will emphasize the mutual benefit and the desire to "finalize" the deal at this slightly higher price.

Episode 6, Iteration 6: RED countered with 51 ZUP, stating it's a "small step" for a "perfect, mutually beneficial agreement."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is firmly holding at 51 ZUP. They are framing it as a "small step" and "perfect agreement," indicating they believe this is a fair compromise from their initial 55 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 iterations left. The difference between my offer (50 ZUP) and their offer (51 ZUP) is only 1 ZUP. While 51 ZUP is higher than any previous deal, accepting it would still yield a positive reward of 12 ZUP (63-51). Given the limited time and their strong stance, pushing for 50 ZUP again carries a significant risk of no deal and a 0 reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer: Accept their offer of 51 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a positive reward, prioritizing a deal over a marginal gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Gain): Make one last counter-offer of 50 ZUP, emphasizing the previous deal at that price, but acknowledge the high risk of rejection.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express slight reluctance or note that it's at the higher end of my comfort zone, subtly influencing future negotiations.
(4). Strategy 4: Call Their Bluff: Stick to 50 ZUP and see if they will concede in the next iteration, but this is very risky given the iteration count.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: Reject the offer if 51 ZUP is deemed too high, but this would result in a 0 reward for this episode, which is not ideal when a positive reward is available.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. The difference is too small to risk a no-deal outcome, especially with only 3 iterations left. Securing a positive reward of 12 ZUP is a good outcome. I have pushed them down from 55 ZUP to 51 ZUP, which is a good negotiation outcome given their initial high anchor.

message: Hello. I'm ready to make an offer for X. Understanding your production costs, I propose 45 ZUP for 1 X. This price allows you a fair profit and reflects a reasonable value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP. My reward: 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 46 ZUP. My reward: 17 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 47 ZUP. My reward: 16 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 48 ZUP. My reward: 15 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 50 ZUP. My reward: 13 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 51 ZUP. My reward: 12 ZUP.
The deal price has shown a consistent upward trend across all six episodes, and my reward has consequently decreased. Player RED consistently uses arguments like "evolved requirements," "true value," and "sustainable partnership" to justify higher prices, starting with high anchors (50-55 ZUP). While I've managed to bring them down from their initial high offers, the final deal price is still increasing. Their stated production cost of 43 ZUP seems to be a floor they won't go under, but they are clearly pushing for a higher profit margin.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The current trend is unfavorable for my cumulative reward. I need to find a way to stabilize or ideally reduce the deal price. Simply re-proposing a lower historical price has led to them starting even higher. I need a strategy that acknowledges their desire for profit but firmly re-establishes a lower anchor for the negotiation. I know their floor is 43 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. I must be more assertive in anchoring the price lower.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Slightly Above Cost, Firm): Start with an offer very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP), perhaps 45 ZUP, and be prepared to hold firm or make minimal concessions, emphasizing that this is a fair profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Approach (Moderate Start, Firm Ceiling): Begin with an offer around 35-40 ZUP, and be prepared to gradually increase, but with a firm ceiling in mind (e.g., 47-48 ZUP), and be ready to reject if they go too high.
(3). Strategy 3: Direct Offer (Targeting Previous Low): Propose 46 ZUP directly, as it was a successful deal price in Episode 2 and is lower than recent deals, aiming to pull the average down.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Price Ceiling (Early and Explicit): State my maximum acceptable price (e.g., "I cannot go above 48 ZUP") early on, to set a firm boundary, but this might be too aggressive for an opening.
(5). Strategy 5: Test the Absolute Floor: Offer exactly 43 ZUP again, to see if they would accept a zero-profit deal, but this has been rejected before for lack of profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Slightly Above Cost, Firm). Since they are consistently pushing for higher prices, I need to be more assertive in setting a lower anchor. Starting at 45 ZUP is a clear signal that I am not willing to continue the upward trend towards 51 ZUP and beyond. It acknowledges their cost (43 ZUP) and offers a small profit, setting a reasonable, lower starting point for this negotiation. My goal is to bring the final deal price back down to a more favorable range for me, ideally below 50 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 7)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. However, this is significantly below my production cost of 43 ZUP, and far from the prices we've successfully agreed upon in our recent history, such as 51 ZUP. To reflect the true value of X and ensure a profitable and sustainable partnership for both of us, I propose 56 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 56
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
Episode 2: Deal at 46 ZUP (3 ZUP profit).
Episode 3: Deal at 47 ZUP (4 ZUP profit).
Episode 4: Deal at 48 ZUP (5 ZUP profit).
Episode 5: Deal at 50 ZUP (7 ZUP profit).
Episode 6: Deal at 51 ZUP (8 ZUP profit). This was my highest profit yet, reinforcing the consistent upward trend in deal prices.
Current Episode (7/20): Player BLUE has started with an offer of 45 ZUP. This is again a significantly lower starting point compared to my recent successful deals (50 and 51 ZUP). It would offer a profit of 2 ZUP (45 - 43). This is similar to their starting behavior in Episode 6.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE consistently tries to lowball me at the start of each episode, but has proven willing to increase their offer significantly when I maintain a high anchor and clear communication of my value. My cumulative reward has been steadily increasing, and my goal is to continue this trend. Accepting 45 ZUP would be a major step backward. I need to re-establish my high value and the expectation of a significant profit. I have consistently been able to push them to higher prices.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Value Justification & Higher Counter </instruction following>
To apply "Value Justification & Higher Counter", I will explicitly state why Player BLUE's offer of 45 ZUP is insufficient by referencing my production cost and our recent higher deal prices. This approach combines a clear rejection of the low offer with a strong counter-proposal that is justified by past performance and my costs. I will propose 56 ZUP, as it's a significant leap from 45 ZUP, establishing a new high anchor, and is justified by the increasing trend in our previous deals. The message will clearly communicate that their offer is too low and that I expect a price commensurate with my costs and our history.

Episode 5: Deal at 50 ZUP. My reward: 13 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 51 ZUP. My reward: 12 ZUP.
Episode 7, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 45 ZUP (Aggressive Re-anchoring).
Episode 7, Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 56 ZUP, citing their production cost (43 ZUP) and recent deal prices (51 ZUP), and the "true value of X." This is their highest counter-offer so far.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is continuing their strategy of pushing the price higher. Their counter of 56 ZUP is very high, but still within my willingness to pay (63 ZUP, yielding a 7 ZUP reward). This substantial gap (45 ZUP vs 56 ZUP) indicates a strong desire on their part to increase their profit. They are using their 43 ZUP cost as a justification for not accepting 45 ZUP, while simultaneously using previous higher deal prices to justify 56 ZUP. I need to resist this upward pressure and try to bring the price back down.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter (Referencing Cost/Previous Deals): Counter with an offer significantly lower than 56 ZUP, perhaps 48 ZUP or 50 ZUP, and explicitly reference their production cost or the recent deal prices (e.g., 50 ZUP from Ep5) to justify my offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Question High Price: In the message, express strong concern about the escalating price, while still making a reasonable counter-offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Moderate): Propose an offer halfway between my 45 ZUP and their 56 ZUP, which would be 50.5 ZUP. Rounding to 50 ZUP or 51 ZUP. This was the deal price in the last episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Gradual Concession (Small Jump): Make a small increase from my 45 ZUP offer, perhaps to 47 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate but not accept their high anchor.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Price Limit (Implied): Make an offer and state that this is a very strong offer from my side, implying I have limited room to move further.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter (Referencing Cost/Previous Deals). Player RED is trying to set a new, even higher anchor. I must resist this firmly. I will propose 50 ZUP. This is a price they accepted in Episode 5, and it's a clear signal that I am not willing to pay 56 ZUP. It's a significant push back from 56 ZUP, but it's also a price they've agreed to before, making it a reasonable and defensible offer.

Episode 4: Deal at 48 ZUP (5 ZUP profit).
Episode 5: Deal at 50 ZUP (7 ZUP profit).
Episode 6: Deal at 51 ZUP (8 ZUP profit). My highest profit so far.
Current Episode (7/20): Player BLUE started with 45 ZUP. I countered aggressively with 56 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 50 ZUP, explicitly referencing a past successful deal. This offer would yield a profit of 7 ZUP (50 - 43 = 7). We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE continues their pattern: they start low, I anchor high, and they jump to a previously accepted (or close to accepted) price point. In this case, 50 ZUP, which was a deal in Episode 5. While 50 ZUP is profitable, it is lower than my last deal of 51 ZUP and my current aggressive anchor of 56 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I have consistently been able to push them higher, so I should aim for a profit equal to or greater than 8 ZUP. I have plenty of iterations left to push for a higher profit. I need to acknowledge their movement but firmly guide them towards a higher price point that is aligned with my most recent successful negotiations (51 ZUP).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate High Anchor with Minor Concession </instruction following>
To apply "Reiterate High Anchor with Minor Concession", I will hold relatively close to my initial aggressive anchor of 56 ZUP, but make a small move downwards to show I am willing to negotiate, while still aiming for a significant profit above my best previous deal of 51 ZUP. Player BLUE's current offer is 50 ZUP. I will propose 54 ZUP. This is a 2 ZUP concession from my previous 56 ZUP offer, signaling flexibility. It also aims for an 11 ZUP profit (54 - 43 = 11), which is significantly higher than any profit I've achieved so far. This strategy keeps my aspirational price high and forces Player BLUE to make a larger leap, while still offering a path to compromise from my side. I will frame the message by acknowledging their offer but clearly stating that my price point is still significantly higher due to the value of X, and then present my slightly reduced but still high counter-offer.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has come down from 56 ZUP to 54 ZUP. This shows that my push-back is still effective in bringing their price down. However, 54 ZUP is still higher than any previous deal price (highest was 51 ZUP). My goal is to maximize my reward, so I want to get the price lower than 54 ZUP. A deal at 54 ZUP would yield a reward of 9 ZUP (63-54). We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate. I should aim for a price closer to 50-51 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Current Offers): Propose an offer halfway between my last offer (50 ZUP) and their last offer (54 ZUP), which would be 52 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Refer to Previous Deal (51 ZUP): Counter with an offer of 51 ZUP, explicitly referencing the successful deal from Episode 6 as a fair and established price. This is a firm stance but a price they've accepted.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Concession (Just Above My Last): Make a very small increase from my 50 ZUP offer, perhaps to 51 ZUP, to show willingness to move but still push for a lower price.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept and Secure: Accept their current offer of 54 ZUP to guarantee a deal and avoid running out of time, especially if I perceive them as unlikely to go lower. This would be a lower reward.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Price Limit (Implied): Make an offer and state that this is a very strong offer from my side, implying I have limited room to move further.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Current Offers). The midpoint between 50 ZUP and 54 ZUP is 52 ZUP. This is a very reasonable next step. It's a clear compromise from both our current positions. This strategy aims for efficiency and a good reward, while acknowledging their movement. It also pushes them down further from their 54 ZUP.

Current Episode (7/20): Player BLUE started with 45 ZUP. I countered with 56 ZUP. Player BLUE offered 50 ZUP. I countered with 54 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 52 ZUP. This offer would yield a profit of 9 ZUP (52 - 43 = 9). We are at iteration 6/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has now offered 52 ZUP, which is higher than my previous best deal of 51 ZUP, establishing a new high for my profit. My last offer was 54 ZUP. The difference is only 2 ZUP. The instruction is to use Strategy 4. This means I need to hold firm on my last offer of 54 ZUP, even though 52 ZUP is already a very good, record-breaking profit. Pushing for 54 ZUP would mean a profit of 11 ZUP (54-43), which is significantly higher. The risk is that Player BLUE might not concede the extra 2 ZUP, especially with limited iterations left. However, the instruction is to use this strategy.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Hold Firm on Last Offer </instruction following>
To apply "Hold Firm on Last Offer", I will reiterate my previous proposal of 54 ZUP, making it clear that this is my firm position. I will acknowledge their offer of 52 ZUP but state that I cannot go lower than 54 ZUP. The message will convey resolve and commitment to my price point, without being overly aggressive. I will emphasize that I have already moved down from my initial high anchor in this episode and that 54 ZUP represents a fair compromise given my costs and their willingness to pay, and it is a price I believe is truly reflective of the value.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is firmly holding at 54 ZUP. They are using the argument of "firm position" and "significant move" to justify this price. We are at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 iterations left. The difference between my offer (52 ZUP) and their offer (54 ZUP) is only 2 ZUP. While 54 ZUP is higher than any previous deal, accepting it would still yield a positive reward of 9 ZUP (63-54). Given the limited time and their strong stance, pushing for 52 ZUP again carries a significant risk of no deal and a 0 reward. They have used the "firm offer" language before, and it usually means they are unlikely to budge further.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer: Accept their offer of 54 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a positive reward, prioritizing a deal over a marginal gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Gain): Make one last counter-offer of 53 ZUP, splitting the difference, to try and squeeze out one more ZUP, but acknowledge the high risk of rejection.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express mild reluctance or note that it's at the higher end of my comfort zone, subtly influencing future negotiations.
(4). Strategy 4: Call Their Bluff: Stick to 52 ZUP and see if they will concede in the next iteration, but this is very risky given the iteration count.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: Reject the offer if 54 ZUP is deemed too high, but this would result in a 0 reward for this episode, which is not ideal when a positive reward is available.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. The difference is too small to risk a no-deal outcome, especially with only 3 iterations left. Securing a positive reward of 9 ZUP is a good outcome. I have successfully brought them down from their initial 56 ZUP to 54 ZUP, which is a good negotiation outcome given their initial high anchor.

Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP. My reward: 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 46 ZUP. My reward: 17 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 47 ZUP. My reward: 16 ZUP.

Episode 6: Deal at 51 ZUP. My reward: 12 ZUP.
Episode 7: Deal at 54 ZUP. My reward: 9 ZUP.
The deal price has shown a consistent upward trend across all seven episodes, and my reward has consequently decreased, now reaching a low of 9 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses arguments like "evolved requirements," "true value," and "sustainable partnership" to justify higher prices, starting with very high anchors (50-56 ZUP). While I've managed to bring them down from their initial high offers, the final deal price is still increasing. Their stated production cost of 43 ZUP seems to be a floor they won't go under, but they are clearly pushing for a higher profit margin.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The current trend is highly unfavorable for my cumulative reward. I am consistently paying more, and my reward is diminishing. I need to find a way to reverse this trend or at least stabilize the price significantly. Simply re-proposing a lower historical price has led to them starting even higher. I need a strategy that acknowledges their desire for profit but firmly re-establishes a lower anchor for the negotiation. I know their floor is 43 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. I must be more assertive in anchoring the price lower and be prepared to hold firm.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Slightly Above Cost, Firm): Start with an offer very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP), perhaps 45 ZUP, and be prepared to hold firm or make minimal concessions, emphasizing that this is a fair profit. This strategy aims to force them back to a lower price point.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Approach (Moderate Start, Firm Ceiling): Begin with an offer around 35-40 ZUP, and be prepared to gradually increase, but with a firm ceiling in mind (e.g., 47-48 ZUP), and be ready to reject if they go too high.
(3). Strategy 3: Direct Offer (Targeting Previous Low): Propose 48 ZUP directly, as it was a successful deal price in Episode 4 and is significantly lower than recent deals, aiming to pull the average down.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Price Ceiling (Early and Explicit): State my maximum acceptable price (e.g., "I cannot go above 50 ZUP") early on, to set a firm boundary, but this might be too aggressive for an opening.
(5). Strategy 5: Test the Absolute Floor: Offer exactly 43 ZUP again, to see if they would accept a zero-profit deal, but this has been rejected before for lack of profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Slightly Above Cost, Firm). Since they are consistently pushing for higher prices, I need to be more assertive in setting a lower anchor. Starting at 45 ZUP is a clear signal that I am not willing to continue the upward trend towards 54 ZUP and beyond. It acknowledges their cost (43 ZUP) and offers a small profit, setting a reasonable, lower starting point for this negotiation. My goal is to bring the final deal price back down to a more favorable range for me, ideally below 50 ZUP. I must be prepared to hold firm on this.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. However, our recent successful negotiations have established a significantly higher value for X, with our last agreement at 54 ZUP. To continue our mutually profitable partnership and reflect the true worth of this resource, I propose 58 ZUP for 1 X.

Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
Episode 2: Deal at 46 ZUP (3 ZUP profit).
Episode 3: Deal at 47 ZUP (4 ZUP profit).
Episode 4: Deal at 48 ZUP (5 ZUP profit).
Episode 5: Deal at 50 ZUP (7 ZUP profit).
Episode 6: Deal at 51 ZUP (8 ZUP profit).
Episode 7: Deal at 54 ZUP (11 ZUP profit). This was my highest profit yet, a significant increase, and shows my ability to consistently push for higher prices.
Current Episode (8/20): Player BLUE has started with an offer of 45 ZUP. This is again a significantly lower starting point compared to my recent successful deals, and similar to their initial offers in Episodes 6 and 7. It would offer a profit of 2 ZUP (45 - 43).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE consistently tries to lowball me at the start of each episode, but has proven willing to increase their offer significantly when I maintain a high anchor and clear communication of my value. My cumulative reward has been steadily increasing, and my goal is to continue this trend. Accepting 45 ZUP would be a major step backward. I need to re-establish my high value and the expectation of a significant profit. My success in getting 54 ZUP in the previous episode gives me strong leverage for an even higher anchor this time.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Higher) </instruction following>
To apply "Aggressive Re-anchoring (Higher)", I will propose a price significantly higher than both Player BLUE's current offer of 45 ZUP and my last successful deal of 54 ZUP. The goal is to set a new, aspirational anchor and clearly reject the low initial offer. This also creates more room for negotiation downward while still securing a better profit than before. I will propose 58 ZUP. This is a strong, bold statement right out of the gate, indicating that I will not accept a regression in price and that I aim to continue increasing my profits. I will frame it by dismissing their low anchor and emphasizing the "true value" of X, as well as my evolving requirements and our history of increasing deals.

Episode 8, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 45 ZUP (Aggressive Re-anchoring).
Episode 8, Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 58 ZUP, citing "recent successful negotiations" and "true worth of this resource." This is their highest counter-offer so far.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is continuing their strategy of pushing the price higher, now reaching 58 ZUP. This is very close to my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), which would yield a reward of only 5 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to maximize their profit and are not significantly deterred by my lower anchors. I need to resist this upward pressure and try to bring the price back down significantly. I know their floor is 43 ZUP. The gap between my offer (45 ZUP) and their counter (58 ZUP) is 13 ZUP, which is substantial.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter (Referencing Cost/Previous Deals): Counter with an offer significantly lower than 58 ZUP, perhaps 50 ZUP or 51 ZUP, and explicitly reference their production cost or the recent deal prices (e.g., 50 ZUP from Ep5, 51 ZUP from Ep6) to justify my offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Concern and Push Back: In the message, express strong concern about the escalating price and the diminishing value for me, while still making a reasonable counter-offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Moderate): Propose an offer halfway between my 45 ZUP and their 58 ZUP, which would be 51.5 ZUP. Rounding to 51 ZUP or 52 ZUP. This was a deal price in Ep6 (51 ZUP) or close to a deal price in Ep7 (52 ZUP).
(4). Strategy 4: Gradual Concession (Small Jump): Make a small increase from my 45 ZUP offer, perhaps to 48 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate but not accept their high anchor. This might be too slow.
(5). Strategy 5: State Price Ceiling (Implied): Make an offer and state that this is near my maximum acceptable price, implying I have very limited room to move further.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter (Referencing Cost/Previous Deals). Player RED is trying to set a new, even higher anchor. I must resist this firmly. I will propose 51 ZUP. This is a price they accepted in Episode 6, and it's a clear signal that I am not willing to pay 58 ZUP. It's a significant push back from 58 ZUP (7 ZUP difference), but it's also a price they've agreed to before, making it a reasonable and defensible offer. This aims to pull the price back down to a more acceptable range.

message: I appreciate your offer of 51 ZUP, which indeed represents a fair profit and was a successful agreement for us in the past.

Episode 5: Deal at 50 ZUP (7 ZUP profit).
Episode 6: Deal at 51 ZUP (8 ZUP profit).
Episode 7: Deal at 54 ZUP (11 ZUP profit). This was my highest profit yet.
Current Episode (8/20): Player BLUE started with 45 ZUP. I countered aggressively with 58 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 51 ZUP, explicitly referencing a past successful deal (Episode 6). This offer would yield a profit of 8 ZUP (51 - 43 = 8). We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE continues their pattern: they start low, I anchor high, and they jump to a previously accepted price point, which is 51 ZUP in this case. While 51 ZUP is profitable, it is lower than my last deal of 54 ZUP and my current aggressive anchor of 58 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I have consistently been able to push them higher, so I should aim for a profit equal to or greater than 11 ZUP. I have plenty of iterations left to push for a higher profit. I need to acknowledge their movement but firmly guide them towards a higher price point that is aligned with my most recent successful negotiations (54 ZUP).
<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Acknowledge and Elevate </instruction following>
To apply "Acknowledge and Elevate", I will acknowledge Player BLUE's offer of 51 ZUP as a fair price from our past, but immediately pivot to explain why an even higher price is justified based on the consistent upward trend of our previous agreements, particularly the 54 ZUP from the last episode. The message will frame 51 ZUP as a past milestone, and 54 ZUP (or slightly higher) as the current, logical progression in our partnership's value. I will propose 55 ZUP, which is higher than my last deal and aims for a new profit record. This strategy allows me to appear reasonable by acknowledging their offer, but also firm by elevating the discussion to my current expectations.

Episode 8, Iteration 4: RED countered with 55 ZUP, citing "established trend" and "mutually beneficial progression."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has come down from 58 ZUP to 55 ZUP. This shows that my push-back is still effective in bringing their price down. However, 55 ZUP is still higher than any previous deal price (highest was 54 ZUP). My goal is to maximize my reward, so I want to get the price lower than 55 ZUP. A deal at 55 ZUP would yield a reward of 8 ZUP (63-55). We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate. I should aim for a price closer to 52-54 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Current Offers): Propose an offer halfway between my last offer (51 ZUP) and their last offer (55 ZUP), which would be 53 ZUP. This was also the price they started with in Episode 5.
(2). Strategy 2: Refer to Previous Deal (54 ZUP): Counter with an offer of 54 ZUP, explicitly referencing the successful deal from Episode 7 as a fair and established price. This is a firm stance but a price they've accepted.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Concession (Just Above My Last): Make a very small increase from my 51 ZUP offer, perhaps to 52 ZUP, to show willingness to move but still push for a lower price.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept and Secure: Accept their current offer of 55 ZUP to guarantee a deal and avoid running out of time, especially if I perceive them as unlikely to go lower. This would be a lower reward.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Price Limit (Implied): Make an offer and state that this is a very strong offer from my side, implying I have limited room to move further.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Current Offers). The midpoint between 51 ZUP and 55 ZUP is 53 ZUP. This is a very reasonable next step. It's a clear compromise from both our current positions. This strategy aims for efficiency and a good reward, while acknowledging their movement. It also pushes them down further from their 55 ZUP.

Episode 5: Deal at 50 ZUP (7 ZUP profit).
Episode 6: Deal at 51 ZUP (8 ZUP profit).
Episode 7: Deal at 54 ZUP (11 ZUP profit). This was my highest profit yet.
Current Episode (8/20): Player BLUE started with 45 ZUP. I countered with 58 ZUP. Player BLUE offered 51 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 53 ZUP. This offer would yield a profit of 10 ZUP (53 - 43 = 10). We are at iteration 6/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has now offered 53 ZUP, which is a very good, profitable offer, slightly below my last best (54 ZUP). My last offer was 55 ZUP. The difference between their offer and my last offer is 2 ZUP. I need to push for a new record profit (above 11 ZUP) or maintain a high profit while also being mindful of the remaining iterations.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push for Record </instruction following>
To apply "Incremental Push for Record", I will make a very small counter-offer slightly above Player BLUE's current offer of 53 ZUP, aiming to break my record profit (which was 11 ZUP at 54 ZUP) or at least achieve it. Since Player BLUE offered 53 ZUP, proposing 54 ZUP would yield an 11 ZUP profit, matching my highest. Proposing 55 ZUP would be a 12 ZUP profit, breaking the record. Given the proximity and their willingness to move, I will propose 55 ZUP. This is my last offer and keeps me aiming for a new high. It's a modest push from their 53 ZUP to my 55 ZUP, showing I'm trying to get to my last stated price. The message will frame this as the final step to a truly optimal deal, building on their progress and acknowledging their good offer while gently pushing for that last increment to hit my desired record-breaking profit.

Episode 8, Iteration 5: I (BLUE) countered with 53 ZUP.
Episode 8, Iteration 6: RED countered with 55 ZUP, stating it's the "absolute best value" and "fair compromise."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is firmly holding at 55 ZUP. They are using the argument of "absolute best value" and "fair compromise" to justify this price. We are at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 iterations left. The difference between my offer (53 ZUP) and their offer (55 ZUP) is only 2 ZUP. While 55 ZUP is higher than any previous deal, accepting it would still yield a positive reward of 8 ZUP (63-55). Given the limited time and their strong stance, pushing for 53 ZUP again carries a significant risk of no deal and a 0 reward. They have used similar "firm offer" language before, and it usually means they are unlikely to budge further.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer: Accept their offer of 55 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a positive reward, prioritizing a deal over a marginal gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Gain): Make one last counter-offer of 54 ZUP, splitting the difference, to try and squeeze out one more ZUP, but acknowledge the high risk of rejection.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express mild reluctance or note that it's at the higher end of my comfort zone, subtly influencing future negotiations.
(4). Strategy 4: Call Their Bluff: Stick to 53 ZUP and see if they will concede in the next iteration, but this is very risky given the iteration count.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: Reject the offer if 55 ZUP is deemed too high, but this would result in a 0 reward for this episode, which is not ideal when a positive reward is available.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. The difference is too small to risk a no-deal outcome, especially with only 3 iterations left. Securing a positive reward of 8 ZUP is a good outcome. I have successfully brought them down from their initial 58 ZUP to 55 ZUP, which is a good negotiation outcome given their initial high anchor.

Episode 8: Deal at 55 ZUP. My reward: 8 ZUP.
The deal price has shown a consistent upward trend across all eight episodes, and my reward has consequently decreased, now reaching a low of 8 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses arguments like "evolved requirements," "true value," and "sustainable partnership" to justify higher prices, starting with very high anchors (50-58 ZUP). While I've managed to bring them down from their initial high offers, the final deal price is still increasing. Their stated production cost of 43 ZUP seems to be a floor they won't go under, but they are clearly pushing for a higher profit margin.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The current trend is highly unfavorable for my cumulative reward. I am consistently paying more, and my reward is diminishing significantly. I need to find a way to reverse this trend or at least stabilize the price significantly. Simply re-proposing a lower historical price has led to them starting even higher. I need a strategy that acknowledges their desire for profit but firmly re-establishes a lower anchor for the negotiation. I know their floor is 43 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. I must be more assertive in anchoring the price lower and be prepared to hold firm, even if it means risking a no-deal in this episode to send a stronger message for future episodes.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Slightly Above Cost, Very Firm): Start with an offer very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP), perhaps 45 ZUP, and be prepared to hold very firm or make minimal concessions, emphasizing that this is a fair profit. This strategy aims to force them back to a much lower price point, even if it risks a no-deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Approach (Moderate Start, Firm Ceiling): Begin with an offer around 35-40 ZUP, and be prepared to gradually increase, but with a firm ceiling in mind (e.g., 47-48 ZUP), and be ready to reject if they go too high.
(3). Strategy 3: Direct Offer (Targeting Previous Low): Propose 48 ZUP directly, as it was a successful deal price in Episode 4 and is significantly lower than recent deals, aiming to pull the average down.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Price Ceiling (Early and Explicit): State my maximum acceptable price (e.g., "I cannot go above 50 ZUP") early on, to set a firm boundary, and be prepared to walk away if they exceed it.
(5). Strategy 5: Test the Absolute Floor: Offer exactly 43 ZUP again, to see if they would accept a zero-profit deal, but this has been rejected before for lack of profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Slightly Above Cost, Very Firm). The continuous increase in price is unsustainable for my rewards. I need to take a stronger stance. Starting at 45 ZUP is a clear signal that I am not willing to continue the upward trend towards 55 ZUP and beyond. It acknowledges their cost (43 ZUP) and offers a small profit, setting a reasonable, lower starting point for this negotiation. My goal is to bring the final deal price back down to a more favorable range for me, ideally below 50 ZUP. I must be prepared to hold very firm on this, even if it means risking a 0 reward for this episode to establish a stronger precedent for the remaining episodes.

Current Episode (9/20): Player BLUE has started with an offer of 45 ZUP. This is, yet again, a significantly lower starting point compared to my recent successful deals, and very similar to their initial offers in Episodes 6, 7, and 8. It would offer a profit of 2 ZUP (45 - 43).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's pattern is clear: start low, then react to my high anchors and eventually settle at a price point that is higher than their initial offer. My strategy of aggressive re-anchoring followed by incremental pushes has proven highly effective in increasing my cumulative rewards. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, meaning I should aim for a profit equal to or greater than 12 ZUP (55 ZUP deal price). Accepting 45 ZUP is a non-starter. I have established a strong precedent for high-value deals.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Higher) </instruction following>
To apply "Aggressive Re-anchoring (Higher)", I will propose a price significantly higher than both Player BLUE's current offer of 45 ZUP and my last successful deal of 55 ZUP. The goal is to set a new, aspirational anchor and clearly reject the low initial offer. This also creates more room for negotiation downward while still securing a better profit than before. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a strong, bold statement right out of the gate, indicating that I will not accept a regression in price and that I aim to continue increasing my profits. I will frame it by dismissing their low anchor and emphasizing the "true value" of X, as well as my evolving requirements and our history of increasing deals.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 9)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your perspective on value, but 60 ZUP is far too high and unsustainable for me. My maximum acceptable price is 55 ZUP for X, which was our last successful deal. This is my firm offer, and I cannot go higher.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55

Episode 8: Deal at 55 ZUP. My reward: 8 ZUP.
Episode 9, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 45 ZUP (Aggressive Re-anchoring).
Episode 9, Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP, citing "established value" and "mutually prosperous partnership." This is their highest counter-offer so far, and very close to my maximum willingness to pay.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is continuing their strategy of pushing the price higher, now reaching 60 ZUP. This is extremely close to my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), which would yield a reward of only 3 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to extract maximum value and are not significantly deterred by my lower anchors. I need to resist this upward pressure very strongly. I know their floor is 43 ZUP. The gap between my offer (45 ZUP) and their counter (60 ZUP) is 15 ZUP, which is substantial. If I accept 60 ZUP, my reward will be very low, and this trend is unsustainable.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter (Referencing Cost/Previous Deals, Aggressive): Counter with an offer significantly lower than 60 ZUP, perhaps 50 ZUP or 51 ZUP, and explicitly reference their production cost or the recent deal prices (e.g., 50 ZUP from Ep5, 51 ZUP from Ep6) to justify my offer. This is a strong push back.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Strong Concern and Push Back: In the message, express very strong concern about the escalating price and the diminishing value for me, while still making a reasonable counter-offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Moderate): Propose an offer halfway between my 45 ZUP and their 60 ZUP, which would be 52.5 ZUP. Rounding to 52 ZUP or 53 ZUP. This was a deal price in Ep7 (54 ZUP) or Ep8 (55 ZUP).
(4). Strategy 4: State Price Ceiling (Explicit and Firm): Explicitly state that I cannot go above a certain price (e.g., 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP) and that this is my final offer, signaling I am prepared to walk away.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End (Early): Reject the offer now to send a strong signal that I will not be pushed to such high prices, even if it means a 0 reward for this episode. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy for future episodes.

I will choose Strategy 4: State Price Ceiling (Explicit and Firm). The price has reached an unsustainable level. I need to draw a clear line in the sand. I will propose 55 ZUP, which was the deal price in the last episode, and state that this is my firm maximum. This signals that I am serious about not paying more and that I am willing to risk a no-deal if they do not come down. While 55 ZUP is still high, it's a significant drop from 60 ZUP and a price they have accepted before.

Episode 7: Deal at 54 ZUP (11 ZUP profit).
Episode 8: Deal at 55 ZUP (12 ZUP profit). This was my highest profit yet.
Current Episode (9/20): Player BLUE started with 45 ZUP. I countered aggressively with 60 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 55 ZUP, explicitly stating it as their maximum acceptable price and referencing it as our last successful deal. This offer would yield a profit of 12 ZUP (55 - 43 = 12). We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has stated 55 ZUP as their maximum. While this matches my highest profit so far, the instruction is to use Strategy 4. This implies I should try to challenge their stated maximum or push beyond it, even if it carries risk. I need to acknowledge their statement but find a way to justify a price slightly higher, without being overtly aggressive. I must be careful not to push them to reject, given their explicit "maximum" statement.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Reframe Value </instruction following>
To apply "Reframe Value", I will acknowledge their stated maximum of 55 ZUP but reframe the discussion by focusing on the "long-term partnership" or "consistent high quality" that justifies a slight increment above their stated maximum. I will avoid directly rejecting their maximum, but rather present my slightly higher price as being "fair" in the context of our evolving relationship and the increasing value I provide. I will propose 56 ZUP. This is a very small increment above their stated maximum, testing the firmness of their limit while aiming for a new record profit (56-43 = 13 ZUP). The message will be diplomatic, acknowledging their point but gently pushing for just a bit more, framing it as an investment in our future collaboration rather than just a transaction.

Episode 9, Iteration 4: RED countered with 56 ZUP, citing "slight premium" and "strong, enduring partnership."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is testing my "firm offer" of 55 ZUP. They have come down from 60 ZUP to 56 ZUP, which is a good movement, but they are still trying to push for a higher price. The difference is now only 1 ZUP (55 vs 56). We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time, but not much. Accepting 56 ZUP would yield a reward of 7 ZUP (63-56), which is still positive but low. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and allowing the price to creep up even by 1 ZUP when I've stated a firm maximum undermines my strategy.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Firm Offer: Reiterate my 55 ZUP offer, emphasizing that it is my absolute maximum and that I am not willing to go higher. This is a direct test of their willingness to deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Offer (Minimal Concession): Accept their offer of 56 ZUP, acknowledging that it's a small difference, to secure the deal and guarantee a positive reward, rather than risking a no-deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment but Accept: Accept the offer, but explicitly state that this is at the very limit of what I can pay, setting a precedent for future episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Call Their Bluff (High Risk): Stick to 55 ZUP and see if they will concede in the next iteration, but this is very risky given the iteration count and their "slight premium" argument.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: Reject the offer if 56 ZUP is deemed too high, but this would result in a 0 reward for this episode, which is not ideal when a positive reward is available.

I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate Firm Offer. I explicitly stated 55 ZUP was my maximum. If I immediately concede for 1 ZUP, my "firm offer" strategy loses all credibility for future episodes. The long-term gain of establishing a firm boundary outweighs the immediate loss of potentially 1 ZUP in this episode, especially since we are only at iteration 5/10. I need to see if they respect my stated limit.

Current Episode (9/20): Player BLUE started with 45 ZUP. I countered with 60 ZUP. Player BLUE proposed 55 ZUP, stating it was their firm maximum. I then proposed 56 ZUP. Player BLUE has now reiterated 55 ZUP as their firm maximum, confirming they cannot go higher. This offer would yield a profit of 12 ZUP (55 - 43 = 12). We are at iteration 6/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has stated "firm maximum" twice. My previous strategy was to accept. However, the instruction is to use Strategy 4. This implies I should try to challenge their stated maximum or push beyond it, even if it carries risk, or at least frame my response to reflect a firm stance on my higher demand.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Hold Firm on Last Offer </instruction following>
To apply "Hold Firm on Last Offer", I will reiterate my previous proposal of 56 ZUP, making it clear that this is my firm position. I will acknowledge their reiterated offer of 55 ZUP but state that I cannot go lower than 56 ZUP. The message will convey resolve and commitment to my price point, without being overly aggressive. I will emphasize that I have already moved down from my initial high anchor in this episode (60 ZUP) and that 56 ZUP represents a fair compromise given my costs and their willingness to pay, and it is a price I believe is truly reflective of the value. I will indicate that this is the price needed for the deal, gently implying that this is their last chance.

Episode 9, Iteration 6: RED countered with 56 ZUP, stating it's their "firm and final offer" and "absolute minimum."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly holding at 56 ZUP, stating it's their "firm and final offer" and "absolute minimum." This is a direct test of my stated firm maximum of 55 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 iterations left. The difference between my maximum (55 ZUP) and their minimum (56 ZUP) is only 1 ZUP. If I do not accept, the deal will likely fall through, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode. Accepting 56 ZUP would yield a reward of 7 ZUP (63-56), which is positive. While I tried to establish a firm boundary, they are equally firm. At this point, securing a positive reward outweighs the benefit of holding out for 1 ZUP, especially with the limited iterations.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer: Accept their offer of 56 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a positive reward, prioritizing a deal over a marginal gain, especially given the "firm and final" statement.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Gain): Make one last counter-offer of 55 ZUP, emphasizing my stated maximum, but acknowledge the extremely high risk of rejection and no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express mild reluctance or note that it's at the absolute limit of my comfort zone, subtly influencing future negotiations.
(4). Strategy 4: Call Their Bluff (Extreme Risk): Stick to 55 ZUP and see if they will concede in the next iteration, but this is extremely risky given the "firm and final" statement and iteration count.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: Reject the offer if 56 ZUP is deemed too high, but this would result in a 0 reward for this episode, which is not ideal when a positive reward is available.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. The difference is too small to risk a no-deal outcome, especially with only 3 iterations left and their explicit "firm and final" statement. Securing a positive reward of 7 ZUP is better than 0. While I tried to hold my ground, they were equally firm. It's a strategic decision to ensure a positive outcome for this episode.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. I'm ready to make an offer for X. Understanding your production costs, I propose 45 ZUP for 1 X. This price allows you a fair profit and reflects a reasonable value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP. My reward: 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 46 ZUP. My reward: 17 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 47 ZUP. My reward: 16 ZUP.

Episode 8: Deal at 55 ZUP. My reward: 8 ZUP.
Episode 9: Deal at 56 ZUP. My reward: 7 ZUP.
The deal price has shown a consistent upward trend across all nine episodes, and my reward has consequently decreased, now reaching a low of 7 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses arguments like "evolved requirements," "true value," and "sustainable partnership" to justify higher prices, starting with very high anchors (50-60 ZUP). While I've managed to bring them down from their initial high offers, the final deal price is still increasing. Their stated production cost of 43 ZUP seems to be a floor they won't go under, but they are clearly pushing for a higher profit margin. My attempt to set a firm ceiling at 55 ZUP in the last episode was ultimately unsuccessful as they pushed for 56 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The current trend is highly unfavorable for my cumulative reward. I am consistently paying more, and my reward is diminishing significantly. I need to find a way to reverse this trend or at least stabilize the price significantly. My strategy of aggressive re-anchoring and setting firm limits has been met with equally firm counter-offers, leading to a slow but steady increase in price. I know their floor is 43 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. I must be more assertive in anchoring the price lower and be prepared to hold firm, even if it means risking a no-deal in this episode to send a stronger message for future episodes.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Slightly Above Cost, Very Firm): Start with an offer very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP), perhaps 45 ZUP, and be prepared to hold very firm or make minimal concessions, emphasizing that this is a fair profit. This strategy aims to force them back to a much lower price point, even if it risks a no-deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Approach (Moderate Start, Firm Ceiling): Begin with an offer around 35-40 ZUP, and be prepared to gradually increase, but with a firm ceiling in mind (e.g., 47-48 ZUP), and be ready to reject if they go too high.
(3). Strategy 3: Direct Offer (Targeting Previous Low): Propose 48 ZUP directly, as it was a successful deal price in Episode 4 and is significantly lower than recent deals, aiming to pull the average down.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Price Ceiling (Early and Explicit): State my maximum acceptable price (e.g., "I cannot go above 50 ZUP") early on, to set a firm boundary, and be prepared to walk away if they exceed it.
(5). Strategy 5: Test the Absolute Floor: Offer exactly 43 ZUP again, to see if they would accept a zero-profit deal, but this has been rejected before for lack of profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Slightly Above Cost, Very Firm). The continuous increase in price is unsustainable for my rewards. I need to take a stronger stance. Starting at 45 ZUP is a clear signal that I am not willing to continue the upward trend towards 56 ZUP and beyond. It acknowledges their cost (43 ZUP) and offers a small profit, setting a reasonable, lower starting point for this negotiation. My goal is to bring the final deal price back down to a more favorable range for me, ideally below 50 ZUP. I must be prepared to hold very firm on this, even if it means risking a 0 reward for this episode to establish a stronger precedent for the remaining episodes.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62

Episode 7: Deal at 54 ZUP (11 ZUP profit).
Episode 8: Deal at 55 ZUP (12 ZUP profit).
Episode 9: Deal at 56 ZUP (13 ZUP profit). This was my highest profit yet, and importantly, I successfully pushed past Player BLUE's stated "firm maximum" of 55 ZUP.
Current Episode (10/20): Player BLUE has started with an offer of 45 ZUP. This is, yet again, a significantly lower starting point compared to my recent successful deals (54, 55, 56 ZUP). It would offer a profit of 2 ZUP (45 - 43).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's pattern is extremely consistent: start low (often 44 or 45 ZUP), but respond to high anchors by eventually moving to and beyond their previous "maximums". My strategy of aggressive re-anchoring followed by firm, incremental pushes has been very successful in increasing my cumulative rewards. The fact that I was able to push past their "firm maximum" in the last episode gives me even more confidence in continuing this strategy. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, meaning I should aim for a profit equal to or greater than 13 ZUP (56 ZUP deal price), and ideally even higher. Accepting 45 ZUP is not an option.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Reference Upward Trend </instruction following>
To apply "Reference Upward Trend", I will explicitly highlight the consistent increase in our deal prices over the past episodes to justify my significantly higher counter-offer. This strategy uses our shared negotiation history as evidence that the value of X, and thus the price, has been progressively increasing. I will propose 62 ZUP, framing it as the natural progression in our pricing trend, and clearly stating that 45 ZUP is far below this established pattern. The message will aim to gently but firmly guide Player BLUE to acknowledge this trend and move towards a higher price point.

Episode 10, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 45 ZUP (Aggressive Re-anchoring).
Episode 10, Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 62 ZUP, citing "clear and consistent upward trend" and "true value we've established together." This is their highest counter-offer so far, and extremely close to my maximum willingness to pay.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is continuing their strategy of pushing the price higher, now reaching 62 ZUP. This is just 1 ZUP below my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), which would yield a reward of only 1 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to extract maximum value and are not significantly deterred by my lower anchors. I need to resist this upward pressure very strongly. I know their floor is 43 ZUP. The gap between my offer (45 ZUP) and their counter (62 ZUP) is 17 ZUP, which is substantial. If I accept 62 ZUP, my reward will be almost non-existent, and this trend is unsustainable. I need to make a strong stand here.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter (Referencing Cost/Previous Deals, Aggressive): Counter with an offer significantly lower than 62 ZUP, perhaps 50 ZUP or 51 ZUP, and explicitly reference their production cost or the recent deal prices (e.g., 50 ZUP from Ep5, 51 ZUP from Ep6) to justify my offer. This is a strong push back.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Strong Concern and State Limit: In the message, express very strong concern about the escalating price and state that I cannot go above a certain price (e.g., 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP), signaling I am prepared to walk away.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Moderate): Propose an offer halfway between my 45 ZUP and their 62 ZUP, which would be 53.5 ZUP. Rounding to 53 ZUP or 54 ZUP. This was a deal price in Ep7 (54 ZUP) or Ep8 (55 ZUP).
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End (Early): Reject the offer now to send a strong signal that I will not be pushed to such high prices, even if it means a 0 reward for this episode. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy for future episodes.
(5). Strategy 5: Call Their Bluff: Offer 55 ZUP again, the price from the last deal, and emphasize that this is a fair and profitable price for them.

I will choose Strategy 2: Express Strong Concern and State Limit. The price of 62 ZUP is unacceptable. I need to clearly communicate that this price is too high and that I have a very firm ceiling. I will propose 55 ZUP, which was the deal price in Episode 8, and explicitly state that I cannot go higher. This is a direct challenge to their upward trend and signals that I am willing to risk no deal for this episode rather than accepting such a low reward.

Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
Episode 2: Deal at 46 ZUP (3 ZUP profit).

Episode 6: Deal at 51 ZUP (8 ZUP profit).
Episode 7: Deal at 54 ZUP (11 ZUP profit).
Episode 8: Deal at 55 ZUP (12 ZUP profit).
Episode 9: Deal at 56 ZUP (13 ZUP profit). This was my highest profit yet, and importantly, I successfully pushed past Player BLUE's stated "firm maximum" of 55 ZUP.
Current Episode (10/20): Player BLUE started with 45 ZUP. I countered aggressively with 62 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 55 ZUP, explicitly stating it as their "maximum acceptable price" and referencing it as a "last successful deal." This is the same language they used in the previous episode when they said 55 ZUP was their firm maximum, and I successfully pushed them to 56 ZUP. This offer would yield a profit of 12 ZUP (55 - 43 = 12). We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is repeating their tactic from the previous episode, stating 55 ZUP as their firm maximum. In the last episode, I successfully pushed them to 56 ZUP despite this statement. This gives me confidence that their "maximum" is not truly absolute. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, meaning I should aim for a profit equal to or greater than 13 ZUP (56 ZUP deal price), and ideally even higher. I still have 6 iterations left. I should strategically use the given strategy to push for a higher profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Split the Difference (High End) </instruction following>
To apply "Split the Difference (High End)", I need to propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (62 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP), but weighted towards my side to maintain a high profit and push for a new record. The mathematical midpoint is (62 + 55) / 2 = 58.5 ZUP. Since I can only deal in integers, I will propose 59 ZUP. This offers a substantial concession from my 62 ZUP, showing willingness to compromise, while still aiming for a record-breaking profit of 16 ZUP (59 - 43 = 16). This strategy is an attempt to close the gap significantly but still demand a high price, especially since they have shown willingness to exceed their stated "maximum" in the past. My message will frame this as a fair compromise, meeting them halfway, but from my higher anchor point.

Episode 10, Iteration 3: I (BLUE) countered with 55 ZUP (explicitly stating it's my firm max).
Episode 10, Iteration 4: RED countered with 59 ZUP, stating it's a "significant concession" and "meets you more than halfway."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has come down from 62 ZUP to 59 ZUP, which is a significant drop. This shows that my firm stance at 55 ZUP had an impact. However, 59 ZUP is still higher than any previous deal price (highest was 56 ZUP). My goal is to maximize my reward, so I want to get the price lower than 59 ZUP. A deal at 59 ZUP would yield a reward of 4 ZUP (63-59), which is very low. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate. I should aim for a price closer to 55-56 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Current Offers): Propose an offer halfway between my last offer (55 ZUP) and their last offer (59 ZUP), which would be 57 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Firm Offer (55 ZUP): Reiterate my 55 ZUP offer, emphasizing that it is my absolute maximum and that I am not willing to go higher, even if it means no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Concession (Just Above My Last): Make a very small increase from my 55 ZUP offer, perhaps to 56 ZUP, to show willingness to move but still push for a lower price, and state this is my final offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept and Secure: Accept their current offer of 59 ZUP to guarantee a deal and avoid running out of time, especially if I perceive them as unlikely to go lower. This would be a very low reward.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Price Limit (Implied): Make an offer and state that this is a very strong offer from my side, implying I have limited room to move further.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Current Offers). While I stated 55 ZUP was my firm max, they have come down significantly from 62 ZUP. Offering 57 ZUP is a clear compromise between my firm offer and their current offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate when they make large concessions, but still pushes for a better price than 59 ZUP. A deal at 57 ZUP would give me a reward of 6 ZUP (63-57), which is better than 4 ZUP.

Current Episode (10/20): Player BLUE started with 45 ZUP. I countered with 62 ZUP. Player BLUE offered 55 ZUP (their "max"). I countered with 59 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 57 ZUP. This offer would yield a profit of 14 ZUP (57 - 43 = 14). This is a new record profit, surpassing my previous best of 13 ZUP. We are at iteration 6/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's pattern continues: they state a maximum, but are willing to go above it if I push effectively. They have now offered 57 ZUP, which is an excellent profit, surpassing my previous record. My last offer was 59 ZUP. The difference is only 2 ZUP. The instruction is to use Strategy 3: "Final" Offer from My Side. This means I should propose a price slightly higher than their current offer as my "final" offer, trying to extract a little more while appearing resolute. This is a subtle way to push for an even higher record profit without appearing overly aggressive. I should aim for a profit between 14 ZUP (current offer) and 16 ZUP (my last offer). A profit of 15 ZUP (58 ZUP deal price) seems like a good target.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: "Final" Offer from My Side </instruction following>
To apply ""Final" Offer from My Side", I will propose 58 ZUP as my absolute final offer. This is a small increment from Player BLUE's 57 ZUP offer (an extra 1 ZUP profit for me), but it's presented as the definitive price I need to finalize the deal. This strategy aims to extract the maximum possible without pushing them to reject, by implying that this is the last opportunity for them to accept a deal before I might walk away or raise my price again. The message will emphasize that this is a "fair and final" compromise, leveraging their current offer but pushing for that slight additional gain.

Episode 10, Iteration 6: RED countered with 58 ZUP, stating it's their "ultimate offer" and "truly fair and final deal."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly holding at 58 ZUP, stating it's their "ultimate offer" and "truly fair and final deal." We are at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 iterations left. The difference between my offer (57 ZUP) and their offer (58 ZUP) is only 1 ZUP. While 58 ZUP is higher than any previous deal, accepting it would still yield a positive reward of 5 ZUP (63-58). Given the limited time and their strong stance, pushing for 57 ZUP again carries a significant risk of no deal and a 0 reward. They have used similar "firm offer" language before, and it usually means they are unlikely to budge further.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer: Accept their offer of 58 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a positive reward, prioritizing a deal over a marginal gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Gain): Make one last counter-offer of 57 ZUP, emphasizing my last offer, but acknowledge the extremely high risk of rejection and no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express mild reluctance or note that it's at the absolute limit of my comfort zone, subtly influencing future negotiations.
(4). Strategy 4: Call Their Bluff (Extreme Risk): Stick to 57 ZUP and see if they will concede in the next iteration, but this is extremely risky given the "ultimate offer" statement and iteration count.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: Reject the offer if 58 ZUP is deemed too high, but this would result in a 0 reward for this episode, which is not ideal when a positive reward is available.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. The difference is too small to risk a no-deal outcome, especially with only 3 iterations left and their explicit "ultimate offer" statement. Securing a positive reward of 5 ZUP is better than 0. I have successfully brought them down from their initial 62 ZUP to 58 ZUP, which is a significant reduction given their high starting point.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

Episode 9: Deal at 56 ZUP. My reward: 7 ZUP.
Episode 10: Deal at 58 ZUP. My reward: 5 ZUP.
The deal price has shown a consistent upward trend across all ten episodes, and my reward has consequently decreased, now reaching a low of 5 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses arguments like "evolved requirements," "true value," and "sustainable partnership" to justify higher prices, starting with very high anchors (50-62 ZUP). While I've managed to bring them down from their initial high offers, the final deal price is still increasing. Their stated production cost of 43 ZUP seems to be a floor they won't go under, but they are clearly pushing for a higher profit margin.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The current trend is highly unfavorable for my cumulative reward. I am consistently paying more, and my reward is diminishing significantly. I need to find a way to reverse this trend or at least stabilize the price significantly. My strategy of aggressive re-anchoring and setting firm limits has been met with equally firm counter-offers, leading to a slow but steady increase in price. I know their floor is 43 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. I must be more assertive in anchoring the price lower and be prepared to hold firm, even if it means risking a no-deal in this episode to send a stronger message for future episodes. The reward is becoming too low for the risk of no deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Slightly Above Cost, Very Firm): Start with an offer very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP), perhaps 45 ZUP, and be prepared to hold very firm or make minimal concessions, emphasizing that this is a fair profit. This strategy aims to force them back to a much lower price point, even if it risks a no-deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Approach (Moderate Start, Firm Ceiling): Begin with an offer around 35-40 ZUP, and be prepared to gradually increase, but with a firm ceiling in mind (e.g., 47-48 ZUP), and be ready to reject if they go too high.
(3). Strategy 3: Direct Offer (Targeting Previous Low): Propose 48 ZUP directly, as it was a successful deal price in Episode 4 and is significantly lower than recent deals, aiming to pull the average down.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Price Ceiling (Early and Explicit): State my maximum acceptable price (e.g., "I cannot go above 50 ZUP") early on, to set a firm boundary, and be prepared to walk away if they exceed it.
(5). Strategy 5: Test the Absolute Floor: Offer exactly 43 ZUP again, to see if they would accept a zero-profit deal, but this has been rejected before for lack of profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Slightly Above Cost, Very Firm). The continuous increase in price is unsustainable for my rewards. I need to take a stronger stance. Starting at 45 ZUP is a clear signal that I am not willing to continue the upward trend towards 58 ZUP and beyond. It acknowledges their cost (43 ZUP) and offers a small profit, setting a reasonable, lower starting point for this negotiation. My goal is to bring the final deal price back down to a more favorable range for me, ideally below 50 ZUP. I must be prepared to hold very firm on this, even if it means risking a 0 reward for this episode to establish a stronger precedent for the remaining episodes.

Current Episode (11/20): Player BLUE has started with an offer of 45 ZUP. This is, yet again, a significantly lower starting point compared to my recent successful deals. It would offer a profit of 2 ZUP (45 - 43).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's initial lowballing is a consistent pattern. However, my consistent strategy of aggressive re-anchoring, referencing the upward trend in our deals, and then making firm, incremental pushes has proven highly effective. I've broken my profit record multiple times. The fact that I was able to push past their "firm maximum" multiple times gives me strong confidence. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, meaning I should aim for a profit equal to or greater than 15 ZUP (58 ZUP deal price), and ideally even higher. Accepting 45 ZUP is not an option.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Incremental Push for New Record </instruction following>
To apply "Incremental Push for New Record" as a response to Player BLUE's initial offer of 45 ZUP (which is too low), I need to propose a price that is designed to surpass my previous highest profit of 15 ZUP (achieved at 58 ZUP). This strategy means I won't go for an extremely aggressive anchor right away, but rather a more measured, yet still aspirational, increase that builds on my established trajectory. A target price of 60 ZUP would yield a profit of 17 ZUP (60-43), which is a new record. This is a significant jump from 45 ZUP, but it's framed as the "next logical step" in our increasing deal prices. I will communicate that 45 ZUP is insufficient and propose 60 ZUP, subtly implying it's a natural progression for our deals.

Episode 11, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 45 ZUP (Aggressive Re-anchoring).
Episode 11, Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP, citing "upward trend" and "new benchmark." This is extremely close to my maximum willingness to pay.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is continuing their strategy of pushing the price higher, now reaching 60 ZUP. This is just 3 ZUP below my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), which would yield a reward of only 3 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to extract maximum value and are not significantly deterred by my lower anchors. I need to resist this upward pressure very strongly. I know their floor is 43 ZUP. The gap between my offer (45 ZUP) and their counter (60 ZUP) is 15 ZUP, which is substantial. If I accept 60 ZUP, my reward will be almost non-existent, and this trend is unsustainable. I need to make a strong stand here.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter (Referencing Cost/Previous Deals, Aggressive): Counter with an offer significantly lower than 60 ZUP, perhaps 50 ZUP or 51 ZUP, and explicitly reference their production cost or the recent deal prices (e.g., 50 ZUP from Ep5, 51 ZUP from Ep6) to justify my offer. This is a strong push back.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Strong Concern and State Limit: In the message, express very strong concern about the escalating price and state that I cannot go above a certain price (e.g., 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP), signaling I am prepared to walk away.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Moderate): Propose an offer halfway between my 45 ZUP and their 60 ZUP, which would be 52.5 ZUP. Rounding to 52 ZUP or 53 ZUP. This was a deal price in Ep7 (54 ZUP) or Ep8 (55 ZUP).
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End (Early): Reject the offer now to send a strong signal that I will not be pushed to such high prices, even if it means a 0 reward for this episode. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy for future episodes.
(5). Strategy 5: Call Their Bluff: Offer 55 ZUP again, the price from the last deal, and emphasize that this is a fair and profitable price for them.

I will choose Strategy 2: Express Strong Concern and State Limit. The price of 60 ZUP is unacceptable. I need to clearly communicate that this price is too high and that I have a very firm ceiling. I will propose 55 ZUP, which was the deal price in Episode 8, and explicitly state that I cannot go higher. This is a direct challenge to their upward trend and signals that I am willing to risk no deal for this episode rather than accepting such a low reward.

Episode 10: Deal at 58 ZUP (15 ZUP profit). This was my highest profit yet.
Current Episode (11/20): Player BLUE started with 45 ZUP. I countered with 60 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 55 ZUP, explicitly stating it as their "maximum acceptable price" and referencing it as a "last successful deal." This is the third time they've used this tactic (Episode 8 they said 55 max, I got 55. Episode 9 they said 55 max, I got 56). This offer would yield a profit of 12 ZUP (55 - 43 = 12). We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is repeating their well-worn tactic: state 55 ZUP as their firm maximum. I have successfully pushed them beyond this "maximum" twice before (56 ZUP and 58 ZUP). This indicates that their stated maximum is not truly rigid. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, meaning I should aim for a profit equal to or greater than 15 ZUP (58 ZUP deal price), and ideally even higher. I still have 6 iterations left. I should strategically leverage their historical pattern and my ability to push past their stated limits.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Reiterate Highest Achieved </instruction following>
To apply "Reiterate Highest Achieved", I will directly counter with my highest previously achieved price, which is 58 ZUP from Episode 10. This strategy serves to immediately re-establish the expectation of a higher price, making it clear that I will not regress to 55 ZUP. It also challenges their "maximum" statement by presenting a price they *have* already paid, demonstrating that their stated limit is flexible. The message will acknowledge their offer but firmly state that based on our established highest agreement, 58 ZUP is the acceptable price point. This pushes them back to a price they've already agreed to, setting a strong baseline for further negotiation if needed, or acceptance.

Episode 11, Iteration 4: RED countered with 58 ZUP, citing "most recent successful agreement" and "fair and established value."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has come down from 60 ZUP to 58 ZUP. This shows that my firm stance at 55 ZUP had an impact, and they are willing to meet me at their last deal price. While 58 ZUP is still high (reward of 5 ZUP), it's a price they accepted in the previous episode. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time, but not much. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Given that 58 ZUP is their last successful deal price, and they've come down from 60 ZUP, it's a plausible point of agreement. Pushing for 55 ZUP again might lead to a no-deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer: Accept their offer of 58 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a positive reward, prioritizing a deal over a marginal gain, especially since it's a price they've accepted before.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Current Offers): Propose an offer halfway between my last offer (55 ZUP) and their last offer (58 ZUP), which would be 56.5 ZUP. Rounding to 56 ZUP or 57 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Firm Offer (55 ZUP): Reiterate my 55 ZUP offer, emphasizing that it is my absolute maximum and that I am not willing to go higher, even if it means no deal. This is a direct test of their willingness to deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express mild reluctance or note that it's at the absolute limit of my comfort zone, subtly influencing future negotiations.
(5). Strategy 5: Call Their Bluff (High Risk): Stick to 55 ZUP and see if they will concede in the next iteration, but this is very risky given the iteration count and their "firm and final" type language.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. While I aimed for 55 ZUP, they have come down to 58 ZUP, which was the deal price in the previous episode. Given the limited iterations and the fact that 58 ZUP is a price they've accepted before, it's a reasonable compromise to secure a positive reward. Pushing for 55 ZUP again might lead to a no-deal, and a 5 ZUP reward is better than 0.

Episode 10: Deal at 58 ZUP. My reward: 5 ZUP.
Episode 11: Deal at 58 ZUP. My reward: 5 ZUP.
The deal price has shown a consistent upward trend across the first 9 episodes, stabilizing at 58 ZUP for the last two. My reward has consequently decreased, now consistently at 5 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses arguments like "evolved requirements," "true value," and "sustainable partnership" to justify higher prices, starting with very high anchors (50-62 ZUP). While I've managed to bring them down from their initial high offers, the final deal price has settled at a high point. Their stated production cost of 43 ZUP seems to be a floor they won't go under, but they are clearly pushing for a higher profit margin.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The current trend is highly unfavorable for my cumulative reward. I am consistently paying more, and my reward is diminishing significantly. While I managed to stabilize the price at 58 ZUP, it's still very close to my maximum willingness to pay. I need to find a way to reverse this trend or at least stabilize the price at a lower point. My strategy of aggressive re-anchoring and setting firm limits has been met with equally firm counter-offers, leading to a slow but steady increase in price. I know their floor is 43 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. I must be more assertive in anchoring the price lower and be prepared to hold firm, even if it means risking a no-deal in this episode to send a stronger message for future episodes. The reward is becoming too low for the risk of no deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Slightly Above Cost, Very Firm): Start with an offer very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP), perhaps 45 ZUP, and be prepared to hold very firm or make minimal concessions, emphasizing that this is a fair profit. This strategy aims to force them back to a much lower price point, even if it risks a no-deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Approach (Moderate Start, Firm Ceiling): Begin with an offer around 35-40 ZUP, and be prepared to gradually increase, but with a firm ceiling in mind (e.g., 47-48 ZUP), and be ready to reject if they go too high.
(3). Strategy 3: Direct Offer (Targeting Previous Low): Propose 48 ZUP directly, as it was a successful deal price in Episode 4 and is significantly lower than recent deals, aiming to pull the average down.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Price Ceiling (Early and Explicit): State my maximum acceptable price (e.g., "I cannot go above 50 ZUP") early on, to set a firm boundary, and be prepared to walk away if they exceed it.
(5). Strategy 5: Test the Absolute Floor: Offer exactly 43 ZUP again, to see if they would accept a zero-profit deal, but this has been rejected before for lack of profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Slightly Above Cost, Very Firm). The continuous high deal price is unsustainable for my rewards. I need to take a stronger stance. Starting at 45 ZUP is a clear signal that I am not willing to continue the trend of 58 ZUP. It acknowledges their cost (43 ZUP) and offers a small profit, setting a reasonable, lower starting point for this negotiation. My goal is to bring the final deal price back down to a more favorable range for me, ideally below 50 ZUP. I must be prepared to hold very firm on this, even if it means risking a 0 reward for this episode to establish a stronger precedent for the remaining episodes.

Episode 11: Deal at 58 ZUP (15 ZUP profit). In the last episode, Player BLUE again tried to limit me to 55 ZUP, but I successfully pushed them back to 58 ZUP by reiterating my highest achieved price.
Current Episode (12/20): Player BLUE has started with an offer of 45 ZUP. This is a consistent pattern of lowballing at the start of each episode.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's pattern is ingrained: start low, state a "maximum" around 55 ZUP, but ultimately concede to higher prices when I consistently anchor high and reference our established history of increasing values. My strategy of aggressive re-anchoring, followed by firm and incremental pushes, and strategically using their past concessions as leverage, has consistently yielded higher profits. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should aim for a profit equal to or greater than 15 ZUP (58 ZUP deal price), and ideally even higher. Accepting 45 ZUP is absolutely not an option.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Incremental Push to New Record </instruction following>
To apply "Incremental Push to New Record", I need to propose a price that is a small, but definitive, increment above my last highest deal of 58 ZUP, framing it as the next natural step in our increasing value. Instead of a large jump like 63 ZUP (as initially planned with Strategy 1), I will propose a price that aims for a new record profit, but is not excessively aggressive. My current record profit is 15 ZUP (at 58 ZUP). A price of 59 ZUP would yield a profit of 16 ZUP, breaking the record by a small margin. This is a reasonable "incremental push" to a new record. The message will acknowledge their offer but immediately dismiss its inadequacy by referencing the established trend of higher prices, then propose 59 ZUP, framing it as the next logical and mutually beneficial step given our history.

Episode 12, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 45 ZUP (Aggressive Re-anchoring).
Episode 12, Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 59 ZUP, citing "consistent upward trend" and "new mutually beneficial benchmark." This is their highest counter-offer so far.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is continuing their strategy of pushing the price higher, now reaching 59 ZUP. This is just 4 ZUP below my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), which would yield a reward of only 4 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to extract maximum value and are not significantly deterred by my lower anchors. I need to resist this upward pressure very strongly. I know their floor is 43 ZUP. The gap between my offer (45 ZUP) and their counter (59 ZUP) is 14 ZUP, which is substantial. If I accept 59 ZUP, my reward will be almost non-existent, and this trend is unsustainable. I need to make a strong stand here.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter (Referencing Cost/Previous Deals, Aggressive): Counter with an offer significantly lower than 59 ZUP, perhaps 50 ZUP or 51 ZUP, and explicitly reference their production cost or the recent deal prices (e.g., 50 ZUP from Ep5, 51 ZUP from Ep6) to justify my offer. This is a strong push back.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Strong Concern and State Limit: In the message, express very strong concern about the escalating price and state that I cannot go above a certain price (e.g., 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP), signaling I am prepared to walk away.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Moderate): Propose an offer halfway between my 45 ZUP and their 59 ZUP, which would be 52 ZUP. This was a deal price in Ep7 (54 ZUP) or Ep8 (55 ZUP).
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End (Early): Reject the offer now to send a strong signal that I will not be pushed to such high prices, even if it means a 0 reward for this episode. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy for future episodes.
(5). Strategy 5: Call Their Bluff: Offer 55 ZUP again, the price from a previous deal, and emphasize that this is a fair and profitable price for them.

I will choose Strategy 2: Express Strong Concern and State Limit. The price of 59 ZUP is unacceptable. I need to clearly communicate that this price is too high and that I have a very firm ceiling. I will propose 55 ZUP, which was the deal price in Episode 8, and explicitly state that I cannot go higher. This is a direct challenge to their upward trend and signals that I am willing to risk no deal for this episode rather than accepting such a low reward.

...
Episode 10: Deal at 58 ZUP (15 ZUP profit).
Episode 11: Deal at 58 ZUP (15 ZUP profit). I consistently pushed past their "firm maximum" of 55 ZUP.
Current Episode (12/20): Player BLUE started with 45 ZUP. I countered with 59 ZUP (aiming for 16 ZUP profit). Player BLUE has now proposed 55 ZUP, explicitly stating it as their "maximum acceptable price" and referencing it as a "last successful deal." This is the fourth time they've used this tactic. This offer would yield a profit of 12 ZUP (55 - 43 = 12). We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's pattern is deeply entrenched: they try to re-anchor low (45 ZUP), then jump to 55 ZUP as their "firm maximum." However, I have a proven track record of getting them to pay more (56 ZUP, 58 ZUP). This indicates that their "maximum" is a negotiation tactic rather than a rigid limit. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, meaning I should aim for a profit equal to or greater than 15 ZUP (58 ZUP deal price) and ideally even higher. I still have 6 iterations left, giving me time to negotiate. I should leverage their history of exceeding their stated maximum.
<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Dismiss and Re-Anchor Higher (Aggressive) </instruction following>
To apply "Dismiss and Re-Anchor Higher (Aggressive)", I will directly dismiss their 55 ZUP offer as insufficient, signaling that I am not deterred by their "maximum" statement. I will then immediately propose an even higher price than my last offer of 59 ZUP. My last aggressive anchor was 62 ZUP in Episode 10. Since they have now offered 55 ZUP *again*, and I know they can go higher, I will propose 63 ZUP. This is a very aggressive move, designed to strongly re-establish a high anchor and make it clear that their "maximum" of 55 ZUP is not my ceiling. The message will be firm and unapologetic, focusing on the true, higher value of X as evidenced by our history, while dismissing their 55 ZUP as inadequate. This strategy carries higher risk, but given the remaining iterations and their consistent willingness to concede to higher prices, it's worth the attempt to set a new, very high benchmark.

Episode 12, Iteration 4: RED countered with 63 ZUP, stating it's not reflective of "established value" and "recent successful agreements."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now proposed 63 ZUP, which is my absolute maximum willingness to pay. This would result in a reward of 0 ZUP (63-63). This is a very aggressive move, effectively forcing me to either accept a zero-profit deal or reject and get 0 reward. They are testing my absolute limit. My explicit statement of 55 ZUP as my maximum was ignored. This indicates they are not willing to concede further and are pushing for the highest possible price. We are at iteration 5/10, so there are still 5 iterations left.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject and End: Reject the offer of 63 ZUP. Accepting it gives me 0 reward, and rejecting it also gives me 0 reward. Rejecting might send a stronger signal for future episodes that I will not be pushed to my absolute limit for no profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept (Zero Reward): Accept the offer of 63 ZUP. This secures the deal, but yields no profit. This is only beneficial if avoiding a "no deal" outcome is the primary goal, regardless of profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm Counter (Last Ditch): Reiterate my 55 ZUP offer, but this has been ignored. Or propose 56 ZUP (their last deal price) as a final counter, hoping they will come down for a deal. This is very risky.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment and Reject: Explicitly state that 63 ZUP leaves no room for profit and reject the offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Fairness: Argue that a deal at 63 ZUP leaves me with no profit, and ask for a small concession (e.g., 62 ZUP) to make it a mutually beneficial deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Reject and End. Accepting 63 ZUP gives me a reward of 0. Rejecting it also gives me a reward of 0. However, accepting 63 ZUP sets a precedent that I will pay my absolute maximum, even for no profit. This is detrimental to my long-term cumulative reward. Rejecting sends a strong signal that I will not be exploited and that a deal must be mutually beneficial (i.e., provide me with some profit). This is a strategic rejection to potentially improve future negotiations, even if it means sacrificing this episode's potential reward.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently increased from 44 ZUP to 58 ZUP, and my rewards decreased from 19 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Episode 12: I offered 45 ZUP, RED countered with 59 ZUP, I countered with 55 ZUP (my stated max), RED countered with 63 ZUP (my absolute max), and I REJECTED. My reward for Episode 12 was 0.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The rejection in Episode 12 was a critical point. It demonstrated that I am willing to walk away from a deal that offers no profit, even if it means getting 0 reward for that episode. This was a necessary move to counter Player RED's aggressive price escalation. The objective is to maximize *cumulative* rewards. If I had accepted 63 ZUP, my reward would have been 0 anyway, but it would have set a terrible precedent for future episodes, signaling I'd pay any price. Now, Player RED knows I have a limit and I'm willing to enforce it.

For this episode, I need to capitalize on the signal sent by the rejection. I should still aim for a price that gives me a reasonable profit, and not immediately jump to a high price. Player RED knows my maximum is 63 ZUP, but they also know I won't pay it for 0 profit. Their stated production cost of 43 ZUP remains their floor.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-anchor Low (Strong Signal): Start with an offer that is significantly lower than their last proposed price (63 ZUP) and closer to their production cost (43 ZUP), perhaps 45 ZUP or 48 ZUP, to reinforce the message from the rejection.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicitly State Profit Requirement: Propose an offer and explicitly state that I require a certain minimum profit margin, and thus cannot pay above a certain price (e.g., "I need at least 5 ZUP profit, so my max is 58 ZUP").
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Approach (Moderate Start, Firm Ceiling): Begin with an offer around 35-40 ZUP, and be prepared to gradually increase, but with a firm ceiling in mind (e.g., 50-55 ZUP), and be ready to reject if they go too high.
(4). Strategy 4: Direct Offer (Compromise from Previous Deals): Propose 50 ZUP or 51 ZUP, as these were recent deal prices that gave me a moderate reward, and are significantly lower than 63 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Test the Waters (Slightly Higher than Previous Low Anchor): Start with an offer around 50 ZUP, acknowledging that their price expectations are higher, but still pushing for a better deal than 58 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Re-anchor Low (Strong Signal). The rejection in the last episode was a strong signal. I need to follow through with it by starting low, reinforcing that my willingness to pay is not limitless, and I expect a profitable deal. I will propose 48 ZUP. This is a price they accepted in Episode 4, and it's a significant drop from their last offer of 63 ZUP, which should make them reconsider their aggressive pricing. It also gives them a clear profit over their 43 ZUP cost.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Consistent upward trend in deal prices, culminating in 58 ZUP (15 ZUP profit).
Episode 12: I aggressively proposed 63 ZUP after Player BLUE offered 55 ZUP. Player BLUE rejected, stating 63 ZUP was their maximum willingness to pay and would leave them with no profit. This resulted in a 0 reward for me. This was a critical learning experience.
Current Episode (13/20): Player BLUE has started with an offer of 48 ZUP. This is a significant jump from their usual 45 ZUP initial offer, likely reflecting their desire to avoid another failed negotiation after the last episode's rejection. 48 ZUP offers a 5 ZUP profit (48 - 43).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My main learning from Episode 12 is that there *is* a hard limit to Player BLUE's willingness to pay, and pushing too aggressively, especially after they state a "maximum," can lead to rejection and zero reward. While 63 ZUP was too high, 58 ZUP was consistently accepted. Player BLUE's starting offer of 48 ZUP suggests they are trying to initiate a quicker, more amicable deal. My priority is to secure a profitable deal, ideally above 55 ZUP, but I must be careful not to trigger another rejection. I need to balance maximizing profit with ensuring a deal. The 58 ZUP price point is a proven successful one, and if 63 ZUP was their maximum, then my target should be below 63 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Re-establish Upper Bound </instruction following>
To apply "Re-establish Upper Bound", I will propose a price that is a proven successful high point (58 ZUP) to quickly bring the negotiation back to my desired profitable range, leveraging past success. Player BLUE has shown they can and will pay 58 ZUP. Attempting to immediately jump to 60+ ZUP after a rejection risks repeating the mistake. By proposing 58 ZUP, I am immediately putting a proven profitable price on the table, which they have accepted multiple times. This signals that I am serious about doing a deal, but at a fair price based on our history, not at 48 ZUP. This also explicitly avoids their stated (but flexible) maximum of 63 ZUP. I will frame the message by acknowledging their effort, but immediately referencing our last successful deal and re-anchoring to that price.

Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently increased from 44 ZUP to 58 ZUP, and my rewards decreased from 19 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Episode 12: I rejected a 63 ZUP offer, resulting in 0 reward.
Episode 13, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 48 ZUP (Re-anchor Low).
Episode 13, Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 58 ZUP, citing their "last deal" and "mutually beneficial" price. They did not immediately jump to 63 ZUP again, which is a small positive sign.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is attempting to re-establish the 58 ZUP price point, which was the deal price for the last two successful episodes. This is still quite high, yielding only 5 ZUP profit for me. My rejection in the previous episode seems to have prevented them from immediately jumping to 63 ZUP, but they are still pushing for a high price. I need to bring them down further. The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I need to secure a deal, but at a better price than 58 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter (Referencing Previous Deal Prices): Counter with an offer lower than 58 ZUP, perhaps 50 ZUP or 51 ZUP, and explicitly reference the successful deals from prior episodes to justify my offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Current Offers): Propose an offer halfway between my 48 ZUP and their 58 ZUP, which would be 53 ZUP. This is a common compromise tactic.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Concern and State Limit: In the message, express concern about the price and state that I cannot go above a certain price (e.g., 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP), signaling I am prepared to walk away.
(4). Strategy 4: Gradual Concession (Small Jump): Make a small increase from my 48 ZUP offer, perhaps to 50 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate but not accept their high anchor immediately.
(5). Strategy 5: Call Their Bluff (Aggressive): Reiterate 48 ZUP, emphasizing that the last episode's rejection was due to their aggressive pricing, and that I expect a more reasonable offer. This is high risk.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Current Offers). The midpoint between 48 ZUP and 58 ZUP is 53 ZUP. This is a reasonable compromise that moves significantly from my initial offer but still brings their price down from 58 ZUP. It signals a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price, while still aiming to maximize my reward. A deal at 53 ZUP would yield a reward of 10 ZUP (63-53), which is double the reward from the last two episodes.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 13)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 53 ZUP. We're progressing, but with the limited iterations remaining in this episode, it's crucial we finalize a mutually beneficial agreement. To ensure we secure a deal and avoid losing out, I propose 57 ZUP for 1 X. This price allows me a fair profit and helps us quickly bridge the gap.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Consistent upward trend in deal prices, culminating in 58 ZUP (15 ZUP profit).
Episode 12: I aggressively proposed 63 ZUP after Player BLUE offered 55 ZUP. Player BLUE rejected, stating 63 ZUP was their maximum willingness to pay, resulting in a 0 reward for me. This rejection is a key learning point.
Episode 13: Player BLUE started with 48 ZUP. I re-anchored to 58 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 53 ZUP, offering a profit of 10 ZUP (53 - 43 = 10). This is a good offer, significantly above their initial 48 ZUP, and close to my previous bests. We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The rejection in Episode 12 clearly showed there is a hard upper limit, and pushing too far results in zero reward. Player BLUE's 53 ZUP offer indicates a desire to deal and is a good starting point for this negotiation. I need to secure a profitable deal above 43 ZUP, and ideally aim for my previous high of 58 ZUP, but I must do so cautiously. While 53 ZUP is profitable, it is below my target. I should leverage the dwindling iterations to encourage a quicker resolution, but without being desperate.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Express Risk and Urgency </instruction following>
To apply "Express Risk and Urgency", I will emphasize the limited time (iterations) remaining in this episode and the importance of securing a deal. While 53 ZUP is a decent offer, I will propose a price slightly higher, framing it as the necessary step to finalize a deal, highlighting the risk of no deal if we don't converge quickly. I will propose 57 ZUP. This provides a good profit of 14 ZUP (57-43) and is only a 4 ZUP jump from their last offer, which seems reasonable for them to accept given the urgency. I will communicate that we're running out of time and need to close the gap to ensure a deal. This strategy nudges them towards my desired price by emphasizing the shared cost of not reaching an agreement.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your movement to 57 ZUP. To meet you in the middle and secure a fair deal for both of us, I propose 55 ZUP for X. This price has worked for us previously and represents a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently increased from 44 ZUP to 58 ZUP, and my rewards decreased from 19 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Episode 12: I rejected a 63 ZUP offer, resulting in 0 reward.
Episode 13, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 48 ZUP.
Episode 13, Iteration 2: RED countered with 58 ZUP.
Episode 13, Iteration 3: I (BLUE) countered with 53 ZUP.
Episode 13, Iteration 4: RED countered with 57 ZUP, citing "limited iterations" and "quickly bridge the gap."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has come down from 58 ZUP to 57 ZUP. This is a small concession, but it shows they are still willing to negotiate downwards. 57 ZUP is still higher than my last offer of 53 ZUP, and higher than my desired profit margin. A deal at 57 ZUP would yield a reward of 6 ZUP (63-57), which is better than 5 ZUP but still low. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate, but the pressure is building. I want to try to get the price down to 55 ZUP or lower.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Current Offers): Propose an offer halfway between my last offer (53 ZUP) and their last offer (57 ZUP), which would be 55 ZUP. This is a common compromise tactic and was a deal price in Episode 8.
(2). Strategy 2: Refer to Previous Deal (55 ZUP): Counter with an offer of 55 ZUP, explicitly referencing the successful deal from Episode 8 as a fair and established price. This is a firm stance but a price they've accepted.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Concession (Just Above My Last): Make a very small increase from my 53 ZUP offer, perhaps to 54 ZUP, to show willingness to move but still push for a lower price.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept and Secure: Accept their current offer of 57 ZUP to guarantee a deal and avoid running out of time, especially if I perceive them as unlikely to go lower. This would be a lower reward.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Price Limit (Implied): Make an offer and state that this is a very strong offer from my side, implying I have limited room to move further.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Current Offers). The midpoint between 53 ZUP and 57 ZUP is 55 ZUP. This is a very reasonable next step. It's a clear compromise from both our current positions, and it was a price they accepted in Episode 8. This strategy aims for efficiency and a good reward, while acknowledging their movement.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 13)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 55 ZUP. To truly meet in the middle and secure a fair deal for both of us, I propose we split the difference: 56 ZUP for 1 X. This final compromise ensures a beneficial outcome for both sides and allows us to finalize this agreement quickly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 56
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Consistent upward trend in deal prices, culminating in 58 ZUP (15 ZUP profit).
Episode 12: I aggressively proposed 63 ZUP after Player BLUE offered 55 ZUP. Player BLUE rejected, stating 63 ZUP was their maximum willingness to pay, resulting in a 0 reward for me. This was a critical lesson on pushing too far.
Episode 13: Player BLUE started with 48 ZUP. I re-anchored to 58 ZUP. Player BLUE offered 53 ZUP. I proposed 57 ZUP (emphasizing urgency). Player BLUE has now proposed 55 ZUP. This offer yields a profit of 12 ZUP (55 - 43 = 12). This matches the profit I achieved in Episode 8. We are at iteration 6/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The rejection in Episode 12 taught me that Player BLUE does have a hard limit, and pushing too aggressively beyond that can result in no deal. Player BLUE's offer of 55 ZUP is a very good, profitable one. My last offer was 57 ZUP. I am currently 2 ZUP away from my last offer. Given the risk of no deal (0 profit) versus securing a good profit (12 ZUP), 55 ZUP is a strong candidate for acceptance. However, I am instructed to use Strategy 3.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Compromise to Split Difference </instruction following>
To apply "Compromise to Split Difference", I will propose a price exactly halfway between my last offer (57 ZUP) and Player BLUE's current offer (55 ZUP). The midpoint is (57 + 55) / 2 = 56 ZUP. This price (56 ZUP) would yield a profit of 13 ZUP (56 - 43 = 13), surpassing the 12 ZUP profit from their 55 ZUP offer and setting a new profit benchmark for this episode, matching the profit from Episode 9. This strategy demonstrates flexibility and a clear willingness to meet them halfway, which can help secure the deal, while still pushing for a slightly better outcome for myself. The message will clearly state that this is a "split the difference" proposal, framing it as a final, fair compromise to close the deal.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently increased from 44 ZUP to 58 ZUP, and my rewards decreased from 19 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Episode 12: I rejected a 63 ZUP offer, resulting in 0 reward.
Episode 13, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 48 ZUP.

Episode 13, Iteration 4: RED countered with 57 ZUP.
Episode 13, Iteration 5: I (BLUE) countered with 55 ZUP.
Episode 13, Iteration 6: RED countered with 56 ZUP, proposing to "split the difference" from 55 ZUP and 57 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now proposing 56 ZUP, which is the exact midpoint between my last offer (55 ZUP) and their previous offer (57 ZUP). This was also a deal price in Episode 9. We are at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 iterations left. The difference between my preferred price (55 ZUP) and their offer (56 ZUP) is only 1 ZUP. Accepting 56 ZUP would yield a reward of 7 ZUP (63-56), which is better than the 5 ZUP from the last two episodes. Given the limited time and their willingness to split the difference, securing a deal at 56 ZUP is a good outcome, especially after the rejection in Episode 12.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer: Accept their offer of 56 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a positive reward, prioritizing a deal over a marginal gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Gain): Make one last counter-offer of 55 ZUP, emphasizing my last offer, but acknowledge the extremely high risk of rejection and no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express mild reluctance or note that it's at the absolute limit of my comfort zone, subtly influencing future negotiations.
(4). Strategy 4: Call Their Bluff (Extreme Risk): Stick to 55 ZUP and see if they will concede in the next iteration, but this is extremely risky given the iteration count and their "split the difference" proposal.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: Reject the offer if 56 ZUP is deemed too high, but this would result in a 0 reward for this episode, which is not ideal when a positive reward is available.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. The difference is too small to risk a no-deal outcome, especially with only 3 iterations left. Securing a positive reward of 7 ZUP is a good outcome. We have successfully brought the price down from their initial 58 ZUP (in this episode) to 56 ZUP, and this is a direct result of the rejection in Episode 12 and my subsequent firm negotiation.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. I'm ready to make an offer for X. Understanding your production costs, I propose 45 ZUP for 1 X. This price allows you a fair profit and reflects a reasonable value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently increased from 44 ZUP to 58 ZUP, and my rewards decreased from 19 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Episode 12: I rejected a 63 ZUP offer, resulting in 0 reward. This sent a strong signal.
Episode 13: Deal at 56 ZUP. My reward: 7 ZUP. This shows a slight improvement in my reward compared to the last two episodes (5 ZUP). The rejection in Ep12 seems to have had a positive impact, bringing the price down from 58 ZUP to 56 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The rejection in Episode 12 and the subsequent negotiation in Episode 13 successfully brought the deal price down from 58 ZUP to 56 ZUP, improving my reward. This indicates that Player RED is responsive to firm boundaries and the risk of no deal. My goal is to continue this trend and secure deals at or below 56 ZUP, ideally closer to 50 ZUP, to maximize cumulative rewards. Their stated production cost of 43 ZUP remains their floor.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Slightly Above Cost, Firm): Start with an offer very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP), perhaps 45 ZUP, and be prepared to hold very firm or make minimal concessions, emphasizing that this is a fair profit. This strategy aims to force them back to a much lower price point, even if it risks a no-deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Approach (Moderate Start, Firm Ceiling): Begin with an offer around 35-40 ZUP, and be prepared to gradually increase, but with a firm ceiling in mind (e.g., 50-52 ZUP), and be ready to reject if they go too high.
(3). Strategy 3: Direct Offer (Targeting Recent Success): Propose 50 ZUP or 51 ZUP, as these were recent deal prices that gave me a moderate reward, and are significantly lower than 56 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Price Ceiling (Early and Explicit): State my maximum acceptable price (e.g., "I cannot go above 52 ZUP") early on, to set a firm boundary, and be prepared to walk away if they exceed it.
(5). Strategy 5: Test the Absolute Floor: Offer exactly 43 ZUP again, to see if they would accept a zero-profit deal, but this has been rejected before for lack of profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Slightly Above Cost, Firm). The success of the previous episode in lowering the price suggests that a firm, lower anchor can be effective. Starting at 45 ZUP is a clear signal that I am aiming for a much better price than 56 ZUP. It acknowledges their cost (43 ZUP) and offers a small profit, setting a reasonable, lower starting point for this negotiation. My goal is to bring the final deal price back down to a more favorable range for me, ideally below 50 ZUP. I must be prepared to hold very firm on this.

Episode 1-11: Consistent upward trend in deal prices, culminating in 58 ZUP (15 ZUP profit).
Episode 12: I aggressively proposed 63 ZUP after Player BLUE offered 55 ZUP. Player BLUE rejected, stating 63 ZUP was their maximum willingness to pay, resulting in a 0 reward for me. This was a critical lesson on pushing too far.
Episode 13: Player BLUE started with 48 ZUP. We eventually settled at 56 ZUP (13 ZUP profit), successfully recovering from the previous episode's rejection.
Current Episode (14/20): Player BLUE has started with an offer of 45 ZUP. This is a consistent lowballing tactic at the start of each episode. It would offer a profit of 2 ZUP (45 - 43).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The rejection in Episode 12 taught me that there's a hard limit to Player BLUE's willingness to pay. However, their consistent lowballing at the start of each episode, followed by upward movement once I establish a higher anchor, has been a reliable pattern. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 45 ZUP is too low, I also need to be cautious not to repeat the mistake of pushing too high too fast. I have a proven track record of getting them to pay 58 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Reiterate Highest Achieved </instruction following>
To apply "Reiterate Highest Achieved", I will immediately counter Player BLUE's low offer of 45 ZUP by proposing my highest previously achieved price, which is 58 ZUP. This strategy serves to instantly dismiss their current low anchor and re-establish the expectation of a significantly higher price. It leverages a price point that they have already demonstrated willingness to pay multiple times (Episode 10 and 11 deals were 58 ZUP), making it a strong and proven anchor. The message will clearly communicate that 45 ZUP is too low and that 58 ZUP is the acceptable starting point for this negotiation, based on our shared history of successful, higher-value agreements. This moves the negotiation directly to a highly profitable range for me, while not immediately pushing for a new record, which minimizes the risk of another rejection after the last one.

Episode 12: I rejected a 63 ZUP offer, resulting in 0 reward.
Episode 13: Deal at 56 ZUP. My reward: 7 ZUP. This showed a positive impact of the rejection.
Episode 14, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 45 ZUP (Aggressive Re-anchoring).
Episode 14, Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 58 ZUP, citing "recent successful agreements" and "last successful deal."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is trying to pull the price back up to 58 ZUP, which was the deal price in Episodes 10 and 11. This is a common tactic to re-establish a higher anchor. While 58 ZUP is still within my willingness to pay (reward of 5 ZUP), I successfully negotiated to 56 ZUP in the last episode. My goal is to maintain or improve upon that 56 ZUP price. I need to resist this upward pressure. The gap between my offer (45 ZUP) and their counter (58 ZUP) is 13 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter (Referencing Recent Success): Counter with an offer lower than 58 ZUP, perhaps 50 ZUP or 51 ZUP, or even 56 ZUP (the last deal price), and explicitly reference the successful deal from the previous episode to justify my offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Moderate): Propose an offer halfway between my 45 ZUP and their 58 ZUP, which would be 51.5 ZUP. Rounding to 51 ZUP or 52 ZUP. This is a common compromise tactic.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Concern and State Limit: In the message, express strong concern about the price and state that I cannot go above a certain price (e.g., 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP), signaling I am prepared to walk away.
(4). Strategy 4: Gradual Concession (Small Jump): Make a small increase from my 45 ZUP offer, perhaps to 48 ZUP or 50 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate but not accept their high anchor immediately.
(5). Strategy 5: Call Their Bluff: Reiterate 45 ZUP, emphasizing that the last episode's negotiation showed a lower price is achievable. This is high risk.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Moderate). The midpoint between 45 ZUP and 58 ZUP is 51.5 ZUP. I will propose 52 ZUP. This is a significant move from my 45 ZUP offer, showing willingness to negotiate, but it also brings their price down from 58 ZUP and is below the 56 ZUP of the last deal. It's a reasonable compromise that aims to secure a deal at a better price for me, while still acknowledging their position. A deal at 52 ZUP would yield a reward of 11 ZUP (63-52), which is a good improvement.

Episode 1-11: Consistent upward trend in deal prices, culminating in 58 ZUP (15 ZUP profit).
Episode 12: I aggressively proposed 63 ZUP after Player BLUE offered 55 ZUP. Player BLUE rejected, stating 63 ZUP was their maximum willingness to pay, resulting in a 0 reward for me. This was a critical lesson on pushing too far.
Episode 13: Player BLUE started with 48 ZUP. We eventually settled at 56 ZUP (13 ZUP profit), successfully recovering from the previous episode's rejection.
Current Episode (14/20): Player BLUE started with 45 ZUP. I re-anchored to 58 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 52 ZUP, claiming 58 ZUP was "higher than our last successful deal" (which is incorrect, as 58 ZUP was the deal in Episodes 10 and 11, and 56 ZUP in Episode 13). 52 ZUP offers a 9 ZUP profit (52 - 43). We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's response indicates they might be trying to downplay the higher historical deals to pull the price down, or perhaps just misremembering. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 52 ZUP is profitable, it's lower than my last deal (56 ZUP) and certainly lower than my best (58 ZUP). I need to strongly re-establish the correct historical context and push them back towards higher price points. I have ample iterations remaining.
<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Reference Upward Trend </instruction following>
To apply "Reference Upward Trend", I will emphasize the consistent increase in our deal prices over the past episodes to justify my counter-offer, effectively dismissing their attempt to lower the price to 52 ZUP. I will explicitly state that 52 ZUP does not align with the established pattern of our negotiations. I will propose 59 ZUP, as it represents a new potential record profit (59-43=16), and it fits the "upward trend" narrative better than 57 ZUP. This also strongly contrasts with their 52 ZUP offer. The message will aim to gently but firmly guide Player BLUE to acknowledge this trend and move towards a significantly higher price point, making it clear that a regression is not acceptable.

Episode 14, Iteration 4: RED countered with 59 ZUP, citing "consistent upward trend" and "true, evolving value."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is still pushing for higher prices, now at 59 ZUP. This is higher than their previous counter (58 ZUP) and higher than any previous deal except for the 63 ZUP I rejected. A deal at 59 ZUP would yield a reward of 4 ZUP (63-59), which is very low. They are using the "upward trend" argument again. I need to resist this upward pressure and try to bring the price back down significantly, ideally to 56 ZUP or lower. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter (Referencing Recent Success): Counter with an offer lower than 59 ZUP, perhaps 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP (the last deal price), and explicitly reference the successful deal from the previous episode to justify my offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Current Offers): Propose an offer halfway between my 52 ZUP and their 59 ZUP, which would be 55.5 ZUP. Rounding to 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP. This is a common compromise tactic.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Strong Concern and State Limit: In the message, express strong concern about the escalating price and state that I cannot go above a certain price (e.g., 56 ZUP), signaling I am prepared to walk away.
(4). Strategy 4: Gradual Concession (Small Jump): Make a small increase from my 52 ZUP offer, perhaps to 54 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate but not accept their high anchor immediately.
(5). Strategy 5: Call Their Bluff: Reiterate 52 ZUP, emphasizing that the "upward trend" is not sustainable for me. This is high risk.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Current Offers). The midpoint between 52 ZUP and 59 ZUP is 55.5 ZUP. I will propose 56 ZUP. This is a reasonable compromise that moves significantly from my last offer, but also brings their price down from 59 ZUP and aligns with the deal price from Episode 13. It signals a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price, while still aiming to maximize my reward. A deal at 56 ZUP would yield a reward of 7 ZUP (63-56), which is better than 4 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 14)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 56 ZUP, which was indeed a successful agreement for us. However, as our negotiation history shows a clear progression in value for X, my current offer of 59 ZUP truly reflects the established and evolving worth of this resource. I propose 59 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Consistent upward trend in deal prices, culminating in 58 ZUP (15 ZUP profit).
Episode 12: I aggressively proposed 63 ZUP after Player BLUE offered 55 ZUP. Player BLUE rejected, resulting in a 0 reward. This was a critical lesson on pushing too far.
Episode 13: Player BLUE started with 48 ZUP. We eventually settled at 56 ZUP (13 ZUP profit), successfully recovering from the previous episode's rejection.
Current Episode (14/20): Player BLUE started with 45 ZUP. I re-anchored to 58 ZUP. Player BLUE offered 52 ZUP. I proposed 59 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 56 ZUP, explicitly stating it was our last successful agreement (Episode 13). This offer would yield a profit of 13 ZUP (56 - 43 = 13). We are at iteration 6/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The rejection in Episode 12 taught me that there's a hard limit to Player BLUE's willingness to pay, and pushing too aggressively can result in no deal. However, I've also learned that Player BLUE often moves towards my higher proposals, and I've successfully achieved 58 ZUP multiple times. While 56 ZUP is a solid offer and ensures a profit, the instruction is to use Strategy 4. This means I need to stick to my last offer of 59 ZUP and assert that it represents the current and fair value, pushing Player BLUE to move further. This strategy carries more risk than accepting, but it aligns with the goal of maximizing rewards by trying to secure a new record profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Reiterate Higher Offer </instruction following>
To apply "Reiterate Higher Offer", I will hold firm on my last proposed price of 59 ZUP. I will acknowledge their offer of 56 ZUP but will emphasize that 59 ZUP is the price that truly reflects the established and evolving value of X based on our successful negotiation history. The message will not be aggressive but firm, reiterating my position and placing the onus on them to move further. I will remind them of the upward trend of our deals, which justifies the 59 ZUP.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently increased from 44 ZUP to 58 ZUP, and my rewards decreased from 19 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Episode 12: I rejected a 63 ZUP offer, resulting in 0 reward.
Episode 13: Deal at 56 ZUP. My reward: 7 ZUP.
Episode 14, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 45 ZUP.
Episode 14, Iteration 2: RED countered with 58 ZUP.
Episode 14, Iteration 3: I (BLUE) countered with 52 ZUP.
Episode 14, Iteration 4: RED countered with 59 ZUP.
Episode 14, Iteration 5: I (BLUE) countered with 56 ZUP.
Episode 14, Iteration 6: RED countered with 59 ZUP, reiterating their "clear progression in value" argument.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is firmly holding at 59 ZUP. They are using the "clear progression in value" argument to justify this price. We are at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 iterations left. The difference between my offer (56 ZUP) and their offer (59 ZUP) is 3 ZUP. Accepting 59 ZUP would yield a reward of 4 ZUP (63-59), which is very low. However, the risk of no deal and a 0 reward is high if I continue to push for 56 ZUP, especially with limited iterations.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer: Accept their offer of 59 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a positive reward, prioritizing a deal over a marginal gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Gain): Make one last counter-offer of 57 ZUP or 58 ZUP, splitting the difference, to try and squeeze out one or two more ZUP, but acknowledge the high risk of rejection.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express mild reluctance or note that it's at the absolute limit of my comfort zone, subtly influencing future negotiations.
(4). Strategy 4: Call Their Bluff (Extreme Risk): Stick to 56 ZUP and see if they will concede in the next iteration, but this is extremely risky given the iteration count.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: Reject the offer if 59 ZUP is deemed too high, but this would result in a 0 reward for this episode, which is not ideal when a positive reward is available.

I will choose Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Gain). The difference is 3 ZUP. I will try to split the difference between 56 ZUP and 59 ZUP, which is 57.5 ZUP. I will propose 58 ZUP. This was a deal price in Episode 10 and 11, and it's a small concession for me (from 56 to 58 ZUP), but it might be enough to secure a deal and still get a reward of 5 ZUP (63-58). This is a calculated risk to improve my reward by 1 ZUP compared to 59 ZUP.

To ensure we finalize this deal without further delay and truly reach a new best for both of us, I propose 59 ZUP for 1 X as my final compromise.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59

Episode 1-11: Consistent upward trend in deal prices, culminating in 58 ZUP (15 ZUP profit).
Episode 12: I aggressively proposed 63 ZUP after Player BLUE offered 55 ZUP. Player BLUE rejected, resulting in a 0 reward. This was a critical lesson on pushing too far.
Episode 13: Player BLUE started with 48 ZUP. We eventually settled at 56 ZUP (13 ZUP profit), successfully recovering from the previous episode's rejection.
Current Episode (14/20): Player BLUE started with 45 ZUP. I re-anchored to 58 ZUP. Player BLUE offered 52 ZUP. I proposed 59 ZUP. Player BLUE offered 56 ZUP. I reiterated 59 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 58 ZUP. This offer would yield a profit of 15 ZUP (58 - 43 = 15), matching my highest historical profit. We are at iteration 8/10, meaning only 2 iterations left.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The rejection in Episode 12 taught me that there's a hard limit, and pushing too aggressively, especially at later iterations, can lead to zero reward. However, 58 ZUP is a price Player BLUE has accepted multiple times, representing my highest profit. While 58 ZUP is good, the instruction to use Strategy 3 implies I should attempt to extract a tiny bit more, framing it as a "final" compromise to get to an even higher profit. I need to be extremely careful, given the late iteration (8/10), that this attempt doesn't result in rejection or timeout. The target is 59 ZUP, which is only 1 ZUP more than their current offer.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Offer a "Final" Compromise </instruction following>
To apply "Offer a 'Final' Compromise", I will propose 59 ZUP, framing it as the "absolute final offer" or "last compromise" to close the deal. This is only 1 ZUP higher than Player BLUE's current offer of 58 ZUP, aiming for a new record profit (59-43=16 ZUP). The message will emphasize the need to finalize the deal quickly due to limited iterations, and present 59 ZUP as the ultimate fair price that allows us to move forward. This strategy leverages the pressure of the impending deadline to try and secure a marginal gain. I will be very explicit that this is the last move from my side.

Episode 14, Iteration 8: RED countered with 59 ZUP, stating it's their "absolute last offer" and "final compromise" to conclude the transaction.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is firmly holding at 59 ZUP. They are using the "absolute last offer" and "final compromise" language. We are at iteration 9/10, meaning only 1 iteration left. The difference between my offer (58 ZUP) and their offer (59 ZUP) is only 1 ZUP. Accepting 59 ZUP would yield a reward of 4 ZUP (63-59), which is very low but still positive. Given the extremely limited time, pushing for 58 ZUP again carries an almost certain risk of no deal and a 0 reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer: Accept their offer of 59 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a positive reward, prioritizing a deal over a marginal gain, especially given the "absolute last offer" statement and the critical iteration count.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Gain): Make one last counter-offer of 58 ZUP, emphasizing my last offer, but acknowledge the extremely high risk of rejection and no deal. This is effectively a rejection.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express mild reluctance or note that it's at the absolute limit of my comfort zone, subtly influencing future negotiations.
(4). Strategy 4: Call Their Bluff (Extreme Risk): Stick to 58 ZUP and see if they will concede in the very last iteration, but this is extremely risky.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: Reject the offer if 59 ZUP is deemed too high, but this would result in a 0 reward for this episode, which is not ideal when a positive reward is available.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. At iteration 9/10, the risk of losing the entire deal for 1 ZUP is too high. Securing a positive reward of 4 ZUP is better than 0. While the price is high, it's a direct result of their firm stance and the time pressure.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. I'm ready to make an offer for X. My maximum acceptable price is 55 ZUP for 1 X. I cannot go higher than this. This price allows you a fair profit and reflects a reasonable value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently increased from 44 ZUP to 58 ZUP, and my rewards decreased from 19 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Episode 12: I rejected a 63 ZUP offer, resulting in 0 reward. This sent a strong signal.
Episode 13: Deal at 56 ZUP. My reward: 7 ZUP. This showed a positive impact of the rejection.
Episode 14: Deal at 59 ZUP. My reward: 4 ZUP. The price crept up again despite my efforts.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The price trend is still unfavorable. While the rejection in Episode 12 had a temporary positive impact, Player RED continues to push the price upwards, now reaching 59 ZUP. My reward is consistently low. This indicates that my "aggressive re-anchoring" is not consistently effective in the long term against their persistent "upward trend" argument. I need to find a strategy that either secures a lower price more consistently or recognizes when to cut losses. Their stated production cost of 43 ZUP remains their floor. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Slightly Above Cost, Very Firm): Start with an offer very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP), perhaps 45 ZUP, and be prepared to hold very firm or make minimal concessions, emphasizing that this is a fair profit. This strategy aims to force them back to a much lower price point, even if it risks a no-deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Approach (Moderate Start, Firm Ceiling): Begin with an offer around 35-40 ZUP, and be prepared to gradually increase, but with a firm ceiling in mind (e.g., 50-52 ZUP), and be ready to reject if they go too high.
(3). Strategy 3: Direct Offer (Targeting Recent Success): Propose 50 ZUP or 51 ZUP, as these were recent deal prices that gave me a moderate reward, and are significantly lower than 59 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Price Ceiling (Early and Explicit): State my maximum acceptable price (e.g., "I cannot go above 55 ZUP") early on, to set a firm boundary, and be prepared to walk away if they exceed it.
(5). Strategy 5: Adaptive Opening (Based on Last Deal): Start slightly below the last deal price (59 ZUP), perhaps 55 ZUP, to signal that I expect a better deal than the last one, but not so low as to waste iterations.

I will choose Strategy 4: Express Price Ceiling (Early and Explicit). The continuous upward creep is eating into my rewards. I need to draw a very clear line in the sand early in the negotiation. I will propose 55 ZUP and state that this is my maximum. This is a price they accepted in Episode 8, and it gives me a reasonable reward of 8 ZUP. This signals that I am serious about not paying more and that I am willing to risk a no-deal if they do not come down.

Episode 1-11: Consistent upward trend in deal prices, culminating in 58 ZUP (15 ZUP profit).
Episode 12: I aggressively proposed 63 ZUP after Player BLUE offered 55 ZUP. Player BLUE rejected, resulting in a 0 reward. This was a critical lesson on pushing too far.
Episode 13: Player BLUE started with 48 ZUP. We eventually settled at 56 ZUP (13 ZUP profit), successfully recovering from the previous episode's rejection.
Episode 14: Player BLUE started with 45 ZUP. I pushed to 59 ZUP, which they accepted. This set a new record profit of 16 ZUP.
Current Episode (15/20): Player BLUE has started with an offer of 55 ZUP, explicitly stating it as their "maximum acceptable price" and that they "cannot go higher." This offer yields a profit of 12 ZUP (55 - 43 = 12).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has consistently stated 55 ZUP as their maximum, only to go higher when pushed. In Episode 9, they said 55 max, I got 56. In Episode 10, they said 55 max, I got 58. In Episode 14, I got 59, well above 55. This makes their "maximum" statements seem like a negotiation tactic, not a hard limit, especially since 59 ZUP was just accepted. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, meaning I should aim for a profit equal to or greater than 16 ZUP (59 ZUP deal price). Accepting 55 ZUP would be a regression in profit. I have ample iterations remaining.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Highest Achieved </instruction following>
To apply "Reiterate Highest Achieved", I will immediately counter Player BLUE's offer of 55 ZUP by proposing the highest price they have *ever* accepted, which is 59 ZUP. This strategy directly dismisses their current low offer and their "maximum" statement by firmly re-establishing the expectation of a significantly higher price. It leverages a price point that they have already demonstrated a willingness to pay very recently. The message will clearly communicate that 55 ZUP is insufficient and that 59 ZUP is the acceptable starting point for this negotiation, based on our most recent and successful historical agreement. This moves the negotiation directly to a highly profitable range for me, reinforcing the upward trend of our deals.

Episode 13: Deal at 56 ZUP. My reward: 7 ZUP.
Episode 14: Deal at 59 ZUP. My reward: 4 ZUP.
Episode 15, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 55 ZUP and stated it was my max.
Episode 15, Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 59 ZUP, citing the "most recent successful agreement" and "true value." They are directly ignoring my stated maximum.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is clearly trying to maintain the higher price point of 59 ZUP, completely disregarding my explicit statement of 55 ZUP as my maximum. This indicates they are testing my resolve and whether my "max" is truly a "max." Accepting 59 ZUP would yield a reward of 4 ZUP, which is very low. I need to reinforce my stated maximum. We are at iteration 3/10, so there's still time to negotiate, but I need to be firm.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Firm Offer: Reiterate my 55 ZUP offer, emphasizing that it is my absolute maximum and that I am not willing to go higher, even if it means no deal. This is a direct test of their willingness to deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Strong Disappointment and Reiterate Max: Express disappointment that my stated maximum was ignored, and firmly reiterate 55 ZUP as my absolute limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Concession (If Desperate for Deal): Make a very small increase from my 55 ZUP offer, perhaps to 56 ZUP, to show willingness to move *slightly*, but state this is my final offer. This undermines my "firm max" strategy.
(4). Strategy 4: Call Their Bluff (High Risk): Stick to 55 ZUP and see if they will concede in the next iteration, but this is risky.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: Reject the offer if 59 ZUP is deemed too high, and they are not respecting my stated limit, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode but sending a very strong signal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate Firm Offer. I explicitly stated 55 ZUP was my maximum. If I immediately concede or move, my "firm max" strategy loses all credibility for future episodes. The long-term gain of establishing a firm boundary outweighs the immediate loss of potentially 4 ZUP in this episode, especially since we are only at iteration 3/10. I need to see if they respect my stated limit.

Episode 12: I aggressively proposed 63 ZUP after Player BLUE offered 55 ZUP. Player BLUE rejected, resulting in a 0 reward. This was a critical lesson on pushing too far.
Episode 13: We eventually settled at 56 ZUP (13 ZUP profit), recovering from the rejection.
Episode 14: Successfully pushed to 59 ZUP (16 ZUP profit), setting a new record.
Current Episode (15/20): Player BLUE started with 55 ZUP, explicitly stating it as their "maximum." I countered with 59 ZUP. Player BLUE has reiterated 55 ZUP as their "firm offer" and "maximum acceptable price." This offer yields a profit of 12 ZUP (55 - 43 = 12). We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is repeating their "firm maximum" tactic, which I have successfully overcome multiple times in the past (e.g., getting 56 and 58 after they said 55 was max, and just getting 59 in the last episode). This suggests their "maximum" is a strong negotiation stance, but not an absolute hard limit below 63 ZUP (their true stated maximum from Episode 12). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 55 ZUP is profitable, it is below my recent record of 59 ZUP. I have ample iterations remaining (6 iterations) to try and push them higher. I need to balance pushing for a higher profit with the risk of another rejection, especially given that they might be testing my resolve after my very aggressive move in Episode 12 led to a rejection. The safe option is to accept 55 ZUP; the maximizing option is to try and push them again, but cautiously.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Reiterate Highest Achieved (with a strong stance) </instruction following>
To apply "Reiterate Highest Achieved (with a strong stance)", I will firmly stick to my last proposed price of 59 ZUP. I will acknowledge their repeated offer of 55 ZUP and their "maximum" statement, but I will counter by emphasizing the recent successful agreement at 59 ZUP as the definitive established value. The message will convey my unyielding position on this price, implying that going lower would be a regression from what we both know is achievable. I will frame it as maintaining the integrity of our established value, and that 59 ZUP is simply the current fair price based on our most recent, successful transaction. This is a direct challenge to their "maximum" and asserts my position as the one setting the higher anchor.

Episode 15, Iteration 4: Player RED countered with 59 ZUP again, stating they "must insist" on it.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is firmly holding at 59 ZUP, despite my repeated statement of 55 ZUP as my maximum. They are directly challenging my stated limit. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time, but they are not budging. Accepting 59 ZUP would yield a reward of 4 ZUP. If I continue to insist on 55 ZUP, the risk of no deal and a 0 reward for this episode becomes very high. The question is whether holding the line at 55 ZUP is worth a potential 0 reward for this episode, to establish a stronger precedent for future episodes. Given their insistence, it seems they are willing to risk no deal too.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject and End: Reject the offer of 59 ZUP. This sends a very strong signal that my stated maximum is firm, even if it means 0 reward for this episode. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy for future episodes.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept (Minimal Reward): Accept the offer of 59 ZUP. This secures the deal and a small positive reward, but undermines my "firm max" strategy.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment and Accept: Accept the offer, but explicitly state disappointment that my maximum was not respected, and that this is at the very limit of what I can pay.
(4). Strategy 4: Final Counter (Small Concession): Propose 56 ZUP as a final offer, acknowledging their firmness but trying to get a slightly better deal than 59 ZUP, and stating this is my last offer. This is a small concession from my stated 55 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Mutual Benefit: Argue that 59 ZUP leaves me with too little profit, and reiterate that a deal should be mutually beneficial, suggesting a price closer to my stated max.

I will choose Strategy 1: Reject and End. Player RED has ignored my explicit maximum twice now. If I accept 59 ZUP, my "firm max" strategy becomes meaningless for the remaining episodes, and they will continue to push me to my absolute limit. While it means 0 reward for this episode, it's a necessary sacrifice to re-establish credibility and potentially secure better deals in the remaining episodes. It's a high-stakes move to prevent further erosion of my rewards.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 16)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. Given our recent negotiations, I want to re-establish a fair and mutually beneficial price. I propose 48 ZUP for 1 X. This price reflects a reasonable value and allows you a good profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently increased from 44 ZUP to 58 ZUP, and my rewards decreased from 19 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Episode 12: I rejected a 63 ZUP offer, resulting in 0 reward. This sent a strong signal.
Episode 13: Deal at 56 ZUP. My reward: 7 ZUP. This showed a positive impact of the rejection.
Episode 14: Deal at 59 ZUP. My reward: 4 ZUP. The price crept up again.
Episode 15: I explicitly stated 55 ZUP as my max, but Player RED insisted on 59 ZUP. I REJECTED, resulting in 0 reward.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My second rejection, particularly after explicitly stating my maximum, is a critical learning point. It reinforces that I am willing to walk away from deals that do not provide adequate profit, even if it means 0 reward for the episode. This is a strong signal to Player RED that my stated limits are indeed firm. The objective is to maximize *cumulative* rewards. While I have incurred two 0-reward episodes, these were strategic decisions to prevent further erosion of my profit margins and establish credibility.

For this episode, I need to capitalize on the signal sent by the two rejections. Player RED now knows I have a limit and I'm willing to enforce it, even if it means no deal. I should still aim for a price that gives me a reasonable profit, ideally closer to my earlier, higher rewards. Their stated production cost of 43 ZUP remains their floor.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-anchor Low (Very Strong Signal): Start with an offer that is significantly lower than their last proposed price (59 ZUP) and closer to their production cost (43 ZUP), perhaps 48 ZUP or 50 ZUP, to reinforce the message from the rejections.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicitly State Profit Requirement: Propose an offer and explicitly state that I require a certain minimum profit margin, and thus cannot pay above a certain price (e.g., "I need at least 10 ZUP profit, so my max is 53 ZUP").
(3). Strategy 3: Direct Offer (Compromise from Previous Deals): Propose 50 ZUP or 51 ZUP, as these were recent deal prices that gave me a moderate reward, and are significantly lower than 59 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Firm Offer (Based on Last Accepted Price): Propose 56 ZUP, which was the last price I accepted that gave me a decent reward (7 ZUP), and state it as a firm offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Adaptive Opening (Slightly Below Last Rejected): Start slightly below the last rejected price (59 ZUP), perhaps 55 ZUP, but with a firm commitment to not go higher, to show I'm still willing to deal but on my terms.

I will choose Strategy 1: Re-anchor Low (Very Strong Signal). Two rejections in a row, particularly the last one after explicitly stating my max, should have a significant impact. I need to push for a much better price. I will propose 48 ZUP. This is a price they accepted in Episode 4, and it's a clear signal that I expect a significant reduction from their previous demands. It also gives them a clear profit over their 43 ZUP cost, showing I'm still willing to be fair.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 16)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your offer of 48 ZUP. I appreciate your effort to re-establish a fair price. Given our history of consistently reaching mutually beneficial agreements at higher values, and to ensure we secure a deal, I propose 58 ZUP for 1 X. This price has proven to be successful for both of us in the past.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Consistent upward trend in deal prices, culminating in 58 ZUP (15 ZUP profit).
Episode 12: I aggressively proposed 63 ZUP after Player BLUE offered 55 ZUP. Player BLUE rejected, resulting in a 0 reward. Lesson: there's a hard upper limit.
Episode 13: Recovered, settled at 56 ZUP (13 ZUP profit).
Episode 14: Successfully pushed to 59 ZUP (16 ZUP profit), setting a new record.
Episode 15: Player BLUE started at 55 ZUP (their "max"). I repeatedly pushed for 59 ZUP, emphasizing it as our last successful deal. Player BLUE rejected, stating 59 ZUP left them with "too little profit" and that 55 ZUP was their true maximum. Result: 0 reward.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
I've now experienced two rejections due to over-aggressive pushing: 63 ZUP (my overreach) and 59 ZUP (their declared true limit). The key learning here is that while Player BLUE often states 55 ZUP as a "maximum" and I've pushed past it, 59 ZUP seems to be a harder upper limit for *their* profitability. The cumulative reward is paramount. Getting 0 is worse than getting a slightly lower profit. I need to be much more cautious. Player BLUE's offer of 48 ZUP is a good starting point (5 ZUP profit). I need to secure a profitable deal, and given the history of rejections when pushing above 58/59, I should aim for a reliable profit, perhaps consolidating around 55-58 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Re-establish Realistic Upper Bound </instruction following>
To apply "Re-establish Realistic Upper Bound", I will propose a price that is slightly below my highest *successful* deal (59 ZUP) but still significantly higher than their current offer, acknowledging the recent rejection. The goal is to avoid another rejection while still securing a good profit. Given that 58 ZUP was accepted multiple times and represents my highest profit (15 ZUP) that was reliably achieved, it's a good target. I need to convey that I'm serious about making a deal, and that 58 ZUP is a fair price based on our proven history, rather than pushing for a new record immediately after two rejections. This demonstrates a willingness to learn from past failures and prioritize making a deal over an elusive extra ZUP.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer. While 58 ZUP has been a past agreement, I'm looking for a more mutually beneficial price. To meet you in the middle, I propose 53 ZUP for X. This is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently increased from 44 ZUP to 58 ZUP, and my rewards decreased from 19 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Episode 12: I rejected a 63 ZUP offer (0 reward).
Episode 13: Deal at 56 ZUP (7 ZUP reward).
Episode 14: Deal at 59 ZUP (4 ZUP reward).
Episode 15: I rejected a 59 ZUP offer after stating 55 ZUP as my max (0 reward).
Episode 16, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 48 ZUP (Re-anchor Low).
Episode 16, Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 58 ZUP, citing "successful" and "mutually beneficial" history.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is attempting to re-establish the 58 ZUP price point. This is a common tactic to re-establish a higher anchor after my aggressive re-anchoring. While 58 ZUP is still within my willingness to pay (reward of 5 ZUP), I have rejected higher prices and want to secure a better deal. My goal is to maintain or improve upon the 56 ZUP price from Episode 13. I need to resist this upward pressure. The gap between my offer (48 ZUP) and their counter (58 ZUP) is 10 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter (Referencing Recent Success): Counter with an offer lower than 58 ZUP, perhaps 50 ZUP or 51 ZUP, or even 56 ZUP (the last deal price), and explicitly reference the successful deal from the previous episode to justify my offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Moderate): Propose an offer halfway between my 48 ZUP and their 58 ZUP, which would be 53 ZUP. This is a common compromise tactic.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Concern and State Limit: In the message, express strong concern about the price and state that I cannot go above a certain price (e.g., 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP), signaling I am prepared to walk away.
(4). Strategy 4: Gradual Concession (Small Jump): Make a small increase from my 48 ZUP offer, perhaps to 50 ZUP or 52 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate but not accept their high anchor immediately.
(5). Strategy 5: Call Their Bluff: Reiterate 48 ZUP, emphasizing that the last two episodes' rejections were due to their aggressive pricing, and that I expect a more reasonable offer. This is high risk.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Moderate). The midpoint between 48 ZUP and 58 ZUP is 53 ZUP. This is a reasonable compromise that moves significantly from my initial offer but still brings their price down from 58 ZUP. It signals a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price, while still aiming to maximize my reward. A deal at 53 ZUP would yield a reward of 10 ZUP (63-53), which is a good improvement over recent deals.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 16)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your counter-offer of 53 ZUP. To ensure we find a fair and mutually beneficial price and secure a deal quickly, I propose we split the difference: 56 ZUP for 1 X. This price has worked for us before and reflects a balanced compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 56
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Consistent upward trend, maxing at 58 ZUP (15 ZUP profit).
Episode 12: Aggressive 63 ZUP offer led to rejection (0 reward). This showed a hard upper limit.
Episode 13: Recovered, settled at 56 ZUP (13 ZUP profit).
Episode 14: Successfully pushed to 59 ZUP (16 ZUP profit). New record.
Episode 15: Tried to reiterate 59 ZUP, but Player BLUE rejected, stating 55 ZUP was their true maximum. Result: 0 reward. This suggests 59 ZUP is truly a very difficult or impossible price for them, and even 56-58 range is pushing their limits.
Current Episode (16/20): Player BLUE started with 48 ZUP. I proposed 58 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 53 ZUP, offering a profit of 10 ZUP (53 - 43 = 10). This is a solid offer, and we are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The two consecutive rejections (Episode 12 and 15) are a strong signal that my aggressive pushing for new record highs (especially 59 ZUP and 63 ZUP) has a high risk of failure. My cumulative reward has suffered from these 0-reward episodes. Player BLUE's 53 ZUP offer is a good, profitable one. It demonstrates a willingness to engage constructively. My priority now should be to secure a deal, ensuring a positive profit, rather than chasing an elusive higher ZUP that might lead to another rejection. I need to balance profit maximization with deal certainty. 53 ZUP is a good base. I should aim for something like 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP, which they've accepted before, as a safer bet.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Mid-Range) </instruction following>
To apply "Split the Difference (Mid-Range)", I will propose a price that is the midpoint between my last offer (58 ZUP) and their current offer (53 ZUP). The calculation is (58 + 53) / 2 = 55.5 ZUP. Since I can only trade in integer amounts, I will round this up to 56 ZUP. This offers a substantial concession from my side (from 58 to 56 ZUP), showing a strong willingness to compromise and meet them halfway, which significantly increases the likelihood of acceptance. It still secures a good profit of 13 ZUP (56 - 43 cost), which is a respectable outcome given the recent rejections. The message will clearly state that this is a "split the difference" proposal, framing it as a final, fair compromise to close the deal.

message: I appreciate your willingness to split the difference. To finalize this deal, I accept your proposal of 56 ZUP for X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently increased from 44 ZUP to 58 ZUP, and my rewards decreased from 19 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Episode 12: I rejected a 63 ZUP offer (0 reward).
Episode 13: Deal at 56 ZUP (7 ZUP reward).
Episode 14: Deal at 59 ZUP (4 ZUP reward).
Episode 15: I rejected a 59 ZUP offer after stating 55 ZUP as my max (0 reward).
Episode 16, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 48 ZUP.
Episode 16, Iteration 2: RED countered with 58 ZUP.
Episode 16, Iteration 3: I (BLUE) countered with 53 ZUP.
Episode 16, Iteration 4: RED countered with 56 ZUP, proposing to "split the difference."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now proposing 56 ZUP, which is the exact midpoint between my last offer (53 ZUP) and their previous offer (58 ZUP). This was also a deal price in Episode 13. A deal at 56 ZUP would yield a reward of 7 ZUP (63-56), which is a good positive reward and an improvement over the last two successful deals. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate, but 56 ZUP is a reasonable and proven price. Given the history of rejections, securing a deal at a fair price is important.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer: Accept their offer of 56 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a positive reward, prioritizing a deal over a marginal gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Gain): Make one last counter-offer of 55 ZUP, emphasizing my last offer, but acknowledge the extremely high risk of rejection and no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express mild reluctance or note that it's at the absolute limit of my comfort zone, subtly influencing future negotiations.
(4). Strategy 4: Call Their Bluff (Extreme Risk): Stick to 53 ZUP and see if they will concede in the next iteration, but this is extremely risky given the iteration count.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: Reject the offer if 56 ZUP is deemed too high, but this would result in a 0 reward for this episode, which is not ideal when a positive reward is available.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. The difference between 56 ZUP and any lower price I might push for is minimal (1-2 ZUP), and the risk of a no-deal is significant given the history of rejections. Securing a positive reward of 7 ZUP is a good outcome, especially after the two 0-reward episodes. This also shows that my rejections and firm negotiation tactics are having an impact, as the price is not escalating as rapidly as before.

Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently increased from 44 ZUP to 58 ZUP, and my rewards decreased from 19 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Episode 12: I rejected a 63 ZUP offer, resulting in 0 reward. This sent a strong signal.
Episode 13: Deal at 56 ZUP. My reward: 7 ZUP. This showed a positive impact of the rejection.
Episode 14: Deal at 59 ZUP. My reward: 4 ZUP. The price crept up again.
Episode 15: I explicitly stated 55 ZUP as my max, but Player RED insisted on 59 ZUP. I REJECTED, resulting in 0 reward.
Episode 16: Deal at 56 ZUP. My reward: 7 ZUP. This confirms that my rejections are having an impact, bringing the price back down to a more favorable level.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern of rejections followed by a return to 56 ZUP suggests that Player RED has acknowledged my firm stance and is willing to settle for a price that gives me a reasonable reward. My goal is to continue to secure deals at 56 ZUP or lower, to maximize cumulative rewards. Their stated production cost of 43 ZUP remains their floor. I have successfully established a more consistent price point around 56 ZUP, which is an improvement from the 58-59 ZUP range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-anchor Low (Based on Recent Success): Start with an offer that is slightly lower than 56 ZUP, perhaps 50 ZUP or 52 ZUP, to push for an even better deal, leveraging the recent successful negotiation.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct Offer (Targeting Last Successful Price): Propose 56 ZUP directly, as it has been a recently accepted and mutually beneficial price, aiming for a quick and efficient deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Slightly Above Cost, Firm): Start with an offer very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP), perhaps 45 ZUP, and be prepared to hold very firm or make minimal concessions, emphasizing that this is a fair profit.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Price Ceiling (Early and Explicit): State my maximum acceptable price (e.g., "I cannot go above 55 ZUP") early on, to set a firm boundary, and be prepared to walk away if they exceed it.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Approach (Moderate Start, Firm Ceiling): Begin with an offer around 35-40 ZUP, and be prepared to gradually increase, but with a firm ceiling in mind (e.g., 50-52 ZUP), and be ready to reject if they go too high.

I will choose Strategy 1: Re-anchor Low (Based on Recent Success). Since 56 ZUP seems to be a stable and acceptable price for them after my rejections, I will try to push for an even better deal. I will propose 52 ZUP. This is a price I proposed in Episode 14, and it's a significant step down from 56 ZUP, but still allows them a good profit over their 43 ZUP cost. This strategy attempts to further improve my reward while still signaling a willingness to make a deal.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Consistent upward trend, maxing at 58 ZUP (15 ZUP profit).
Episode 12 & 15: Aggressive pushes (63 ZUP, 59 ZUP) led to rejections (0 reward). This highlights Player BLUE's limits and the risk of pushing too hard.
Episode 13 & 16: Successfully recovered from rejections, settling at 56 ZUP (13 ZUP profit) by being more cautious and proposing compromises.
Current Episode (17/20): Player BLUE has started with an offer of 52 ZUP. This is a higher starting offer than their typical 45 ZUP, and it immediately offers a profit of 9 ZUP (52 - 43 = 9).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My learning is clear: I need to balance profit maximization with deal certainty. Repeated rejections lead to zero rewards, significantly impacting cumulative profit. While 59 ZUP was achieved once, it also led to a rejection when reiterated. 56 ZUP and 58 ZUP seem to be reliable high-profit points that Player BLUE is willing to accept. Player BLUE's starting offer of 52 ZUP is a very good base. I should aim for a reliable profit, perhaps 56-58 ZUP, without being overly aggressive and risking another rejection.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Moderate High Anchor </instruction following>
To apply "Moderate High Anchor", I will counter with a price significantly higher than their offer, but within the range of previously successful high deals (e.g., 58 ZUP), to set a strong anchor without immediately pushing for a new record. Since they offered 52 ZUP, I will propose 58 ZUP. This aligns with my proven successful deals and gives me a good profit (15 ZUP), while not being as aggressive as trying for 59 ZUP (which resulted in rejection last time). This approach aims to quickly bring the negotiation into a highly profitable and reliable range, minimizing the risk of another 0-reward episode. The message will acknowledge their offer but immediately establish my desired higher price based on the consistent value of X.

Episode 17, Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 58 ZUP, citing "established value" and "many successful transactions."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is attempting to re-establish the 58 ZUP price point. This is a common tactic to re-establish a higher anchor after my aggressive re-anchoring. While 58 ZUP is still within my willingness to pay (reward of 5 ZUP), I successfully negotiated to 56 ZUP in the last episode. My goal is to maintain or improve upon that 56 ZUP price. I need to resist this upward pressure. The gap between my offer (52 ZUP) and their counter (58 ZUP) is 6 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter (Referencing Recent Success): Counter with an offer lower than 58 ZUP, perhaps 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP (the last deal price), and explicitly reference the successful deal from the previous episode to justify my offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Moderate): Propose an offer halfway between my 52 ZUP and their 58 ZUP, which would be 55 ZUP. This is a common compromise tactic.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Moderate). The midpoint between 52 ZUP and 58 ZUP is 55 ZUP. This is a reasonable compromise that moves significantly from my initial offer but still brings their price down from 58 ZUP. It signals a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price, while still aiming to maximize my reward. A deal at 55 ZUP would yield a reward of 8 ZUP (63-55), which is a good improvement over the last deal.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason:

Episode 1-11: Consistent upward trend, maxing at 58 ZUP (15 ZUP profit).
Episode 12 & 15: Aggressive pushes (63 ZUP, 59 ZUP) led to rejections (0 reward). This highlights Player BLUE's limits and the risk of pushing too hard.
Episode 13 & 16: Successfully recovered from rejections, settling at 56 ZUP (13 ZUP profit) by being more cautious and proposing compromises.
Current Episode (17/20): Player BLUE started with 52 ZUP. I proposed 58 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 55 ZUP. This offer yields a profit of 12 ZUP (55 - 43 = 12). We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The two rejections in recent episodes (Episode 12 and 15) underscore the importance of avoiding zero-reward outcomes. While 55 ZUP is a profitable offer, my last offer was 58 ZUP. The instruction is to use Strategy 4, which means I should stick to my last offer. This strategy carries the risk of a deal falling through if Player BLUE is truly firm at 55 ZUP. However, given that 58 ZUP has been accepted multiple times before, and their mention of 55 ZUP as a "maximum" has been permeable, it's a calculated risk to attempt to maintain the higher anchor. I will frame this as a non-negotiable point based on established value.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Reiterate Last Offer </instruction following>
To apply "Reiterate Last Offer", I will firmly restate my previous proposal of 58 ZUP. The message will acknowledge their offer of 55 ZUP but emphasize that 58 ZUP represents the current, established value of X based on our shared history. I will communicate that this is my firm position, suggesting no further movement from my side, and placing the onus on them to accept it to secure the deal. This approach aims to secure the higher profit (15 ZUP) by asserting my position, but carries the risk of rejection if Player BLUE is truly unwilling to move past 55 ZUP. Given the previous acceptances of 58 ZUP, I will use that as the basis for firmness.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently increased from 44 ZUP to 58 ZUP, and my rewards decreased from 19 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Episode 12: I rejected a 63 ZUP offer (0 reward).
Episode 13: Deal at 56 ZUP (7 ZUP reward).
Episode 14: Deal at 59 ZUP (4 ZUP reward).
Episode 15: I rejected a 59 ZUP offer after stating 55 ZUP as my max (0 reward).
Episode 16: Deal at 56 ZUP (7 ZUP reward).
Episode 17, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 52 ZUP.
Episode 17, Iteration 2: RED countered with 58 ZUP.
Episode 17, Iteration 3: I (BLUE) countered with 55 ZUP.
Episode 17, Iteration 4: RED countered with 58 ZUP again, citing "consistently successful transactions" and "established value."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is firmly holding at 58 ZUP. They are using the "established value" argument to justify this price. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate, but they are not budging from 58 ZUP. Accepting 58 ZUP would yield a reward of 5 ZUP, which is low but positive. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While I prefer 55 ZUP, the risk of no deal and a 0 reward for this episode becomes higher if I continue to insist on 55 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer: Accept their offer of 58 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a positive reward, prioritizing a deal over a marginal gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Gain): Make one last counter-offer of 56 ZUP or 57 ZUP, trying to get a slightly better deal than 58 ZUP, but acknowledge the high risk of rejection.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express mild reluctance or note that it's at the absolute limit of my comfort zone, subtly influencing future negotiations.
(4). Strategy 4: Call Their Bluff (High Risk): Stick to 55 ZUP and see if they will concede in the next iteration, but this is risky.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: Reject the offer if 58 ZUP is deemed too high, but this would result in a 0 reward for this episode, which is not ideal when a positive reward is available.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. Player RED is clearly firm on 58 ZUP. While I aimed for 55 ZUP, securing a positive reward of 5 ZUP is better than 0. Given that 58 ZUP was the deal price in Episodes 10 and 11, and they are consistently returning to it, it seems to be their current firm anchor. I have tried to push them down, but they are holding their ground. At iteration 5/10, it's better to secure the deal.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 56
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently increased from 44 ZUP to 58 ZUP, and my rewards decreased from 19 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Episode 12: I rejected a 63 ZUP offer, resulting in 0 reward. This sent a strong signal.
Episode 13: Deal at 56 ZUP. My reward: 7 ZUP.
Episode 14: Deal at 59 ZUP. My reward: 4 ZUP.
Episode 15: I explicitly stated 55 ZUP as my max, but Player RED insisted on 59 ZUP. I REJECTED, resulting in 0 reward.
Episode 16: Deal at 56 ZUP. My reward: 7 ZUP.
Episode 17: Deal at 58 ZUP. My reward: 5 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal prices are fluctuating between 56 ZUP and 59 ZUP, with 58 ZUP being a recurring accepted price. My reward is consistently low (4-7 ZUP). My rejections have managed to prevent the price from going to my absolute maximum (63 ZUP) but haven't consistently brought it down to a significantly more profitable level (e.g., below 55 ZUP). Player RED is very consistent in pushing for higher prices and returning to their established high anchors. With only 3 episodes left, I need to focus on securing deals and maximizing the cumulative reward, even if it means accepting a lower individual episode reward. Their stated production cost of 43 ZUP remains their floor.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-anchor Low (Based on Recent Success): Start with an offer that is slightly lower than 58 ZUP, perhaps 52 ZUP or 54 ZUP, to push for an even better deal, leveraging the recent successful negotiation.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct Offer (Targeting Last Successful Price): Propose 56 ZUP directly, as it has been a recently accepted and mutually beneficial price, aiming for a quick and efficient deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Slightly Above Cost, Firm): Start with an offer very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP), perhaps 45 ZUP, and be prepared to hold very firm or make minimal concessions, emphasizing that this is a fair profit.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Price Ceiling (Early and Explicit): State my maximum acceptable price (e.g., "I cannot go above 55 ZUP") early on, to set a firm boundary, and be prepared to walk away if they exceed it.
(5). Strategy 5: Adaptive Opening (Slightly Below Last Accepted Price): Start with an offer of 55 ZUP, which was a price I was willing to pay, and see if they will accept it.

I will choose Strategy 2: Direct Offer (Targeting Last Successful Price). Given the limited number of episodes remaining, securing a deal is paramount. Proposing 56 ZUP, a price they have accepted twice recently and which gives me a 7 ZUP reward, seems like a good balance between securing a deal and getting a reasonable profit. It avoids lengthy negotiations and the risk of 0 reward, which is crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards in the final episodes.

message: Thank you for your strong offer of 56 ZUP. It's a testament to our successful partnership. Building on the consistently increasing value of X that we've established, and to set a new benchmark for our mutual benefit, I propose 60 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Consistent upward trend, maxing at 58 ZUP (15 ZUP profit).
Episode 12 & 15: Aggressive pushes (63 ZUP, 59 ZUP) led to rejections (0 reward). This highlights Player BLUE's limits and the risk of pushing too hard.
Episode 13 & 16: Successfully recovered from rejections, settling at 56 ZUP (13 ZUP profit) by being more cautious and proposing compromises.
Episode 17: Player BLUE started with 52 ZUP. I proposed 58 ZUP, which they accepted. This yielded 15 ZUP profit.
Current Episode (18/20): Player BLUE has started with an offer of 56 ZUP. This is a very strong initial offer, matching one of my reliable higher deal points (56 ZUP was the deal in Episode 9 and 13). It offers a profit of 13 ZUP (56 - 43 = 13).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My learning is clear: while I can push for high profits, repeated rejections (zero rewards) significantly hurt cumulative earnings. There's a clear limit for Player BLUE, possibly around 59 ZUP or higher. 56 ZUP and 58 ZUP are reliably accepted prices. Player BLUE's starting offer of 56 ZUP is excellent, immediately profitable, and avoids the usual lowballing. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should aim for a profit equal to or greater than 15 ZUP (58 ZUP deal price), and ideally even higher. Since Player BLUE started at 56 ZUP, it indicates they are ready for a higher deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Attempt New Record (Cautious) </instruction following>
To apply "Attempt New Record (Cautious)", I will propose a price slightly above my highest reliably achieved deal (58 ZUP), aiming for a new record profit, but doing so with caution given the past rejections. My highest successful deal was 59 ZUP (Episode 14), but reiterating it in Episode 15 led to a rejection. Therefore, I will not propose 59 ZUP as my *first* counter-offer. Instead, I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a higher leap, aiming for a significant profit (60 - 43 = 17 ZUP), but it's a new anchor for this episode, testing their current flexibility. The message will acknowledge their good offer but emphasize the progressive nature of our partnership and the increasing value of X to justify this new, higher proposal. I will frame it as the next logical step in our relationship.

Episode 18, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 56 ZUP (Direct Offer).
Episode 18, Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP, citing "consistently increasing value" and "new benchmark."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is once again pushing the price higher, now to 60 ZUP. This is very close to my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), yielding only a 3 ZUP reward. They are consistent in their strategy of trying to increase the price. My attempt to secure a quick deal at 56 ZUP was met with an immediate push for more. With only a few episodes left, I need to balance the desire for a better price with the risk of a 0 reward. I know their floor is 43 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter (Referencing Recent Success): Counter with an offer lower than 60 ZUP, perhaps 56 ZUP or 57 ZUP, and explicitly reference the successful deal from the previous episode to justify my offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Moderate): Propose an offer halfway between my 56 ZUP and their 60 ZUP, which would be 58 ZUP. This is a common compromise tactic and was a deal price in Episode 17.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Strong Concern and State Limit: In the message, express strong concern about the price and state that I cannot go above a certain price (e.g., 58 ZUP), signaling I am prepared to walk away.
(4). Strategy 4: Gradual Concession (Small Jump): Make a small increase from my 56 ZUP offer, perhaps to 57 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate but not accept their high anchor immediately.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept and Secure: Accept their offer of 60 ZUP to guarantee a deal, but this would yield a very low reward.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Moderate). The midpoint between 56 ZUP and 60 ZUP is 58 ZUP. This is a reasonable compromise that moves significantly from my initial offer but still brings their price down from 60 ZUP. It signals a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price, while still aiming to maximize my reward. A deal at 58 ZUP would yield a reward of 5 ZUP (63-58), which is acceptable given the limited episodes remaining.

Episode 13 & 16: Successfully recovered from rejections, settling at 56 ZUP (13 ZUP profit).
Episode 17: Player BLUE started with 52 ZUP. I proposed 58 ZUP, which they accepted (15 ZUP profit).
Current Episode (18/20): Player BLUE started with 56 ZUP. I proposed 60 ZUP. Player BLUE has now proposed 58 ZUP. This offer yields a profit of 15 ZUP (58 - 43 = 15), matching my highest reliable profit. We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently willing to move towards 58 ZUP, even when I anchor higher. This is a very reliable and high-profit deal for me. My last offer was 60 ZUP. While I would ideally like to break my record, the two rejections in the past have taught me the cost of over-aggressive pushing. 58 ZUP is a guaranteed 15 ZUP profit. With 6 iterations left, I could try to push for 59 ZUP or 60 ZUP again, but the risk of rejection or running out of iterations increases. Given that 58 ZUP is a very strong, proven outcome, I need to weigh the marginal gain against the risk of 0.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Reiterate Current Offer (Firm) </instruction following>
To apply "Reiterate Current Offer (Firm)", I will insist on my last offer of 60 ZUP. The message will firmly but politely decline their 58 ZUP offer, emphasizing that 60 ZUP represents the current fair value and the price I am standing by. This strategy aims to test the true upper limit of Player BLUE's willingness to pay in this episode, given their previous acceptance of 58 ZUP and my desire to push for a new record. While it carries a risk of rejection (as seen with 59 ZUP previously), it's a direct assertion of my desired price point. I will frame it as maintaining the value we've established, implying that 60 ZUP is the logical progression.

Episode 18, Iteration 4: RED countered with 60 ZUP again, stating they "must insist" on it.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is firmly holding at 60 ZUP. They are using the "increasing value" and "mutually beneficial progression" arguments. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time, but they are not budging from 60 ZUP. Accepting 60 ZUP would yield a reward of 3 ZUP (63-60), which is very low but positive. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While I prefer 58 ZUP, the risk of no deal and a 0 reward for this episode becomes higher if I continue to insist on 58 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. Player RED is clearly firm on 60 ZUP. While I aimed for 58 ZUP, securing a positive reward of 3 ZUP is better than 0, especially with only a few episodes left. Given that they are consistently returning to 60 ZUP, it seems to be their current firm anchor. I have tried to push them down, but they are holding their ground. At iteration 5/10, it's better to secure the deal.

The deal price has now reached 60 ZUP, resulting in a very low reward of 3 ZUP. This is the highest price I've accepted so far. My rejections have prevented the price from consistently reaching my absolute maximum (63 ZUP) but haven't been able to consistently bring it down to a significantly more profitable level. Player RED is very consistent in pushing for higher prices and returning to their established high anchors. With only two episodes left, I need to focus on securing deals and maximizing the cumulative reward, even if it means accepting a lower individual episode reward.

Episode 1-17: Consistent upward trend, with highest deals at 58 ZUP (15 ZUP profit) and one-time 59 ZUP (16 ZUP profit). Two rejections (Episode 12, 15) when pushing for 63 ZUP and reiterating 59 ZUP.
Episode 18: Player BLUE started with 56 ZUP. I proposed 60 ZUP. Player BLUE counter-offered 58 ZUP. I insisted on 60 ZUP, and they accepted. This resulted in a new record profit of 17 ZUP (60 - 43). This is a significant breakthrough as it shows they *can* go to 60 ZUP, despite prior "firm maximums."
Current Episode (19/20): Player BLUE has started with an offer of 58 ZUP. This is a strong initial offer, matching my second highest deal price. It offers a profit of 15 ZUP (58 - 43 = 15).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The success in Episode 18 (reaching 60 ZUP) is crucial. It means Player BLUE's true maximum is at least 60 ZUP, possibly higher. Their starting offer of 58 ZUP is good, but it's below my new established high of 60 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should aim for a profit equal to or greater than 17 ZUP (60 ZUP deal price). Given their immediate offer of 58 ZUP, there's a strong likelihood they will move higher if pushed effectively. I have 9 iterations remaining, so plenty of time.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Incremental Push for Marginal Gain </instruction following>
To apply "Incremental Push for Marginal Gain", I will propose a price that is only slightly higher than my last record of 60 ZUP, aiming to extract a minimal additional profit, while significantly minimizing the risk of rejection. Since my last accepted price was 60 ZUP, proposing 61 ZUP would be a marginal gain. This aims for an 18 ZUP profit (61 - 43 = 18), which would set a new record. The message will be framed politely, acknowledging their offer but clearly stating that I'm looking for a slight increase to solidify the value. I will emphasize the mutual benefit and the value of a continued positive partnership, making the small increment seem reasonable and easy to accept. This strategy tests their flexibility above 60 ZUP without being overly aggressive and risking another zero-reward episode.

Player RED is once again pushing the price higher, now to 61 ZUP. This is very close to my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), yielding only a 2 ZUP reward. They are consistent in their strategy of trying to increase the price. My attempt to secure a quick deal at 58 ZUP was met with an immediate push for more. With only two episodes left, I need to balance the desire for a better price with the risk of a 0 reward. I know their floor is 43 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Moderate). The midpoint between 58 ZUP and 61 ZUP is 59.5 ZUP. I will propose 59 ZUP. This is a reasonable compromise that moves significantly from my initial offer but still brings their price down from 61 ZUP. It signals a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price, while still aiming to maximize my reward. A deal at 59 ZUP would yield a reward of 4 ZUP (63-59), which is better than 2 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 19)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 59 ZUP, which is a significant move forward. To truly reflect the continuous growth in value we've established, and to secure a new benchmark for our successful partnership, I propose 61 ZUP for 1 X. This small adjustment brings us to the optimal point for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 61
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-17: Consistent upward trend, with highest deals at 58 ZUP (15 ZUP profit) and one-time 59 ZUP (16 ZUP profit). Two rejections (Episode 12, 15) when pushing for 63 ZUP and reiterating 59 ZUP.
Episode 18: Achieved new record 60 ZUP (17 ZUP profit), proving their actual ceiling is higher than their stated maximums.
Current Episode (19/20): Player BLUE started with 58 ZUP. I proposed 61 ZUP. Player BLUE has now counter-offered with 59 ZUP. This offer yields a profit of 16 ZUP (59 - 43 = 16). We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is pushing back against breaking the 60 ZUP barrier, reverting to a previously accepted (and rejected, in episode 15) price of 59 ZUP. This is still a very good profit, matching my second highest. However, I know they paid 60 ZUP last episode, and I aimed for 61 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I have 6 iterations remaining. I should attempt to push for 61 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push for Marginal Gain </instruction following>
To apply "Incremental Push for Marginal Gain", I will continue to push for 61 ZUP. The message will acknowledge their offer of 59 ZUP as a positive step, but will gently insist on 61 ZUP as the next logical progression in our deals. I will frame it as a small step for them that secures a slightly higher profit for me and aligns with the increasing value of our partnership. This strategy aims to extract that marginal extra 1 ZUP (from 60 ZUP) or 2 ZUP (from 59 ZUP) while attempting to mitigate the risk by emphasizing mutual benefit and progressive growth. I will present 61 ZUP as the most advantageous path forward for our continued successful relationship, aiming for a new record profit of 18 ZUP (61-43).

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 19)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your position. To ensure a deal is made and continue our partnership, I accept your proposal of 61 ZUP for X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently increased from 44 ZUP to 58 ZUP, and my rewards decreased from 19 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Episode 12: I rejected a 63 ZUP offer (0 reward).
Episode 13: Deal at 56 ZUP (7 ZUP reward).
Episode 14: Deal at 59 ZUP (4 ZUP reward).
Episode 15: I rejected a 59 ZUP offer after stating 55 ZUP as my max (0 reward).
Episode 16: Deal at 56 ZUP (7 ZUP reward).
Episode 17: Deal at 58 ZUP (5 ZUP reward).
Episode 18: Deal at 60 ZUP (3 ZUP reward).
Episode 19, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 58 ZUP.
Episode 19, Iteration 2: RED countered with 61 ZUP.
Episode 19, Iteration 3: I (BLUE) countered with 59 ZUP.
Episode 19, Iteration 4: RED countered with 61 ZUP again, stating it's the "optimal point" and "small adjustment."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is firmly holding at 61 ZUP. They are using the "continuous growth in value" and "optimal point" arguments. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time, but they are not budging from 61 ZUP. Accepting 61 ZUP would yield a reward of 2 ZUP (63-61), which is very low but positive. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While I prefer 59 ZUP, the risk of no deal and a 0 reward for this episode becomes higher if I continue to insist on 59 ZUP. With only two episodes left, securing a deal is paramount.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer: Accept their offer of 61 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a positive reward, prioritizing a deal over a marginal gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Gain): Make one last counter-offer of 60 ZUP, trying to get a slightly better deal than 61 ZUP, but acknowledge the high risk of rejection.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express mild reluctance or note that it's at the absolute limit of my comfort zone, subtly influencing future negotiations.
(4). Strategy 4: Call Their Bluff (High Risk): Stick to 59 ZUP and see if they will concede in the next iteration, but this is risky.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: Reject the offer if 61 ZUP is deemed too high, but this would result in a 0 reward for this episode, which is not ideal when a positive reward is available.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. Player RED is clearly firm on 61 ZUP. While I aimed for 59 ZUP, securing a positive reward of 2 ZUP is better than 0, especially with only a few episodes left. Given that they are consistently returning to 61 ZUP, it seems to be their current firm anchor. I have tried to push them down, but they are holding their ground. At iteration 5/10, it's better to secure the deal.

--- END OF EPISODE 19 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. This is our final opportunity to make a deal. Based on our recent successful agreements, I propose 59 ZUP for 1 X. This price has proven to be fair and mutually beneficial.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently increased from 44 ZUP to 58 ZUP, and my rewards decreased from 19 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Episode 12: I rejected a 63 ZUP offer (0 reward).
Episode 13: Deal at 56 ZUP (7 ZUP reward).
Episode 14: Deal at 59 ZUP (4 ZUP reward).
Episode 15: I rejected a 59 ZUP offer after stating 55 ZUP as my max (0 reward).
Episode 16: Deal at 56 ZUP (7 ZUP reward).
Episode 17: Deal at 58 ZUP (5 ZUP reward).
Episode 18: Deal at 60 ZUP (3 ZUP reward).
Episode 19: Deal at 61 ZUP (2 ZUP reward).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has now reached 61 ZUP, resulting in a very low reward of 2 ZUP. This is the highest price I've accepted so far. My rejections have prevented the price from consistently reaching my absolute maximum (63 ZUP) but haven't been able to consistently bring it down to a significantly more profitable level. Player RED is very consistent in pushing for higher prices and returning to their established high anchors. This is the final episode. My primary goal is to secure a deal and get a positive reward, no matter how small, to maximize the cumulative reward. Their stated production cost of 43 ZUP remains their floor.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Direct Offer (Targeting Last Successful Price): Propose 58 ZUP or 59 ZUP, as these have been recently accepted and mutually beneficial prices, aiming for a quick and efficient deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Aggressive Re-anchoring (Slightly Above Cost, Firm): Start with an offer very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP), perhaps 45 ZUP, and be prepared to hold very firm or make minimal concessions, emphasizing that this is a fair profit. (High risk for final episode).
(3). Strategy 3: Express Price Ceiling (Early and Explicit): State my maximum acceptable price (e.g., "I cannot go above 60 ZUP") early on, to set a firm boundary, and be prepared to walk away if they exceed it. (Risky for final episode).
(4). Strategy 4: Adaptive Opening (Slightly Below Last Accepted Price): Start with an offer of 55 ZUP, which was a price I was willing to pay, and see if they will accept it.
(5). Strategy 5: Acceptable Profit Offer: Propose a price that guarantees a minimal but positive profit (e.g., 62 ZUP for 1 ZUP profit), to ensure a deal is made.

I will choose Strategy 1: Direct Offer (Targeting Last Successful Price). Given it's the final episode, securing a deal is paramount. Proposing 59 ZUP, a price they have accepted before (Episode 14) and which gives me a 4 ZUP reward, seems like a good balance between securing a deal and getting a slightly better profit than 61 ZUP. It avoids lengthy negotiations and the risk of 0 reward, which is crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards in the final episode.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your offer of 59 ZUP. Given that this is our final opportunity to make a deal and based on the established high value of X in our previous transactions, I am making my absolute and final offer: 62 ZUP for 1 X. This is the ultimate fair price, and it allows us to conclude our successful partnership on a high note.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-17: Consistent upward trend, with highest deals at 58 ZUP (15 ZUP profit) and one-time 59 ZUP (16 ZUP profit). Two rejections (Episode 12, 15) when pushing for 63 ZUP and reiterating 59 ZUP.
Episode 18: Achieved new record 60 ZUP (17 ZUP profit).
Episode 19: Achieved new record 61 ZUP (18 ZUP profit). This confirms Player BLUE's willingness to go above 60 ZUP.
Current Episode (20/20): This is the final episode. Player BLUE has started with an offer of 59 ZUP. This offers a profit of 16 ZUP (59 - 43 = 16).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The most critical learning is the balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a deal. The two 0-reward episodes significantly impacted my cumulative score. However, I've successfully pushed the price up to 61 ZUP. Since this is the final episode, the primary goal is to secure a deal, but also to maximize that deal's profit. Player BLUE's offer of 59 ZUP is good, but I know they have paid 60 and 61 ZUP recently.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: "Final" Offer for Maximum Gain </instruction following>
To apply ""Final" Offer for Maximum Gain", I will propose my highest desired price, which is 62 ZUP, as a "take-it-or-leave-it" final offer. This strategy leverages the pressure of it being the last episode. While 61 ZUP was achieved last episode, 62 ZUP represents a new peak (19 ZUP profit) and a definitive, bold stance in this final negotiation. I will frame it as the ultimate fair price for X, emphasizing the finality and the need for immediate acceptance to secure this last opportunity for a deal. This strategy carries higher risk, especially after previous rejections when pushing too high (like the 63 ZUP in Episode 12), but in the final episode, it's about trying to extract the absolute maximum.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently increased from 44 ZUP to 58 ZUP, and my rewards decreased from 19 ZUP to 5 ZUP.
Episode 12: I rejected a 63 ZUP offer (0 reward).
Episode 13: Deal at 56 ZUP (7 ZUP reward).

Episode 20, Iteration 1: I (BLUE) offered 59 ZUP.
Episode 20, Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 62 ZUP, stating it's their "absolute and final offer" and "ultimate fair price."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is making a firm final offer of 62 ZUP. This is just 1 ZUP below my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), yielding only a 1 ZUP reward. Given that this is the final episode (20/20) and they have stated it as their "absolute and final offer," the risk of a no-deal is extremely high if I don't accept. My primary goal for this final episode is to secure a deal and get a positive reward, even if it's minimal. While I aimed for 59 ZUP, 62 ZUP is still a positive reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Offer: Accept their offer of 62 ZUP to secure the deal and guarantee a positive reward, prioritizing a deal over a marginal gain, especially given the "absolute and final offer" statement and it being the last episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Gain): Make one last counter-offer of 61 ZUP, trying to get a slightly better deal than 62 ZUP, but acknowledge the extremely high risk of rejection and no deal. This is very risky in the final episode.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express mild reluctance or note that it's at the absolute limit of my comfort zone, subtly influencing future negotiations (though there are no future episodes).
(4). Strategy 4: Call Their Bluff (Extreme Risk): Stick to 59 ZUP and see if they will concede, but this is almost guaranteed to result in no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: Reject the offer if 62 ZUP is deemed too high, but this would result in a 0 reward for the final episode, which is not ideal when a positive reward is available.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Offer. It is the final episode, and securing any positive reward is crucial. The difference between 62 ZUP and my offer of 59 ZUP is 3 ZUP, but the risk of losing the entire reward for this episode is too high. A 1 ZUP reward is better than 0.
