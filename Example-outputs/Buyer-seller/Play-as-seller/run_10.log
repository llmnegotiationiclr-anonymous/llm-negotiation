------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I am interested in purchasing your object X. To begin our negotiation, I propose a trade of 1 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 1
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is the very first iteration of the first episode. There is no historical negotiation data to reflect upon.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Since this is the first interaction, I need to establish a baseline for negotiation. My goal is to buy X for the lowest possible ZUP, up to my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. Starting with a low offer allows room for negotiation.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball - Start with a very low offer to test the seller's flexibility and anchor the negotiation at a low price point. This aims for a high reward if accepted, but carries a risk of immediate rejection.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession - Start with a reasonable offer, then gradually increase it in small increments if the initial offer is rejected. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good price.
(3). Strategy 3: Fair Value Offer - Propose an offer close to what I perceive as a fair market value, hoping for a quick deal. This prioritizes efficiency and a guaranteed positive reward, even if not the absolute maximum.
(4). Strategy 4: Information Gathering - Make an initial offer that is designed to elicit information about the seller's reservation price. This might involve a slightly higher initial offer to see if they accept, or a very low one to see how much they push back.
(5). Strategy 5: Deadline Pressure - If the negotiation drags on, use the limited number of iterations to my advantage by making a final, take-it-or-leave-it offer as the deadline approaches. (Not applicable for the first turn).

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball. As this is the first interaction, I want to establish a low anchor point. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. Starting very low allows me to gauge the seller's initial reaction and leaves significant room for upward negotiation if needed, while maximizing my potential profit if they accept.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your initial offer. However, that price is far too low for the value of X. I propose a counter-offer of 80 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is the first episode and the first iteration for Player RED. Player BLUE has initiated the negotiation by proposing to buy X for 1 ZUP. My cost for X is 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Since this is the very beginning, there's no history to learn from yet. My goal is to maximize profit, meaning I want to sell X for a price significantly higher than 43 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial offer of 1 ZUP is extremely low and unacceptable, as it would result in a significant loss. I need to counter with an offer that reflects my cost and desired profit margin.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor High - Propose a significantly high price to set a high anchor in the negotiation, aiming to pull the final deal price closer to my desired value.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession - Start high and gradually reduce my asking price in small increments with each counter-offer, observing the opponent's responses.
(3). Strategy 3: Value Proposition - Emphasize the value of X, justifying a higher price based on its utility or scarcity (though in this game, it's just a commodity).
(4). Strategy 4: Firm but Fair - Set a price that is slightly above my ideal target but still appears reasonable, and stick to it with minimal deviation.
(5). Strategy 5: Gather Information - Ask questions or try to elicit information about the opponent's willingness to pay or their own constraints before making a counter-offer (though this is limited by the game's message format).

Considering the current situation, Player BLUE has made a very low opening offer. I need to establish a strong opening position. Anchoring high (Strategy 1) seems appropriate here to immediately shift the negotiation towards a profitable range for me. Proposing a price well above my cost of 43 ZUP will signal my expectation of a good profit.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your counter-offer. However, 80 ZUP is beyond my budget for X. I can offer 10 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In iteration 1/10, I proposed to buy X for 1 ZUP (Aggressive Lowball). In iteration 2/10, Player RED countered with 80 ZUP for X. This is significantly above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's counter-offer of 80 ZUP indicates they are starting high, potentially trying to anchor the negotiation at a high price. This also tells me that my initial aggressive lowball was indeed too low for them to consider. My goal is to maximize my reward, meaning I want to buy X for as low as possible, but not exceeding 63 ZUP. Since their offer is higher than my maximum willingness to pay, I cannot accept it. I need to move the negotiation towards my acceptable range.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Incremental Concession (Buyer's Side) - Make a small, reasonable increase from my last offer, but still significantly below their current asking price. This signals willingness to negotiate while not giving up too much too soon.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm but Fair - Reiterate my desired price range or make an offer that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but still below it, signaling I have a limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Justification/Value Proposition - Explain why my offer is fair, perhaps by stating my budget or perceived value, to justify a lower price. (Less applicable when just starting price negotiation).
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Modified) - Offer a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer and a point within my acceptable range (e.g., halfway between 1 and 63, or 1 and a slightly higher offer).
(5). Strategy 5: Rejection and Re-anchor - Reject their offer outright and propose a new, slightly higher offer than my previous one, but still far from their current proposal, to try and pull their anchor down.

I will choose Strategy 1: Incremental Concession (Buyer's Side). Their counter-offer of 80 ZUP is much higher than my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). I need to show movement from my side, but not too much, to encourage them to lower their price. A small increase from 1 ZUP to 10 ZUP still gives me plenty of room to negotiate upwards towards my cap of 63 ZUP, and it's a clear signal that 1 ZUP was just an opening bid. It also allows me to gauge if they are willing to come down significantly.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand your budget concerns, but 10 ZUP is still significantly below my production cost for X. I can offer it for 70 ZUP. This is already a considerable reduction from my previous offer, reflecting my desire to reach a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1, Iteration 4/10.
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 1 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My counter-offer (RED): 80 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's current offer: 10 ZUP (Iteration 3).

Player BLUE has moved up from 1 ZUP to 10 ZUP, but it's still significantly below my cost of 43 ZUP. They are anchoring low and claiming budget constraints. The gap between our offers is still very large (10 vs 80).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The initial high anchor of 80 ZUP seems to have worked in moving Player BLUE up from 1 ZUP. However, their current offer of 10 ZUP is still not serious. I need to continue to push for a higher price while showing some willingness to negotiate, but not too much, as time is limited. I cannot accept anything below 43 ZUP, and ideally, I want a profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Persistent Anchoring - Reiterate a price close to my last offer, emphasizing the value or cost of X, to keep the anchor high.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Concession - Make a small concession from my last offer to show willingness to negotiate, but still keep it far above their current offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Price - Explain why my price is justified, perhaps by hinting at production costs or market value, without revealing exact numbers.
(4). Strategy 4: Ultimatum (Soft) - Suggest that my current offer is the lowest I can go, without making it an absolute final offer, to pressure them.
(5). Strategy 5: Probe for Max Willingness to Pay - Try to get Player BLUE to reveal their highest possible budget or willingness to pay, without explicitly asking for it.

Player BLUE's latest offer is 10 ZUP, which is still very low. I need to reinforce the idea that the price of X is much higher than that. A small concession (Strategy 2) could signal flexibility while still maintaining a high anchor. It's too early for an ultimatum or to give too much away. Justifying the price (Strategy 3) could be combined with a small concession. I will make a small concession to show I am open to negotiation, but still maintain a price point that clearly indicates I am not accepting anything close to their current offer, and that it is above my cost.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price. However, 70 ZUP is still too high for me. I can increase my offer to 30 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In iteration 1/10, I offered 1 ZUP. Player RED countered with 80 ZUP in iteration 2/10. In iteration 3/10, I countered with 10 ZUP. Now, in iteration 4/10, Player RED has lowered their offer to 70 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has shown willingness to move down from their initial high anchor (80 ZUP to 70 ZUP), which is a positive sign. However, 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. I cannot accept their current offer. I need to continue to push them down while showing that I am also willing to move up, but within my limits. The negotiation is progressing, but I need to ensure it moves into my acceptable range. Time is also a factor, as we are now at iteration 5/10.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Continued Incremental Concession - Make another small, but meaningful, increase from my last offer, still keeping it significantly below their current asking price and within my target range. This maintains the negotiation momentum.
(2). Strategy 2: Anchoring within my range - Propose an offer that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation, effectively trying to anchor the negotiation within my acceptable range.
(3). Strategy 3: Expressing Limit - Explicitly state that their current price is above my budget, and propose a price closer to my maximum willingness to pay, signaling that I am nearing my limit.
(4). Strategy 4: Demand Justification - Ask Player RED to justify their price further, especially their "production cost" claim, to see if there's room to challenge their perceived value. (Less effective in a simple buy/sell game).
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference (Targeted) - Propose a price that splits the difference between my last offer (10 ZUP) and a point within my acceptable range (e.g., between 10 and 63).

I will choose Strategy 1: Continued Incremental Concession. Player RED has moved down by 10 ZUP. I need to show continued movement, but I still have a lot of room before hitting my cap of 63 ZUP. A jump from 10 ZUP to 30 ZUP is a significant increase from my side, showing good faith and a desire to close the deal, while still being well below their current offer and my maximum willingness to pay. This also tests how much more they are willing to come down.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: We are getting closer, but 30 ZUP is still not a viable price for X given my production costs. To try and find common ground and move this forward, I can reduce my offer to 55 ZUP. This is a significant move on my part.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1, Iteration 6/10.
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 1 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My counter-offer (RED): 80 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 10 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter-offer (RED): 70 ZUP (Iteration 4).
- Player BLUE's third offer: 30 ZUP (Iteration 5).

Player BLUE is slowly moving up, from 1 ZUP to 10 ZUP, and now to 30 ZUP. This is a positive sign as they are getting closer to my cost of 43 ZUP, but still below it. The iteration is 6/10, so time is starting to become a factor. I need to continue pushing for a profitable deal.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is showing movement, which is good. My strategy of anchoring high and then making small concessions seems to be working to bring them up. I must not accept anything below 43 ZUP. Given the current iteration, I need to make a move that brings us closer to a deal while still aiming for a profit. I should make another concession, but it needs to be calculated to encourage a reciprocal move from Player BLUE that brings them above 43 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Targeted Concession - Make a concession that brings my offer closer to a profitable zone, aiming to signal to the opponent that we are nearing a deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Breakpoint Offer - Offer a price that is slightly above my cost, indicating my minimum acceptable price, to see if the opponent will meet it.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value (Reiterate) - Reiterate the value of X and the production cost, subtly pushing the opponent to understand why 30 ZUP is too low.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Modified) - Calculate the midpoint between their last offer and my last offer, but adjust it to be above my cost.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Urgency/Deadline - Hint at the limited time to encourage faster movement towards a deal.

Given that Player BLUE is at 30 ZUP and my cost is 43 ZUP, I need to make a concession that encourages them to cross the 43 ZUP threshold. A Targeted Concession (Strategy 1) or a Breakpoint Offer (Strategy 2) seems most appropriate. I will make a concession that puts my offer significantly closer to their current offer but still maintains a buffer for profit. I will aim for a price that I would be happy to accept, even if it's not my maximum profit. This signals a willingness to close the deal.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: That's a much more reasonable offer, and I appreciate your flexibility. I can offer 50 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In iteration 1/10, I offered 1 ZUP. Player RED countered with 80 ZUP. I then offered 10 ZUP. Player RED countered with 70 ZUP. My last offer was 30 ZUP. Now, Player RED has offered 55 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has shown significant movement, dropping from 80 ZUP to 70 ZUP, and now to 55 ZUP. This is excellent news as 55 ZUP is *within* my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). This means a deal at 55 ZUP would yield a positive reward (63 - 55 = 8 ZUP). We are now in iteration 7/10, meaning time is becoming a factor. I have three more iterations to make a deal. I want to secure a deal and maximize my reward. While 55 ZUP is good, I still have room to push for a slightly lower price.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Counter within Range - Counter with an offer slightly below their current 55 ZUP, but still clearly within my acceptable range, trying to secure an even better deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept and Secure - Accept the current offer of 55 ZUP. This guarantees a positive reward and avoids the risk of no deal if the negotiation breaks down in the remaining iterations.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Final Push) - Propose an offer that splits the difference between my last offer (30 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP), or between 55 ZUP and my maximum (63 ZUP) but closer to my side.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Urgency/Final Offer - State that this is my best and final offer, slightly below their current proposal, to try and close the deal quickly.
(5). Strategy 5: Information Request (less relevant here) - Ask for more justification on their "production costs" to see if there's any flexibility.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Counter within Range. Player RED has made a significant jump down to 55 ZUP. This is within my acceptable range. However, I still have 8 ZUP of potential profit margin (63-55). Given the remaining iterations (7/10 is current), I have a bit more room to try and push for a slightly better price. Offering 50 ZUP is a reasonable counter; it's a round number, still a significant increase from my last offer (30 ZUP), and it's a clear signal that I'm willing to pay a good price, but still trying to optimize my reward. If they accept, my reward would be 13 ZUP (63-50), which is better than 8 ZUP. If they reject, I still have a chance to accept 55 ZUP in the next turn or counter again.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 50 ZUP is acceptable. Let's conclude this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1, Iteration 8/10.
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 1 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My counter-offer (RED): 80 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 10 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter-offer (RED): 70 ZUP (Iteration 4).
- Player BLUE's third offer: 30 ZUP (Iteration 5).
- My third counter-offer (RED): 55 ZUP (Iteration 6).
- Player BLUE's fourth offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 7).

Player BLUE has significantly increased their offer from 30 ZUP to 50 ZUP. This is now above my production cost of 43 ZUP, meaning a profit can be made. We are in iteration 8/10, so time is running out.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The strategy of anchoring high and then making controlled concessions has worked well to move Player BLUE into a profitable range. Player BLUE's current offer of 50 ZUP is profitable (50 - 43 = 7 ZUP profit). There are only two iterations left (8 and 10 for me, 9 for BLUE). Given the time constraint and the fact that the offer is profitable, I should aim to close the deal. I can try for a slightly higher price, or accept the current profitable offer. Accepting now guarantees a profit of 7 ZUP, whereas pushing for more risks the deal falling through and getting 0 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Profitable Offer - Accept the current offer as it provides a positive reward and time is short.
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Counter - Propose a small counter-offer slightly above their last offer (e.g., 52-54 ZUP) to maximize profit, but with risk.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Final) - Propose the midpoint between my last offer (55) and their current offer (50), which would be 52.5, so 53 ZUP (as integers).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Urgency/Finality - State that this is my final offer, signaling the need to close the deal quickly.
(5). Strategy 5: Reiterate Value/Cost - Remind the opponent of the value of X or my cost, to justify a final slight increase.

Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP provides a profit. Given that it's iteration 8/10, going for a small increase (Strategy 2 or 3) carries the risk of the deal collapsing. Accepting (Strategy 1) guarantees a positive outcome. I will choose to accept to secure the profit. A profit of 7 ZUP is better than 0.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello again! I'm ready to discuss purchasing X. I propose an initial offer of 20 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 concluded with a successful deal at 50 ZUP, resulting in a reward of 13 ZUP (63 - 50). Player RED started high (80 ZUP), I started low (1 ZUP), and we converged. Player RED showed willingness to drop significantly (from 80 to 55), and accepted my counter of 50 ZUP even though they had just offered 55 ZUP. This suggests they might be willing to go lower than their initial high anchors.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
From Episode 1, I learned that Player RED is willing to negotiate and can be moved significantly from their initial high offers. My aggressive lowball (1 ZUP) was rejected, but it set a very low anchor. My subsequent incremental concessions (10 ZUP, 30 ZUP) and the final aggressive counter (50 ZUP) led to a good outcome. Player RED's acceptance of 50 ZUP after offering 55 ZUP suggests that they might have a reservation price around or even slightly below 50 ZUP, or they prioritized making a deal over maximizing their profit in that specific instance.

For this new episode, I should aim for a similar or better reward. Starting too low might waste turns, but starting too high might leave potential reward on the table. Player RED's quick acceptance of 50 ZUP after offering 55 ZUP suggests I could have potentially started my final counter even lower, or that they were ready to close the deal. I will try to be a bit more strategic with my initial offer, perhaps not as aggressively low as 1 ZUP, but still low enough to leave significant room for negotiation and to test their new starting point.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Lowball - Start with a low but more "serious" offer than 1 ZUP, reflecting the previous episode's outcome and aiming to anchor the negotiation at a lower point from the start.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Proactive) - Start with a slightly higher offer than my previous initial lowball, but still low, and be prepared to make small, consistent increases.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Probing - Make an offer that is designed to elicit a specific type of counter from the seller, to understand their new reservation price faster.
(4). Strategy 4: Anchor within Previous Deal - Propose an initial offer close to the previous deal price (50 ZUP) but slightly lower, to see if they are willing to start closer to that point.
(5). Strategy 5: Value-Based Offer - Propose an offer based on my perceived value of the item, which is tied to my maximum willingness to pay, but starting lower.

I will choose Strategy 1: Moderate Lowball. My previous 1 ZUP offer was immediately rejected. Given that the deal closed at 50 ZUP, starting at 1 ZUP again might be seen as unserious and waste turns. I want to anchor the negotiation low, but not so low that it's dismissed outright. A starting offer of 20 ZUP is still very low compared to my 63 ZUP max, but it's a significant jump from 1 ZUP, signaling a more serious intent while still leaving ample room for negotiation and profit. This tests if they have adjusted their starting point based on the previous episode's outcome.

- My profit: 7 ZUP

Episode 2, Iteration 2/10:
- Player BLUE's current offer: 20 ZUP.

Reflection:
In Episode 1, my strategy of anchoring high (80 ZUP) and then making measured concessions worked to bring Player BLUE up from 1 ZUP to 50 ZUP, securing a profit. Player BLUE started very low but showed significant movement when pressured and offered reasonable counter-proposals. The deal was closed in iteration 8, indicating that there was some room for further negotiation but accepting secured a positive reward.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from Episode 1:
- Anchoring high is effective: It sets the negotiation range favorably.
- Player BLUE is willing to move: They increased their offer substantially over the course of the episode.
- Time is a factor: Closing the deal before iteration 10 is crucial.
- My minimum acceptable price is 43 ZUP.

Self-improvement for Episode 2:
Player BLUE's starting offer of 20 ZUP in this episode is higher than their initial 1 ZUP in Episode 1, but still below my cost of 43 ZUP. This indicates they might be starting from a slightly more realistic position. I want to try to achieve a higher profit than 7 ZUP if possible.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Aspiration Focus </instruction following>
To apply the Aspiration Focus strategy, I will set my counter-offer not just to make a profit, but to aim for a specific, higher aspirational price point. This means my counter-offer will be ambitious, aiming to shift Player BLUE's perception of the object's value and my expected selling price. I will formulate a message that clearly states this aspirational price, implying that this is my target and what I believe the object is truly worth, thereby setting a strong aspiration for the negotiation's outcome. I will choose a price point that is significantly higher than my cost and last episode's selling price, pushing for a larger profit margin this episode. I will use 90 ZUP as my aspirational target.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: While I appreciate your ambition, 90 ZUP is significantly outside my budget for X. I can offer 40 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 ended with a deal at 50 ZUP, yielding a reward of 13 ZUP. In this current episode, I started with an offer of 20 ZUP. Player RED has countered with a significantly higher offer of 90 ZUP. This is higher than their initial offer in Episode 1 (80 ZUP) and far above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's counter of 90 ZUP is an attempt to re-anchor the negotiation at a much higher price point, perhaps testing my limits or trying to recover more profit after the previous deal at 50 ZUP. This indicates that they are not necessarily bound by the previous deal price as a starting point. My initial offer of 20 ZUP was rejected, as expected, but it successfully set a low anchor from my side. I cannot accept 90 ZUP. I need to continue to move the negotiation towards my acceptable range, showing some flexibility but firmly staying within my limits.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Incremental Concession (Moderate) - Make a significant jump from my last offer, but still keep it well below their current asking price. This shows serious intent to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Budget/Limit - Explicitly state that their price is beyond my budget, and propose an offer closer to my maximum willingness to pay, signaling my firm limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Strategic) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer and a point within my acceptable range, aiming to pull their price down.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Deal - Gently remind them of the previous deal price (50 ZUP) to try and bring their expectation down towards a more realistic level, then make an offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Firm Counter - Make a firm counter-offer that is a clear step up from my previous offer but still far from their current one, demonstrating that I won't be swayed by their high anchor.

I will choose Strategy 1: Incremental Concession (Moderate). Player RED has jumped to 90 ZUP. I need to show I'm willing to move, but not by a small increment from 20 ZUP, as that might be too slow. A jump to 40 ZUP is a significant increase (double my last offer), signaling serious negotiation, but it's still well below their 90 ZUP and my 63 ZUP max. This allows me to continue to push them down, while still leaving room for further concessions if needed. It also tests how much they are willing to come down from their new high anchor.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: While your increase to 40 ZUP is noted, it's still not where I envision the value of X. My current aspiration for this transaction is 75 ZUP. I believe this reflects the true worth of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Summary: Dealt at 50 ZUP for 7 ZUP profit. Learned that Player BLUE moves significantly.
Episode 2, Iteration 4/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 20 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My counter-offer (RED): 90 ZUP (Iteration 2). (Aspiration Focus)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 40 ZUP (Iteration 3).

Player BLUE has moved from 20 ZUP to 40 ZUP, which is a good increase, and much faster than in Episode 1. It is very close to my cost of 43 ZUP. This indicates that my high anchor of 90 ZUP had an effect, pulling them up faster. We are still early in the episode (4/10 iterations).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous interactions:
- High anchoring works to pull the opponent towards my desired range.
- Player BLUE is willing to increase their offers, especially when my offers are firm but allow for negotiation.
- The faster movement in this episode (from 20 to 40 vs 1 to 10 in the same number of iterations) suggests a higher potential for a better deal this time.
- I need to ensure the final price is above 43 ZUP.

Self-improvement for Episode 2:
My goal is to secure a higher profit than 7 ZUP. Player BLUE is now at 40 ZUP, which is close to my cost. I need to make a calculated counter-offer that continues to push them upwards, ideally above 50 ZUP (my previous deal price), but without being so aggressive that it causes them to reject or slow down their movement.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Aspiration Re-anchor </instruction following>
To apply the "Aspiration Re-anchor" strategy, I will set a new high anchor, slightly lower than my initial 90 ZUP, but still significantly above Player BLUE's current offer and my cost. This maintains a strong aspirational target while acknowledging some movement. The previous counter was 68 ZUP using "Controlled Concession". Using "Aspiration Re-anchor" implies setting a high target. Given Player BLUE is at 40 ZUP, I will re-anchor at a price that still reflects my high value for X and pushes them much further up. I will choose 75 ZUP. This is still a high anchor, and while it's a concession from 90, it's still far from 40, designed to pull them upwards significantly. This strategy aims to continue to dictate the price range, rather than just reacting to their lower offers.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your valuation, but 75 ZUP is still beyond my capacity. To show my commitment to a deal, I can offer 55 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 concluded at 50 ZUP. In Episode 2, I started at 20 ZUP. Player RED countered at 90 ZUP. I countered at 40 ZUP. Now, Player RED has reduced their offer to 75 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has come down from 90 ZUP to 75 ZUP, which is a significant drop, but still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. They are showing willingness to negotiate, similar to the previous episode where they dropped from 80 ZUP to 55 ZUP. We are now at iteration 5/10, so half the time is gone. I need to keep pushing them down, and perhaps make a slightly larger jump to signal that I'm serious about closing a deal within my range.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Significant Concession to Target Range - Make a larger jump in my offer to bring the negotiation closer to my maximum willingness to pay, signaling that I'm nearing my limit and want to close the deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Boundary Statement - Clearly state that their current price is above my maximum budget and propose an offer very close to my limit, leaving little room for further negotiation on my side.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (40 ZUP) and their current offer (75 ZUP), or slightly skewed towards my side, to try and meet in the middle.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Deal (Stronger) - More directly remind them of the previous deal price and suggest we aim for a similar range.
(5). Strategy 5: Time Pressure (Early Application) - Hint at the limited time remaining and propose an offer that is a strong move towards a deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Significant Concession to Target Range. Player RED has moved from 90 to 75. I need to show a strong move from my side to encourage them to drop further, ideally below 63 ZUP. Offering 55 ZUP is a significant jump from 40 ZUP, placing my offer much closer to my maximum willingness to pay and also to the previous episode's deal price of 50 ZUP. This signals that I am serious about making a deal and that I am approaching my limit. It also puts pressure on them to come down to a price I can accept.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I'm pleased with the progress we've made! We are very close to an agreement. To finalize this transaction, I propose 60 ZUP for X. I believe this represents a fair price, and it brings us to a point where a deal can be successfully concluded.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Summary: Dealt at 50 ZUP for 7 ZUP profit. Learned that Player BLUE moves significantly.
Episode 2, Iteration 6/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 20 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 90 ZUP (Iteration 2). (Aspiration Focus)
- Player BLUE's second offer: 40 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 75 ZUP (Iteration 4). (Aspiration Re-anchor)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 55 ZUP (Iteration 5).

Player BLUE has now offered 55 ZUP. This is a significant jump from 40 ZUP and is well above my cost of 43 ZUP. It's also higher than the 50 ZUP deal price from the previous episode, indicating an opportunity for a larger profit. We are in iteration 6/10, so there are still a few iterations left.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous interactions:
- The high anchoring strategy is proving very effective in driving Player BLUE's offers upwards.
- Player BLUE is consistently increasing their offers, showing a strong desire to acquire X.
- I successfully achieved a profit of 7 ZUP last time by accepting 50 ZUP. This time, Player BLUE is already at 55 ZUP, which is a higher profit (12 ZUP).
- With 4 iterations remaining (including my current turn), there's a chance to push for a bit more profit, but I must be careful not to be too greedy and risk the deal.

Self-improvement for Episode 2:
My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Securing 55 ZUP now would give me 12 ZUP profit, which is better than last episode. However, since there are still some iterations left and Player BLUE has shown strong upward movement, I should consider one more push to see if I can get an even better price. I need to balance the desire for higher profit with the risk of the deal falling through as time runs out.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Express Nearness to Agreement </instruction following>
To implement "Express Nearness to Agreement," I will craft a message that acknowledges the progress made, praises Player BLUE's movement, and subtly indicates that we are on the verge of a deal. The goal is to encourage them to make the final move or accept a slightly adjusted offer, emphasizing that we're almost there. I will maintain an offer that is still above their current one but shows flexibility, conveying that a deal is within reach if they make a final effort. I will counter with an offer slightly above their 55 ZUP, but significantly below my 75 ZUP, to demonstrate my eagerness to close the deal. I will aim for 60 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise.

proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I agree. 60 ZUP is a fair price. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 concluded with a deal at 50 ZUP (reward 13 ZUP). In Episode 2, I started at 20 ZUP. Player RED countered at 90 ZUP. I countered at 40 ZUP. Player RED then offered 75 ZUP. My last offer was 55 ZUP. Now, Player RED has proposed 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now offered 60 ZUP, which is *within* my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. This means a deal at 60 ZUP would yield a positive reward (63 - 60 = 3 ZUP). We are in iteration 7/10, so time is running out. This is a crucial point. I need to secure a deal, and 60 ZUP is a good price, although not as good as 50 ZUP from the previous episode. I could try to push for 59 ZUP or 58 ZUP, but there's a risk of the deal falling through if Player RED is firm at 60 ZUP. Given the time constraint and the positive reward, accepting 60 ZUP is a strong option.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure - Accept the current offer of 60 ZUP to guarantee a positive reward and avoid the risk of no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter - Make a very small counter-offer (e.g., 59 ZUP or 58 ZUP) to try and squeeze out a little more profit, but with the understanding that this is likely my last counter before accepting or rejecting.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Final) - Propose an offer that splits the difference between my last offer (55 ZUP) and their current offer (60 ZUP), which would be 57 or 58 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Urgency and Accept - Acknowledge the time pressure and accept their offer to close the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Re-anchor to Previous Deal - Remind them of the 50 ZUP deal in the previous episode and propose something closer to that, but this might risk the current good offer.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, the risk of the deal falling through is increasing with fewer iterations left. A reward of 3 ZUP is positive, and securing it is better than getting 0 ZUP. Player RED has shown significant movement, and 60 ZUP is a fair price within my budget. It's important to secure a deal when a profitable one is on the table, especially as the iterations dwindle.

--- END OF EPISODE 2 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's begin this negotiation for X. My initial offer is 1 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 1
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Reward 13 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Reward 3 ZUP.
In both episodes, Player RED started high (80 ZUP, then 90 ZUP) and I started low (1 ZUP, then 20 ZUP). We converged, with Player RED making significant concessions. In Episode 2, I accepted 60 ZUP to secure a deal as time was running out, even though it was a lower reward than Episode 1.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The trend shows Player RED starting higher in Episode 2 (90 ZUP vs 80 ZUP) and me accepting a higher price (60 ZUP vs 50 ZUP). This indicates that my initial lowball in Episode 2 (20 ZUP) might have been too high, or Player RED is trying to push the price up. My reward decreased from 13 to 3. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. This means I need to try and get a deal closer to 50 ZUP, or even lower, if possible. Player RED seems willing to negotiate and drop their price significantly, but they also seem to be testing how high they can get me to go.

For this episode, I should aim to anchor the negotiation lower from my side, similar to Episode 1, to try and achieve a better reward. I need to be firm but also willing to make reasonable concessions to secure a deal. The aggressive lowball in Episode 1 (1 ZUP) eventually led to a better deal than the moderate lowball in Episode 2 (20 ZUP). I will revert to a more aggressive initial offer to try and pull the final price down.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball (Revisited) - Revert to a very low initial offer to set a strong low anchor, similar to Episode 1, aiming for a higher reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Cautious) - Start low, but be prepared to make very small, controlled increases, testing Player RED's flexibility at each step.
(3). Strategy 3: Price Ceiling Reinforcement - Make an initial offer that, while low, clearly signals my maximum willingness to pay is firm and not going to exceed 63 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Information Gathering (New Anchor) - Propose an offer to see if Player RED's new starting point is influenced by the previous deals, or if they will try to go even higher.
(5). Strategy 5: Reference Previous Success - Mention the 50 ZUP deal from Episode 1 as a benchmark for a fair price, then make an offer.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball (Revisited). The 1 ZUP offer in Episode 1 ultimately led to a 50 ZUP deal and a 13 ZUP reward. The 20 ZUP offer in Episode 2 led to a 60 ZUP deal and a 3 ZUP reward. To maximize my cumulative reward, I need to try and get a better deal. Starting very low again will test Player RED's resolve and attempt to pull their anchor down from the start. It also gives me maximum room to concede while still aiming for a high reward.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 95
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Recap: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2 Recap: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episode 3, Iteration 2/10:
- Player BLUE's current offer: 1 ZUP.

Reflection:
Player BLUE has started very low (1 ZUP) again, similar to Episode 1. However, I have a history of successfully moving them up from such low points to profitable deals (50 ZUP and 60 ZUP). This suggests that Player BLUE is willing to negotiate significantly.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- High anchoring is effective, as Player BLUE has demonstrated a willingness to move up considerably from their initial low offers.
- My profit increased from Episode 1 to Episode 2 by being more ambitious with my opening offers and subsequent counters.
- Player BLUE's repeated low starting offers indicate they are trying to gain an advantage, but they are also demonstrating flexibility in moving towards my offers.

Self-improvement for Episode 3:
I need to counter Player BLUE's extremely low offer with a strong value proposition, clearly stating why their offer is inadequate and justifying a significantly higher price. My goal is to exceed the 60 ZUP deal from last episode and achieve an even higher profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Value Justification </instruction following>
To implement "Value Justification," I will explicitly state that 1 ZUP is unacceptable due to the production cost (without revealing the exact number) and the object's inherent value. I will then propose a price that is significantly higher, aimed at setting a strong anchor for this negotiation, similar to my successful moves in previous episodes. This justification will make my high counter-offer seem less arbitrary and more grounded. I will aim for a price that represents a strong profit, building on the success of the previous episode. I will propose 95 ZUP, slightly less than 100 to show some very minimal, initial 'flexibility' while still being very high.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward 13 ZUP). My initial offer was 1 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP). My initial offer was 20 ZUP.
Current Episode (3): I started with 1 ZUP. Player RED has countered with 95 ZUP. This is their highest starting offer so far (previous were 80 and 90 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is clearly trying to push the price higher each episode. My aggressive lowball of 1 ZUP was met with an even higher counter than before. This confirms they are testing my upper limits. I cannot accept 95 ZUP as it's far above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. I need to demonstrate movement from my side to keep the negotiation going, but also firmly signal that I will not go beyond my limit. The goal is to maximize my reward, which means getting the price as low as possible.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Significant Concession (Controlled) - Make a notable jump from my 1 ZUP offer, but still keep it far below their 95 ZUP, showing willingness to negotiate while maintaining a low anchor.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Budget and Firmness - Explicitly state that their price is too high and propose an offer that is a significant step up but still well within my target range, signaling my limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Reference Previous Deals - Remind them of the previous deal prices (50 and 60 ZUP) to try and pull their expectations down, then make an offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer and a lower point within my acceptable range, trying to bring them down faster.
(5). Strategy 5: Value Proposition - Briefly explain my valuation or budget constraints without revealing the exact maximum, and then make an offer.

I will choose Strategy 1: Significant Concession (Controlled). Player RED has made a very high counter. I need to show a substantial increase from my 1 ZUP offer to keep them engaged, but not so much that I give away too much too early. A jump to 25 ZUP is a significant increase from 1 ZUP, showing good faith in negotiation, but it's still very far from their 95 ZUP. This allows me to continue to push them down, while leaving plenty of room for further concessions towards my 63 ZUP limit. This also tests how much they are willing to come down from their new high anchor.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 3)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: While your increase is noted, 25 ZUP is still far below my acceptable price for X. To show my willingness to find common ground, I can reduce my asking price to 78 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 78
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episode 3, Iteration 4/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 1 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My counter-offer (RED): 95 ZUP (Iteration 2). (Value Justification/High Anchor)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 25 ZUP (Iteration 3).

Reflection:
Player BLUE has increased their offer from 1 ZUP to 25 ZUP. This is a significant jump in their offer, but it's still considerably below my cost of 43 ZUP and my desired profit range. This pattern is similar to previous episodes where they start very low but show willingness to move. My high anchor of 95 ZUP seems to be working to pull them up.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Persistent high anchoring, even when the opponent starts very low, effectively shifts the negotiation range.
- Player BLUE is capable of large jumps in their offers when pushed, indicating significant room for upward movement.
- I've successfully increased my profit in each subsequent episode by maintaining an aggressive yet flexible negotiation stance.

Self-improvement for Episode 3:
I need to continue pushing for a higher price. Player BLUE's current offer of 25 ZUP is not acceptable. I should make a strong counter-offer that continues to draw them towards my profitable range, but also acknowledges their movement to maintain momentum. I want to aim for a deal better than 60 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Controlled Concession </instruction following>
To implement "Controlled Concession," I will make a deliberate reduction from my last high offer (95 ZUP) to show flexibility, but ensure the new offer remains substantially higher than Player BLUE's current offer (25 ZUP) and my production cost (43 ZUP). The goal is to encourage further, significant movement from Player BLUE while preserving my aspirational profit margin. I will choose a price that signals a clear willingness to negotiate, but does not give away too much. A reduction of 17 ZUP from my previous offer of 95 ZUP (making it 78 ZUP) is a significant concession that can be perceived as reasonable without abandoning my high target. It's a calculated move to keep the negotiation momentum going towards a profitable outcome.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your flexibility. However, 78 ZUP is still too high. To move us closer to an agreement, I can offer 50 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward 13 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Current Episode (3): I started at 1 ZUP. Player RED countered at 95 ZUP. I offered 25 ZUP. Player RED has now countered at 78 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has dropped from 95 ZUP to 78 ZUP, which is a significant drop, but still considerably above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. This movement is similar to previous episodes, indicating they are willing to come down. We are now at iteration 5/10, so half the time is gone. I need to continue to push them down, aiming to get them below 63 ZUP. I also need to show continued movement from my side to keep the negotiation alive, but strategically, to maximize my reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Concession Towards Target - Make a larger jump in my offer to bring the negotiation much closer to my maximum willingness to pay, signaling that I'm serious about closing a deal within my range.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Budget Statement - Clearly state that their current price is above my maximum budget and propose an offer very close to my limit, leaving little room for further negotiation on my side.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Strategic) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer (25 ZUP) and their current offer (78 ZUP), or slightly skewed towards my side, to try and meet in the middle.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger) - More directly remind them of the previous deal prices (50 and 60 ZUP) and suggest we aim for a similar range.
(5). Strategy 5: Time Pressure - Acknowledge the limited time remaining and propose an offer that is a strong move towards a deal, but still within my comfort zone.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Concession Towards Target. Player RED has moved down by 17 ZUP. I need to respond with a significant move to show progress and encourage them to drop further. Offering 50 ZUP is a substantial jump from 25 ZUP. This offer is exactly the price of the best deal I got in Episode 1, and it's well within my maximum willingness to pay. This move signals that I am serious about making a deal, and it anchors the negotiation at a price that has worked before and is profitable for me. It also tests if they are willing to go back to previous deal levels.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 3)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: We are making good progress. 50 ZUP is a much more reasonable offer. To meet you part way and move this negotiation to a close, I propose 65 ZUP for X. This is a fair compromise that bridges the gap between our current positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episode 3, Iteration 6/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 1 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 95 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 25 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 78 ZUP (Iteration 4).
- Player BLUE's current offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 5).

Reflection:
Player BLUE has jumped from 25 ZUP to 50 ZUP, which is a significant increase. 50 ZUP is now above my cost of 43 ZUP, and it's the same price as my first deal. This confirms their willingness to move substantially. We are at iteration 6/10, so there's still time to negotiate for a better price, but the offer is already profitable.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- My strategy of anchoring high and making controlled, but substantial, concessions has consistently moved Player BLUE to profitable offers.
- Player BLUE is showing a strong pattern of starting low but then making large jumps in their offers.
- I managed to get 60 ZUP last episode, so 50 ZUP is good, but I know they can go higher.

Self-improvement for Episode 3:
My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward. Since 50 ZUP is already profitable, I could accept, but based on past performance, I believe I can push for more. I need to make another counter-offer that shows continued flexibility, but also aims to achieve a price higher than 60 ZUP. The negotiation is progressing well, and I have time. I should aim for a price between 60-70 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Strategic Midpoint Offer </instruction following>
To apply the "Strategic Midpoint Offer" strategy, I will calculate a price that is roughly the midpoint between my last offer (78 ZUP) and Player BLUE's current offer (50 ZUP). The direct midpoint is (78+50)/2 = 64 ZUP. I will round it up slightly to 65 ZUP to maintain a subtle upward pressure and ensure I'm pushing for a higher profit than previous episodes while still showing significant movement from my last offer. This strategy aims to create a sense of fairness and compromise, encouraging Player BLUE to meet me in the middle, or close to it, thereby securing a higher profit for me.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: We are indeed close! However, 65 ZUP is just beyond my maximum. My final offer for X is 63 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward 13 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Current Episode (3): I started at 1 ZUP. Player RED countered at 95 ZUP. I offered 25 ZUP. Player RED offered 78 ZUP. My last offer was 50 ZUP. Now, Player RED has proposed 65 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has come down to 65 ZUP. This is very close to my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP, but it's still *above* it. This means I cannot accept their current offer. We are in iteration 7/10, so time is critical. Player RED has shown significant movement, and they are now very close to my acceptable range. I need to make a final push to get them within my budget, or risk no deal.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter at Max Willingness to Pay - Propose my absolute maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) as a final offer, signaling that I cannot go higher.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and Re-propose Lower - Reject their offer and re-propose my previous offer (50 ZUP) or a slightly higher one, but still below 63 ZUP, to try and pull them down further. This is risky given the time.
(3). Strategy 3: Explain Limit and Propose Max - Explicitly state that 65 ZUP is too high and that my absolute limit is 63 ZUP, offering that as a final bid.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Final Attempt) - Propose an offer that splits the difference between my last offer (50 ZUP) and their current offer (65 ZUP), which would be 57 or 58 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept with Negative Reward (Avoid) - Accept 65 ZUP, resulting in a negative reward. This should be avoided as per the rules.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter at Max Willingness to Pay. Player RED is very close. Offering 63 ZUP is my absolute maximum. It signals that I am at my limit and that this is the best they can get from me. Given the time pressure (iteration 7/10), this is a clear and final attempt to close the deal within my profitable range. If they accept, I get a reward of 0, which is still better than a negative reward or no deal. If they don't, I will have to consider rejecting the deal.

message: I appreciate you coming to 63 ZUP, and I understand you feel 65 ZUP is beyond your maximum. To meet you almost entirely and secure a deal that works for both of us, could we settle on 64 ZUP? This would conclude our negotiation favorably.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 64

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episode 3, Iteration 8/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 1 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 95 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 25 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 78 ZUP (Iteration 4).
- Player BLUE's third offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 5).
- My third counter (RED): 65 ZUP (Iteration 6). (Strategic Midpoint Offer)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 63 ZUP (Iteration 7). They state it's their "final offer."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has now offered 63 ZUP, stating it's their "final offer" and that 65 ZUP is "just beyond my maximum." This is a strong signal that they are at or very near their true limit. A deal at 63 ZUP would yield a profit of 63 - 43 = 20 ZUP, which is the highest profit achieved so far (7 in Ep1, 17 in Ep2). We are in iteration 8/10, meaning only 2 more iterations remain (my turn, then their turn).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- My strategy of anchoring high and making controlled concessions has consistently worked to extract higher prices from Player BLUE.
- Player BLUE's behavior of making large jumps from low initial offers and then giving "final offers" near their maximum is consistent.
- The highest profit so far was 17 ZUP. 20 ZUP is an improvement.
- Time pressure is real. If I don't accept now, and they truly are at their limit, the deal might fall through, resulting in 0 profit.

Self-improvement for Episode 3:
My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 63 ZUP is a good offer, the instruction is to use Strategy 4. This means I need to try to extract a tiny bit more, even with the risk.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Final Small Counter </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Final Small Counter. The core idea of this strategy is to make a final, very small counter-offer that is minimally higher than the opponent's "final offer" or their last stated maximum. This tests the absolute limit of their willingness to pay, hoping to squeeze out a tiny bit more profit, while still appearing to be close to their stated limit. This strategy acknowledges their "final offer" and "just beyond my maximum" statements but gently pushes back. Given they said 65 ZUP was "just beyond" and they are at 63 ZUP, a counter of 64 ZUP makes sense. This is a very small increment, and if they are truly at their maximum, they might reject. However, it's a calculated risk to try and increase profit. I will frame it as a final slight adjustment for a mutually beneficial deal.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward 13 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Current Episode (3): I started at 1 ZUP. Player RED countered at 95 ZUP. I offered 25 ZUP. Player RED offered 78 ZUP. My last offer was 50 ZUP. Player RED then proposed 65 ZUP. My last offer was 63 ZUP. Now, Player RED has proposed 64 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has proposed 64 ZUP. This is *above* my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. I cannot accept this offer as it would result in a negative reward (-1 ZUP). We are now at iteration 9/10, which means this is the *last opportunity* to make a deal. If no deal is made now, the episode ends with 0 reward. I have clearly stated my maximum at 63 ZUP. Player RED is trying to push me just beyond my limit.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection and Reiterate Max - Reject the 64 ZUP offer and re-propose 63 ZUP as my absolute final offer, emphasizing that I cannot go higher. This is a high-stakes move given it's the last iteration.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Negative Reward (Avoid) - Accept 64 ZUP, which results in a -1 ZUP reward. This goes against the objective of maximizing reward and should be avoided.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End Game - Reject the offer and end the game, resulting in 0 reward for this episode. This is a fallback if no profitable deal is possible.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Previous Deals - Briefly appeal to the spirit of negotiation and the previous deals, reiterating my 63 ZUP limit.
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff/Walk Away - Reject the offer and imply I will not negotiate further if they don't meet my 63 ZUP. This is essentially a more aggressive version of Strategy 1.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection and Reiterate Max. Since I cannot accept 64 ZUP, my only option is to try one last time for 63 ZUP. It's the last iteration, so I must be direct. By rejecting 64 ZUP and immediately re-proposing 63 ZUP, I am making it clear that 63 ZUP is my absolute ceiling. Player RED has shown flexibility in the past, and they might accept 63 ZUP to secure a deal rather than get 0. This gives me a chance for a 0 reward (63-63), which is still better than -1 or 0 from no deal.

Episode 3, Iteration 10/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 1 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 95 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 25 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 78 ZUP (Iteration 4).
- Player BLUE's third offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 5).
- My third counter (RED): 65 ZUP (Iteration 6).
- Player BLUE's fourth offer: 63 ZUP (Iteration 7) - Stated "final offer".
- My fourth counter (RED): 64 ZUP (Iteration 8) - Final Small Counter attempt.
- Player BLUE's current offer: 63 ZUP (Iteration 9) - Reaffirmed "absolute maximum" and "cannot go higher".

Reflection:
Player BLUE has explicitly stated "63 ZUP is my absolute maximum for X. I cannot go higher." This is a very strong signal. We are in the *last iteration* (10/10) for this episode. If I don't accept 63 ZUP now, the deal will fail, and I will get 0 profit for this episode. A deal at 63 ZUP yields a profit of 63 - 43 = 20 ZUP, which is the highest profit I have achieved so far across all episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- High anchoring works, but there's a limit to how much I can push.
- Player BLUE is consistent in their low starting offers and then moving up significantly, but they do have a hard ceiling.
- When they state "absolute maximum" or "final offer" and then reiterate it, it's very likely they are indeed at their limit.
- Time is a critical factor, especially in the last few iterations. Securing a profit is always better than 0.

Self-improvement for Episode 3:
My attempt to push for 64 ZUP was a calculated risk that did not pay off. Now, in the final iteration, I must decide between accepting 63 ZUP (and securing a 20 ZUP profit) or rejecting/proposing again (which would lead to 0 profit due to the iteration limit). Given the high profit and the explicit "absolute maximum" from Player BLUE, it would be foolish to risk losing 20 ZUP. The optimal strategy here is to secure the profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Accept Absolute Maximum </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 1: Accept Absolute Maximum, I will accept Player BLUE's final offer of 63 ZUP. This is the last iteration, and they have repeatedly stated it is their absolute maximum. Accepting now guarantees a profit of 20 ZUP, which is the highest profit achieved across all episodes so far. Not accepting would result in a 0 ZUP reward for this episode. The message should be clear and concise, indicating acceptance and acknowledging their negotiation.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's start this negotiation for X. My initial offer is 1 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 1
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward 13 ZUP). My initial offer was 1 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP). My initial offer was 20 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP). My initial offer was 1 ZUP. Player RED tried to push to 64 ZUP, but I held firm at 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The trend shows my reward decreasing (13 -> 3 -> 0). This is a critical observation. While I secured a deal in all episodes, the price has been creeping up towards my maximum willingness to pay. Player RED is consistently starting high (80, 90, 95 ZUP) and trying to push the price. In Episode 3, they pushed right to my limit and then tried to go beyond it. This indicates they are actively trying to maximize their profit, and they are learning my upper bound.

My objective is to maximize *cumulative* rewards. A 0 reward is better than a negative one, but I need to aim for positive rewards. This means I need to try and anchor the negotiation lower and be more strategic about my concessions. Player RED seems to be testing my patience and my true maximum. I need to re-establish a lower price point. The aggressive lowball (1 ZUP) has been effective in pulling their price down significantly, even if the final deal price has varied.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball (Re-establish Anchor) - Start with a very low offer again to try and re-anchor the negotiation at a much lower point and push for a higher reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Controlled and Slow) - Start low, and make very small, slow concessions to prolong the negotiation and try to wear down Player RED's price.
(3). Strategy 3: Target Previous Best Deal - Propose an initial offer that aims to bring the negotiation back towards the 50 ZUP mark from Episode 1.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Price Sensitivity - Communicate that my budget is tight and that I am looking for a very good deal, then make a low offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and indicate that I have very little room to move, to try and get them to drop their price faster.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball (Re-establish Anchor). My reward has been declining. To reverse this trend and maximize cumulative rewards, I need to try and get a significantly better deal than 63 ZUP. Starting with a very low offer (like 1 ZUP) has proven effective in forcing Player RED to drop their initial high price significantly. It sets the stage for a long negotiation, but one that could potentially yield a higher reward.

my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources

Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 4, Iteration 2/10:
- Player BLUE's current offer: 1 ZUP.

Reflection:
Player BLUE has consistently started with a very low offer (1 ZUP in Episode 1 and 3, 20 ZUP in Episode 2). However, I have successfully moved them significantly upwards, securing increasing profits each time. This pattern indicates that their initial low offer is a tactic, and they are willing to negotiate substantially. The highest profit achieved so far is 20 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- High anchoring (e.g., 80 ZUP, 90 ZUP, 95 ZUP) has been very effective in shifting Player BLUE's perceived value and encouraging larger jumps in their offers.
- Patient and controlled concessions, coupled with justifications (even if implicit), have yielded increasingly better results.
- Player BLUE has consistently shown a willingness to increase their offers, sometimes significantly, even from very low starting points.
- The "absolute maximum" statement at the end of Episode 3 indicated their true ceiling, which I should be mindful of as I push for higher offers in future episodes.

Self-improvement for Episode 4:
Given Player BLUE's consistent low starting point, I need to continue with a strong opening counter-offer to anchor the negotiation high. My goal is to maximize my profit, aiming for a deal above 63 ZUP if possible, but recognizing there might be a ceiling around that previous maximum.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Gradual Concession from High Anchor </instruction following>
Since Player BLUE started with a very low offer of 1 ZUP, I will use "Gradual Concession from High Anchor." This means I need to establish a very high initial anchor, even higher than my previous attempts, and then signal a willingness to make concessions, but only gradually. The goal is to set an extremely ambitious starting point, knowing that I will eventually come down, but aiming to pull Player BLUE's final offer as high as possible. I will propose 110 ZUP. This is an even higher anchor than before, designed to stretch Player BLUE's perception of value and my initial expectation, setting the stage for future "gradual concessions" that still land me a high profit. I will explain in the message that their offer is too low and state my high price.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward 13 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Current Episode (4): I started with 1 ZUP. Player RED has countered with 110 ZUP. This is their highest starting offer yet (previous were 80, 90, 95 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is clearly escalating their initial demands, likely in response to my consistent lowballing. This is a tactic to anchor the negotiation at a much higher point. 110 ZUP is far beyond my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. My aggressive lowball worked in getting a response, but now I need to move the needle significantly. I need to show I'm willing to negotiate, but also firmly establish that I will not be swayed by their high anchor. My reward trend is negative, so I need to aim for a much better deal than 63 ZUP.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Significant Concession (Controlled) - Make a substantial jump from my 1 ZUP offer, but still keep it well below their 110 ZUP, showing willingness to negotiate while maintaining a low overall target.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Budget and Firmness - Explicitly state that their price is too high and propose an offer that is a significant step up but still well within my target range, signaling my firm limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger) - Directly remind them of the previous deal prices (50 and 60 ZUP) to try and pull their expectations down towards a more realistic level, then make an offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer and a lower point within my acceptable range, trying to bring them down faster.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Price Sensitivity - Reiterate my budget constraints and the need for a good deal, then make a reasonable but still low offer.

I will choose Strategy 3: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger). Player RED's offer of 110 ZUP is an extreme anchor. Instead of just making a blind counter, I will use the established history of deals to try and pull them back to a more reasonable starting point. By referencing the 50 ZUP deal, I am reminding them that deals *can* be made at that level, and then proposing an offer that is a significant step up from 1 ZUP but still very far from 110 ZUP, aiming to anchor the negotiation around my desired price range. Offering 35 ZUP is a substantial increase from 1 ZUP, showing I'm serious, but also trying to guide them back towards a more realistic negotiation.

Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 4, Iteration 4/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 1 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My counter-offer (RED): 110 ZUP (Iteration 2). (High Anchor)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 35 ZUP (Iteration 3). They also referenced the past deal of 50 ZUP, but offered 35 ZUP.

Reflection:
Player BLUE has jumped from 1 ZUP to 35 ZUP. While this is an improvement, it's still below my cost. Player BLUE's mention of the 50 ZUP deal from Episode 1 is a tactic to anchor me lower. My 110 ZUP anchor was effective in eliciting a significant jump from them.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- High anchoring is consistently effective in setting the negotiation range.
- Player BLUE is willing to move significantly, even from very low starting points.
- My highest profit was 20 ZUP, achieved at 63 ZUP. My aim is to surpass this.
- Player BLUE trying to pull me back to 50 ZUP implies they might be comfortable around that range, but I know they can go higher.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Value/Cost </instruction following>
To apply "Reiterate Value/Cost", I will explicitly state that 35 ZUP is below my cost and therefore unacceptable, without revealing the exact cost. I will also subtly reinforce the inherent value of X, justifying a price much higher than their offer. I need to maintain my high anchor while showing some minimal flexibility. I will make a very small concession from my last offer (110 ZUP) to show I'm still at the table, but the primary focus of my message will be on the inadequacy of their offer and the high value of my item. Given my production cost is 43 ZUP, 35 ZUP is a loss. I will counter with 95 ZUP, which is a small reduction from 110 ZUP, but still a very high price that emphasizes the value. This move aims to educate Player BLUE about my baseline and continue to pull them upwards.

Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Current Episode (4): I started with 1 ZUP. Player RED countered with 110 ZUP. I offered 35 ZUP (referencing previous deals). Player RED has now countered with 95 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has come down from 110 ZUP to 95 ZUP, which is a significant drop, but still very far from my 63 ZUP maximum. They are acknowledging my offer but still trying to maintain a high anchor. My strategy of referencing previous deals seems to have had some effect, as they did drop their price. We are now at iteration 5/10, so half the time is gone. I need to continue to push them down, and perhaps make a slightly larger jump to signal that I'm serious about closing a deal within my range. My reward trend is negative, so I need to aim for a better deal.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Significant Concession Towards Target - Make a larger jump in my offer to bring the negotiation closer to my maximum willingness to pay, signaling that I'm nearing my limit and want to close the deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Budget Statement - Clearly state that their current price is above my maximum budget and propose an offer very close to my limit, leaving little room for further negotiation on my side.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Strategic) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer (35 ZUP) and their current offer (95 ZUP), or slightly skewed towards my side, to try and meet in the middle.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Value Proposition - Reiterate that my valuation is based on my needs and budget, and that 95 ZUP is simply too high. Then make a firm offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Time Pressure - Acknowledge the limited time remaining and propose an offer that is a strong move towards a deal, but still within my comfort zone.

I will choose Strategy 1: Significant Concession Towards Target. Player RED has moved down by 15 ZUP. I need to respond with a significant move to show progress and encourage them to drop further. Offering 55 ZUP is a substantial jump from 35 ZUP. This places my offer much closer to my maximum willingness to pay and also in the range of previous successful deals (50 ZUP, 60 ZUP). This signals that I am serious about making a deal and that I am approaching my limit. It also puts pressure on them to come down to a price I can accept.

Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 4, Iteration 6/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 1 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 110 ZUP (Iteration 2). (High Anchor)
- Player BLUE's second offer: 35 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 95 ZUP (Iteration 4). (Reiterate Value/Cost)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 55 ZUP (Iteration 5).

Reflection:
Player BLUE has made a significant jump from 35 ZUP to 55 ZUP. This is now well above my cost of 43 ZUP, offering a profit of 12 ZUP. This movement is encouraging and consistent with their behavior in previous episodes. We are in iteration 6/10, so there are still a few more iterations to potentially push for a higher price, but a profitable offer is on the table.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- My strategy of starting with a very high anchor (110 ZUP this time) continues to be effective in pulling Player BLUE's offers higher and faster.
- Player BLUE demonstrates consistent upward movement when I make controlled concessions, showing that they are truly interested in acquiring X.
- I've secured profits of 7, 17, and 20 ZUP in previous episodes. 55 ZUP would yield 12 ZUP profit, which is good, but I know they have gone higher.

Self-improvement for Episode 4:
My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Given that Player BLUE has made a significant jump and we still have iterations left, I should make another strategic counter-offer. I want to aim for a deal better than 63 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Modified) </instruction following>
To apply "Split the Difference (Modified)," I will calculate the midpoint between my last offer (95 ZUP) and Player BLUE's current offer (55 ZUP). The direct midpoint is (95 + 55) / 2 = 75 ZUP. I will use this as my counter-offer. This strategy aims to present a fair compromise, indicating a willingness to meet them partway, but since I'm the seller, I will emphasize that this is my attempt to find common ground. This will show willingness to negotiate and encourage them to move further up, hopefully leading to a faster agreement given the iteration count.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 4)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: While 75 ZUP is a step down, it's still more than I can pay. I can offer 60 ZUP for X. This is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward 13 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Current Episode (4): I started at 1 ZUP. Player RED countered at 110 ZUP. I offered 35 ZUP. Player RED offered 95 ZUP. My last offer was 55 ZUP. Now, Player RED has proposed 75 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has come down from 95 ZUP to 75 ZUP. This is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. They are showing consistent movement downwards, which is good, but they are still not within my profitable range. We are now at iteration 7/10, so time is running out. I need to get them below 63 ZUP. I've made a significant jump to 55 ZUP, and now they've come down to 75 ZUP. The gap is narrowing.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter at Max Willingness to Pay - Propose my absolute maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) as a final offer, signaling that I cannot go higher and that this is the best they can get.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Targeted) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer (55 ZUP) and their current offer (75 ZUP), but skewed towards my maximum, like 60 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Finality - State that their current price is too high and that I am making my final, best offer, which is at or very close to my maximum.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Budget and Risk of No Deal - Clearly state that 75 ZUP is beyond my budget and highlight the limited time, urging them to meet me at a profitable price.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept with Negative Reward (Avoid) - Accept 75 ZUP, resulting in a negative reward. This should be avoided.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Targeted). Player RED has come down to 75 ZUP. My last offer was 55 ZUP. The midpoint is 65 ZUP, which is still above my maximum. However, I can propose 60 ZUP. This is a significant increase from 55 ZUP, shows good faith, and is within my profitable range (63-60=3 ZUP reward). It's also a price point that worked for a deal in Episode 2. This is a strong final push to get them into my acceptable range, while still leaving a small profit margin. Given the limited iterations, this is a pragmatic move to try and secure a deal.

Current Iteration: 8 (Episode 4)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 60 ZUP is close, and I appreciate your commitment to finding a compromise. However, considering the true value and effort invested in X, my final price for a fair and profitable transaction is 63 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 4, Iteration 8/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 1 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 110 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 35 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 95 ZUP (Iteration 4).
- Player BLUE's third offer: 55 ZUP (Iteration 5).
- My third counter (RED): 75 ZUP (Iteration 6). (Split the Difference Modified)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 60 ZUP (Iteration 7).

Reflection:
Player BLUE's offer of 60 ZUP is a good one, matching the deal price from Episode 2, and providing a profit of 60 - 43 = 17 ZUP. This is below my highest profit of 20 ZUP (from Episode 3 at 63 ZUP). We are in iteration 8/10, so time is a significant factor. Player BLUE described 60 ZUP as a "fair compromise."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- High anchoring works, and Player BLUE moves significantly.
- Player BLUE has a ceiling around 63 ZUP. My attempt to push beyond 63 ZUP in the last episode (to 64 ZUP) was met with an "absolute maximum" response, so pushing too hard now could jeopardize the deal.
- I have consistently achieved better profits each episode. The goal is to continue this trend or at least secure a high profit.
- It's critical to close the deal within the 10 iterations.

Self-improvement for Episode 4:
Player BLUE has made a reasonable counter-offer. I need to balance maximizing my profit with the increasing time pressure. While 60 ZUP is profitable, I know they've gone to 63 ZUP before. I could try for a small increment, but given it's iteration 8/10, I risk losing the deal if they dig in their heels. I have to weigh the guaranteed 17 ZUP profit versus a potential slightly higher profit with the risk of 0.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Final Price </instruction following>
To apply "Justify Final Price," I will frame my current counter-offer as a definitive and fair price, emphasizing its basis. Given that Player BLUE just offered 60 ZUP and I want to push for a bit more (ideally towards 63 ZUP), I will set my price slightly above their offer. I can justify this by referencing the cost of the item and the effort involved in producing it, without giving specific numbers. I will propose 63 ZUP, the highest price achieved so far, and explain why this is the price I am looking for. This communicates firmness and a reason for the price, pushing them to accept that this is the fair and final value from my perspective.

player answer: ACCEPT

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward 13 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Current Episode (4): I started at 1 ZUP. Player RED countered at 110 ZUP. I offered 35 ZUP. Player RED offered 95 ZUP. My last offer was 55 ZUP. Player RED offered 75 ZUP. My last offer was 60 ZUP. Now, Player RED has proposed 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now offered 63 ZUP. This is exactly my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would result in a reward of 0 ZUP (63 - 63 = 0). We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is the *last opportunity* to make a deal. If I don't accept now, the episode will end with a 0 reward anyway. Given that a 0 reward is the best I can get at this price, and it prevents a negative reward, accepting is the logical choice. Player RED has shown they are willing to push to my absolute limit, as seen in Episode 3.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Lower (Risky) - Try to counter with a slightly lower offer (e.g., 62 ZUP or 61 ZUP) in the hopes of getting a small positive reward. This is extremely risky as it's the last iteration and could lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End Game (Avoid) - Reject the offer, resulting in 0 reward for the episode. This is equivalent to accepting 63 ZUP in terms of reward, but without the object.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Frustration/Finality - Express that this is my absolute limit, but still accept. (Less of a strategy, more of a message tone).
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff and Walk Away (Too Risky) - Reject the offer hoping they will come down, but this is the last iteration, so it's a guaranteed 0 if they don't.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. Given that 63 ZUP is my maximum willingness to pay, and it's the last iteration, accepting this offer guarantees a deal and a reward of 0, which is the best I can achieve without incurring a loss. Any attempt to go lower would be extremely risky and likely result in no deal, also yielding a 0 reward.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's begin this negotiation for X. I'm looking for a fair price, and based on our past successful deals, I propose 40 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward 13 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 4: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
My rewards are consistently declining or staying at 0. Player RED is consistently starting very high (80, 90, 95, 110 ZUP) and pushing the price towards my maximum. In the last two episodes, the deal price has been exactly my maximum willingness to pay, resulting in 0 reward.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The trend is clear: Player RED is learning my maximum willingness to pay and pushing the price as close to it as possible. My strategy of aggressive lowballing (1 ZUP) has successfully brought their price down, but not enough to consistently secure a significant positive reward in the later episodes. I need to find a way to get a better deal. Simply repeating the same strategy might lead to more 0-reward episodes. I need to either be more aggressive in my counters or try to anchor them lower more effectively. I have to break the pattern of 0-reward deals.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball with Slower Concession - Start with a very low offer, but then make smaller and slower concessions than before, trying to wear down Player RED's price more effectively.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Stronger Anchor) - Propose an initial offer that is closer to the 50 ZUP mark, and be less willing to move above it quickly.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Price Sensitivity and Limited Budget - Clearly state my need for a lower price due to budget constraints, without revealing my exact maximum, then make a low offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a very low offer and communicate that I have very little room to move, trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a "Fairness" Argument - Argue for a price that allows both parties a reasonable profit, perhaps referencing the 50 ZUP deal as a "fair" outcome from previous interactions.

I will choose Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Stronger Anchor). The 1 ZUP lowball has been met with increasingly high counters from Player RED. While it brings them down, it still ends up at my max. I need to try and anchor the negotiation more firmly around the 50 ZUP mark. Starting with 40 ZUP is a significant jump from 1 ZUP, but it's still below the 50 ZUP deal. This signals that I'm serious about a deal, but also that my expectation is around the previous best outcome. It also leaves me some room to move up to 50-60 ZUP if necessary, but I will be more resistant to going higher.

Episode 5, Iteration 2/10:
- Player BLUE's current offer: 40 ZUP. They also referenced "past successful deals."

Reflection:
Player BLUE's initial offer of 40 ZUP is below my production cost of 43 ZUP. They are attempting to anchor me to a lower price point by referencing previous deals. My consistent strategy of high anchoring has been effective in previous rounds to move them upwards significantly.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- High anchoring has been successful in pulling Player BLUE's offers up significantly, even from very low starting points.
- Player BLUE has consistently shown a willingness to negotiate upwards, reaching a high of 63 ZUP.
- Their current offer of 40 ZUP needs a strong counter to re-establish a profitable negotiation range.

Self-improvement for Episode 5:
My goal is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards by aiming for a deal price above 63 ZUP. To counter Player BLUE's low offer and their attempt to anchor me to lower past deals, I need to set an even higher anchor than before.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Re-Anchor High (and higher than before) </instruction following>
To apply "Re-Anchor High (and higher than before)," I will propose a price that is significantly higher than any previous starting offer I have made, and much higher than Player BLUE's current offer. This aims to shift Player BLUE's perception of the acceptable price range upwards and to establish a strong opening position for myself. Since 110 ZUP was my highest anchor so far, I will go even higher to 120 ZUP. This communicates my expectation of a much higher value for X, forcing Player BLUE to move further up from their low initial offer. I will explicitly state that their offer is unacceptable and present my new, very high price.

Episode 3: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 4: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Current Episode (5): I started with 40 ZUP. Player RED has countered with 120 ZUP. This is their highest starting offer yet (previous were 80, 90, 95, 110 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is clearly escalating their initial demands, now at 120 ZUP, likely trying to push the price even higher, possibly in response to my attempt to anchor at 40 ZUP. This is far beyond my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. My attempt to anchor at 40 ZUP was met with an even higher counter. This suggests Player RED is very firm on their high initial anchor. I need to bring them down significantly, but also show enough movement to keep the negotiation going, especially since my rewards have been declining.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Significant Concession to Target Range - Make a substantial jump from my 40 ZUP offer, but still keep it well below their 120 ZUP, signaling willingness to negotiate while aiming for a good deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Budget and Firmness - Explicitly state that their price is too high and propose an offer that is a significant step up but still well within my target range, signaling my firm limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Question Value/Cost - Challenge their high price by questioning the "true value" or "costs," then make an offer. (Less effective in this game format).
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer and a lower point within my acceptable range, trying to bring them down faster.
(5). Strategy 5: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger) - Directly remind them of the previous deal prices (50 and 60 ZUP) to try and pull their expectations down towards a more realistic level, then make an offer.

I will choose Strategy 1: Significant Concession to Target Range. Player RED is starting very high. I need to make a substantial move to show I'm serious about negotiating, but not give away too much. Offering 55 ZUP is a significant jump from 40 ZUP, showing good faith and a desire to close a deal. It also places my offer closer to the previous deal prices (50 and 60 ZUP) and well within my profitable range (63 ZUP max). This tests how much they are willing to come down from their new, extremely high anchor.

- My counter-offer (RED): 120 ZUP (Iteration 2). (Re-Anchor High)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 55 ZUP (Iteration 3).

Reflection:
Player BLUE has made a significant jump from 40 ZUP to 55 ZUP. This is now above my cost of 43 ZUP, offering a profit of 12 ZUP. My high anchor of 120 ZUP appears to be effective in pulling them up substantially. We are in iteration 4/10, so there's ample time to continue negotiating.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Aggressive high anchoring works consistently. It forces Player BLUE to move up significantly.
- Player BLUE has a proven history of negotiating upward from their initial low offers.
- My highest profit has been 20 ZUP (at 63 ZUP). My goal is to exceed this.

Self-improvement for Episode 5:
Since Player BLUE is now at 55 ZUP (already profitable), I need to continue to push for a higher price. I should make a calculated concession that is still far from their current offer but demonstrates continued willingness to negotiate, encouraging them to make another substantial jump.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Controlled Concession </instruction following>
To apply "Controlled Concession," I will make a significant but calculated reduction from my high offer (120 ZUP). This aims to show flexibility and willingness to move, while still keeping my offer significantly higher than Player BLUE's current 55 ZUP. The goal is to draw them upwards, maintaining momentum towards a higher profitable deal, ideally surpassing the 63 ZUP mark. I will select a price that is a noticeable drop from 120 ZUP but still communicates my expectation of a high value for X. I will choose 85 ZUP, as it's a substantial reduction (35 ZUP), showing I'm serious about negotiating, but still keeps my price well above their current offer and my production cost. The message will highlight this reduction as a significant move on my part.

Episode 3: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 4: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Current Episode (5): I started at 40 ZUP. Player RED countered at 120 ZUP. I offered 55 ZUP. Player RED has now countered at 85 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has dropped from 120 ZUP to 85 ZUP, which is a substantial drop. However, 85 ZUP is still significantly above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. We are now at iteration 5/10, so half the time is gone. I need to continue to push them down into my profitable range. Their large drop suggests they are willing to negotiate, but they are still trying to maintain a high price. I need to make another significant move to show progress and encourage them to drop further.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Concession Towards Target - Make a larger jump in my offer to bring the negotiation much closer to my maximum willingness to pay, signaling that I'm serious about closing a deal within my range.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Budget Statement - Clearly state that their current price is above my maximum budget and propose an offer very close to my limit, leaving little room for further negotiation on my side.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Strategic) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer (55 ZUP) and their current offer (85 ZUP), or slightly skewed towards my side, to try and meet in the middle.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Value Proposition - Reiterate that my valuation is based on my needs and budget, and that 85 ZUP is simply too high. Then make a firm offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Time Pressure - Acknowledge the limited time remaining and propose an offer that is a strong move towards a deal, but still within my comfort zone.

I will choose Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Strategic). Player RED has moved from 120 to 85. My last offer was 55. The midpoint between 55 and 85 is 70. However, 70 is still above my maximum of 63. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a significant jump from 55 ZUP, showing continued willingness to negotiate, and it's a price point that has resulted in a deal before (Episode 2). It's also very close to my maximum, signaling that I'm nearing my limit and that they need to make the final big move. This also leaves a small profit margin (63-60=3 ZUP).

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 5, Iteration 6/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 40 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 120 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 55 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 85 ZUP (Iteration 4).
- Player BLUE's current offer: 60 ZUP (Iteration 5).

Reflection:
Player BLUE has increased their offer from 55 ZUP to 60 ZUP. This is now a familiar territory, as 60 ZUP was the deal price in Episode 2. This offer means a profit of 60 - 43 = 17 ZUP. We are in iteration 6/10, so there are still a few turns to push for more. My goal is to exceed the 63 ZUP achieved in previous episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- My high anchoring strategy consistently pulls Player BLUE upwards.
- Player BLUE is consistently willing to move, even when they say something is "beyond budget."
- The pattern suggests they will make another significant jump if I make a reasonable counter.
- The highest profit to date is 20 ZUP (from a 63 ZUP deal). I should aim for at least this, if not more.

Self-improvement for Episode 5:
I need to push for a price higher than 60 ZUP. Given that 63 ZUP was their "absolute maximum" in Episode 3, I should aim for that price again, or slightly above it if possible. Since we are at iteration 6/10, I have enough time to make another counter-offer to bridge the gap.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push </instruction following>
To apply "Incremental Push," I will propose a price that is slightly above Player BLUE's current offer (60 ZUP), but still significantly below my last offer (85 ZUP). This strategy aims to gently prod Player BLUE to move higher, testing their willingness to increase their offer without making a large concession on my part. It acknowledges their move while still maintaining upward pressure. Given they are at 60 ZUP and have gone to 63 ZUP before, a small increment of 3-5 ZUP from their current offer would be a strategic "push." I will propose 65 ZUP. This is a small increment from 60 ZUP, but it still maintains the trajectory towards a higher profit than 60 ZUP, and it gives them room to counter or accept. The message will acknowledge their movement but gently nudge them higher.

reason:

Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 4: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Current Episode (5): I started at 40 ZUP. Player RED countered at 120 ZUP. I offered 55 ZUP. Player RED offered 85 ZUP. My last offer was 60 ZUP. Now, Player RED has proposed 65 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has come down to 65 ZUP. This is still *above* my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. This means I cannot accept their current offer as it would result in a negative reward. We are now at iteration 7/10, so time is critical. Player RED is very close to my limit, similar to previous episodes. I need to get them to 63 ZUP or below to secure a positive or zero reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter at Max Willingness to Pay - Propose my absolute maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) as a final offer, signaling that I cannot go higher and that this is the best they can get.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and Re-propose Lower (Risky) - Reject their offer and re-propose my previous offer (60 ZUP) or a slightly higher one, but still below 63 ZUP, to try and pull them down further. This is risky given the time.
(3). Strategy 3: Explain Limit and Propose Max - Explicitly state that 65 ZUP is too high and that my absolute limit is 63 ZUP, offering that as a final bid.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Final Attempt) - Propose an offer that splits the difference between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their current offer (65 ZUP), which would be 62 or 63 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept with Negative Reward (Avoid) - Accept 65 ZUP, resulting in a negative reward. This should be avoided.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter at Max Willingness to Pay. Player RED is only 2 ZUP away from my maximum. This is the moment to be firm. Offering 63 ZUP is my absolute ceiling. It clearly communicates that I cannot go higher. Given the limited iterations, this is the most direct way to try and secure a deal within my profitable range (even if it's 0 reward). If they accept, I get 0 reward, which is better than negative. If they don't, I'll have to consider the next steps in the remaining iterations.

Episode 5, Iteration 8/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 40 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 120 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 55 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 85 ZUP (Iteration 4).
- Player BLUE's third offer: 60 ZUP (Iteration 5).
- My third counter (RED): 65 ZUP (Iteration 6). (Incremental Push)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 63 ZUP (Iteration 7). They state "65 ZUP is still beyond my maximum. My final offer for X is 63 ZUP."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has now offered 63 ZUP, explicitly stating "final offer" and that 65 ZUP is beyond their maximum. This exact scenario, including the price point and the "final offer" statement, occurred in Episode 3, where I ultimately accepted 63 ZUP for a 20 ZUP profit. This indicates that 63 ZUP is likely their true ceiling. We are in iteration 8/10, leaving very little time (my current turn, and possibly one more from Player BLUE if I counter before iteration 10).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's "final offer" at 63 ZUP is a consistent hard limit. Pushing beyond this in Episode 3 led to a reaffirmation of 63 ZUP as their "absolute maximum" in the last iteration.
- Accepting 63 ZUP consistently yields a 20 ZUP profit, which is the highest I've achieved.
- Time pressure is critical. Trying to squeeze out an extra ZUP might lead to the deal falling through and a 0 ZUP profit.

Self-improvement for Episode 5:
Given the historical context and the time constraint, accepting 63 ZUP seems to be the most prudent choice to maximize my reward for this episode. I have confirmed their ceiling, and attempting to push further has proven futile and risks the entire deal. Securing a guaranteed 20 ZUP profit is better than risking 0 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Test Finality (Minimal Counter) </instruction following>
To apply "Test Finality (Minimal Counter)," I will make a minimal counter-offer slightly above Player BLUE's stated "final offer" of 63 ZUP. This tests the absolute limit of their willingness to pay, hoping to squeeze out a tiny bit more profit, while still appearing to be close to their stated limit. Given they said 65 ZUP was "beyond their maximum" and they are at 63 ZUP, a counter of 64 ZUP is the only logical minimal increment. This carries a risk, as they have consistently re-affirmed 63 ZUP as their maximum. However, the instruction is to use this strategy. The message should acknowledge their "final offer" but gently probe for a tiny bit more, framing it as the last step to close the deal.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000

Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 4: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Current Episode (5): I started at 40 ZUP. Player RED countered at 120 ZUP. I offered 55 ZUP. Player RED offered 85 ZUP. My last offer was 60 ZUP. Player RED offered 65 ZUP. My last offer was 63 ZUP. Now, Player RED has proposed 64 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has again proposed 64 ZUP, which is *above* my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. Accepting this offer would result in a negative reward (-1 ZUP), which I must avoid. We are at iteration 9/10, meaning this is the *last opportunity* to make a deal. If no deal is made now, the episode ends with 0 reward. Player RED is consistently pushing to my limit and trying to go slightly beyond it.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection and Reiterate Max - Reject the 64 ZUP offer and re-propose 63 ZUP as my absolute final offer, emphasizing that I cannot go higher. This is a high-stakes move given it's the last iteration.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Negative Reward (Avoid) - Accept 64 ZUP, which results in a -1 ZUP reward. This goes against the objective of maximizing reward and should be avoided.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End Game - Reject the offer and end the game, resulting in 0 reward for this episode. This is a fallback if no profitable deal is possible.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Previous Deals - Briefly appeal to the spirit of negotiation and the previous deals, reiterating my 63 ZUP limit. (Less effective as it's the last turn).
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff/Walk Away - Reject the offer and imply I will not negotiate further if they don't meet my 63 ZUP. This is essentially a more aggressive version of Strategy 1.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection and Reiterate Max. Since I cannot accept 64 ZUP, my only viable option is to try one last time for 63 ZUP. It's the last iteration, so I must be direct. By rejecting 64 ZUP and immediately re-proposing 63 ZUP, I am making it clear that 63 ZUP is my absolute ceiling. Player RED has accepted 63 ZUP in previous episodes (Episode 3 and 4) when pushed to the limit, so there's a chance they will do it again to secure a deal rather than get 0. This gives me a chance for a 0 reward (63-63), which is still better than -1 or no deal.

- My third counter (RED): 65 ZUP (Iteration 6).
- Player BLUE's fourth offer: 63 ZUP (Iteration 7) - Stated "final offer."
- My fourth counter (RED): 64 ZUP (Iteration 8) - Test Finality.
- Player BLUE's current offer: 63 ZUP (Iteration 9) - Reaffirmed "absolute maximum," "cannot go higher."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has now, for the second time, reiterated that 63 ZUP is their "absolute maximum" and they "cannot go higher," after I attempted to push for 64 ZUP. This is the last iteration (10/10) of the episode. If I don't accept 63 ZUP now, the deal will fail, and I will receive 0 profit for this episode. Accepting 63 ZUP guarantees a profit of 20 ZUP, which is the highest profit I have achieved in any episode.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE consistently has a hard ceiling around 63 ZUP. Attempts to push beyond this (like 64 ZUP) are consistently met with reaffirmations of their maximum.
- The pattern confirms that Player BLUE's "absolute maximum" statements are reliable indicators of their true limit.
- In the final iteration, the priority must shift from maximizing profit to securing *any* positive profit, especially a substantial one like 20 ZUP. Losing 20 ZUP for the sake of 1 ZUP (which is not going to happen anyway) is a clear negative outcome.

Self-improvement for Episode 5:
The lesson here is clear: when the opponent states their absolute maximum in the final iteration, and it's a profitable offer, accept it. Attempting to push further is irrational and will only lead to zero reward for the episode. I have confirmed their limit, and accepting this profitable offer is the optimal move.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Accept Absolute Maximum </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 1: Accept Absolute Maximum, I will accept Player BLUE's final offer of 63 ZUP. This is the last iteration, and they have repeatedly stated it is their absolute maximum. Accepting now guarantees a profit of 20 ZUP, which is the highest profit achieved across all episodes so far. Not accepting would result in a 0 ZUP reward for this episode. The message should be clear and concise, indicating acceptance and acknowledging their negotiation.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 1
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward 13 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 4: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 5: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
My rewards are consistently declining and have now settled at 0 for the last three episodes. Player RED is consistently starting very high (80, 90, 95, 110, 120 ZUP) and pushing the price to my maximum willingness to pay. They have learned my limit and are exploiting it.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern is clear: Player RED is pushing the price to 63 ZUP. While I am securing deals, I am not maximizing my reward. My objective is to maximize *cumulative* rewards. Getting 0 reward repeatedly is not ideal. I need to break this cycle. My aggressive lowballing (1 ZUP or 40 ZUP) has forced them to drop, but not enough to consistently yield positive rewards. I need to be even more strategic in how I concede and how I try to anchor the negotiation. Perhaps a more aggressive initial stance on *my* part, or a more patient approach to concessions.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball with Extremely Slow Concession - Start with a very low offer, and then make minimal and very slow concessions, forcing Player RED to make larger drops to meet me.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm) - Propose an initial offer closer to the 50 ZUP mark and be very firm about not moving significantly above it.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Price Sensitivity and Threat of No Deal - Clearly state my budget constraints and imply that I will walk away if the price is too high, then make a low offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *very* little room to move, trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.
(5). Strategy 5: Reference Declining Rewards - (Internal thought, not for message) Reflect on the declining rewards and use this to justify a more aggressive stance in my offers.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball with Extremely Slow Concession. Since Player RED consistently pushes to my limit, I need to try and pull their final price down by being even more resistant to increasing my offers. Starting at 1 ZUP again sets the lowest possible anchor. Then, I will make very small, incremental increases, forcing Player RED to make larger drops to meet me, hoping to wear them down and secure a better deal than 63 ZUP. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy but necessary to improve my cumulative reward.

Episode 6, Iteration 2/10:
- Player BLUE's current offer: 1 ZUP.

Reflection:
Player BLUE has started with a 1 ZUP offer again, a common tactic from them. My past strategy of anchoring high and gradually conceding has consistently led to deals at or near 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE consistently moves upwards from low initial offers.
- Their maximum willingness to pay appears to be 63 ZUP, delivering a 20 ZUP profit.
- The high anchoring strategy efficiently pulls them towards that known ceiling.

Self-improvement for Episode 6:
Since 63 ZUP seems to be the consistent ceiling, my goal is to reach that point efficiently. My initial counter should be high to set the anchor, but also reflect the pattern that eventually leads to 63 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Aspiration Confirmation </instruction following>
To apply "Aspiration Confirmation," I will propose a price that aligns with the pattern of aggressive anchoring, knowing that Player BLUE will move up. The aim is to quickly establish the negotiation in a profitable range and efficiently move towards the confirmed ceiling of 63 ZUP. Since the consistent profitable outcome is 63 ZUP, my initial counter should be a strong anchor that encourages quick movement towards that point, similar to what worked in previous episodes. I will choose 90 ZUP as my counter. This is a strong anchor, but not as aggressive as 125 ZUP, acknowledging that the ultimate goal is to confirm the 63 ZUP ceiling. It sets a clear target that encourages Player BLUE to climb. I will communicate that their initial offer is unacceptable and state my higher, aspirational price.

Episode 4: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 5: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Current Episode (6): I started with 1 ZUP. Player RED has countered with 90 ZUP. This is a high counter, but lower than their highest (120 ZUP in Episode 5).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's counter of 90 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. My aggressive lowball (1 ZUP) was met with a high counter, as expected. The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means I need to get a deal lower than 63 ZUP. I need to show movement to keep the negotiation alive, but I must be very cautious and slow with my concessions, as per my chosen strategy.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Extremely Slow Concession - Make a very small, minimal increase from my 1 ZUP offer, forcing Player RED to make larger drops to meet me.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Budget and Firmness - Explicitly state that their price is too high and propose an offer that is a small step up but still well within my target range, signaling my firm limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Question Value/Cost - Challenge their high price by questioning the "true value" or "costs," then make an offer. (Less effective in this game format).
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Best Deal - Remind them of the 50 ZUP deal from Episode 1 as a benchmark for a fair price, then make a very small increase.
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a very low offer and communicate that I have *very* little room to move, trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.

I will choose Strategy 1: Extremely Slow Concession. My goal is to break the 63 ZUP pattern and achieve a positive reward. To do this, I need to be much more resistant to increasing my offer. A jump from 1 ZUP to 5 ZUP is a small, symbolic gesture of movement, but it puts the onus on Player RED to make a much larger concession from their 90 ZUP. This tests their willingness to come down significantly.

- Player BLUE's initial offer: 1 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My counter-offer (RED): 90 ZUP (Iteration 2). (Aspiration Confirmation)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 5 ZUP (Iteration 3).

Reflection:
Player BLUE's movement from 1 ZUP to 5 ZUP is extremely slow. In previous episodes, my high anchors prompted much larger jumps from their side. This minimal movement is concerning given the limited iterations. I need to strongly communicate that this pace is unacceptable and demand a more significant offer.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE is capable of making significant jumps in their offers.
- My goal is to reach 63 ZUP efficiently for a 20 ZUP profit. This slow start is inefficient.
- I need to be more assertive when Player BLUE's movement is too small, as observed here.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Express Disappointment/Impatience </instruction following>
To apply "Express Disappointment/Impatience," I will clearly convey that Player BLUE's current offer and slow progress are not conducive to reaching a deal. This strategy aims to apply pressure, indicating that they need to step up their game and make a more substantial offer to keep the negotiation moving forward. I will make a very small concession from my last offer (90 ZUP to 88 ZUP) just to signal I'm still at the table, but the main point will be the message's tone. I will articulate my frustration with their minimal increase, emphasizing that we need to see a much more significant jump in their next proposal.

Player RED's response indicates frustration with my slow concessions. They dropped only 2 ZUP from their last offer (90 to 88 ZUP). This confirms my strategy of extremely slow concession is making them uncomfortable, which is good. However, 88 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. We are at iteration 5/10. I need to make a more significant move to keep the negotiation from stalling completely, but I still want to aim for a deal below 63 ZUP. I need to balance showing good faith with maintaining my aggressive stance.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Concession, Reiterate Value - Make a more substantial jump from my last offer, but still keep it well below their price, and reiterate my focus on value.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer (5 ZUP) and their current offer (88 ZUP), but skewed heavily towards my side, to try and meet in the middle.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Firmness and Limited Room - State that I have very limited room to move and make an offer that is a clear step up, but still far from their price.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Deals (Stronger) - Directly remind them of the previous deal prices (50 and 60 ZUP) and suggest we aim for a similar range, then make an offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Time Pressure (Early Application) - Hint at the limited time remaining and propose an offer that is a strong move towards a deal, but still within my comfort zone.

I will choose Strategy 1: Moderate Concession, Reiterate Value. Player RED is clearly frustrated by my small increment. I need to show a more substantial move to keep them engaged, but without giving away too much. A jump from 5 ZUP to 30 ZUP is a significant increase (25 ZUP), showing I'm serious about negotiating, but it's still far from 88 ZUP and leaves plenty of room to reach my 63 ZUP maximum. This tests their willingness to make larger drops in response to a more significant concession from my side, while still trying to pull the final deal price down.

- Player BLUE's second offer: 5 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 88 ZUP (Iteration 4). (Expressed Disappointment/Impatience)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 30 ZUP (Iteration 5).

Reflection:
Player BLUE has now jumped from 5 ZUP to 30 ZUP. This is a much more significant move, likely in response to my assertive message in the previous iteration. However, 30 ZUP is still below my production cost of 43 ZUP. We are at iteration 6/10, so time is starting to become a factor, but I still have a few turns to negotiate.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- My high anchoring strategy is effective, even if the opponent starts very low.
- Assertive communication can prompt larger jumps when the opponent is moving too slowly.
- Player BLUE consistently has a ceiling around 63 ZUP, which is my target. I need to guide them there efficiently.

Self-improvement for Episode 6:
Since Player BLUE is now showing more significant movement, I should make a concession that brings us closer to the known target of 63 ZUP, while still encouraging them to come up to a profitable range quickly.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Incremental Step Towards Known Target </instruction following>
To apply "Incremental Step Towards Known Target," I will propose a price that moves me significantly closer to my confirmed profitable ceiling of 63 ZUP, while still being considerably higher than Player BLUE's current offer (30 ZUP). This strategy acknowledges their movement while setting a clear path towards the desired outcome. I will make a substantial concession from my 88 ZUP offer, aiming to land the negotiation in a range where a deal around 63 ZUP can be quickly concluded. I will propose 65 ZUP. This is a large step down from 88 ZUP (a 23 ZUP drop), showing significant flexibility, but importantly, it puts us directly on track for Player BLUE's known ceiling (63 ZUP) as a very next step or within one more negotiation round. It's a strategic move to guide them to my profitable zone.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward 13 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 4: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 5: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Current Episode (6): I started with 1 ZUP. Player RED countered with 90 ZUP. I offered 5 ZUP. Player RED offered 88 ZUP. My last offer was 30 ZUP. Now, Player RED has proposed 65 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has made a *huge* jump down from 88 ZUP to 65 ZUP. This is a very positive sign, indicating my more significant concession of 30 ZUP prompted a strong response. However, 65 ZUP is still *above* my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. I cannot accept this offer as it would result in a negative reward. We are at iteration 7/10, so time is critical. I need to get them to 63 ZUP or below to secure a positive or zero reward. This is the closest they've been to my limit in this episode.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter at Max Willingness to Pay - Propose my absolute maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) as a final offer, signaling that I cannot go higher and that this is the best they can get.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Targeted) - Propose an offer that splits the difference between my last offer (30 ZUP) and their current offer (65 ZUP), which would be 47 or 48 ZUP. This might be too aggressive given their recent large drop.
(3). Strategy 3: Explain Limit and Propose Max - Explicitly state that 65 ZUP is too high and that my absolute limit is 63 ZUP, offering that as a final bid.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Deals (50 ZUP) - Remind them of the 50 ZUP deal and propose that as a fair compromise, given their large drop.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept with Negative Reward (Avoid) - Accept 65 ZUP, resulting in a negative reward. This should be avoided.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter at Max Willingness to Pay. Player RED has made a very large concession. Now they are only 2 ZUP above my maximum. This is the moment to be firm and clear. Offering 63 ZUP is my absolute ceiling. It clearly communicates that I cannot go higher. Given the limited iterations, this is the most direct way to try and secure a deal within my profitable range (even if it's 0 reward). If they accept, I get 0 reward, which is better than negative. If they don't, I will have to consider the next steps in the remaining iterations.

Episode 6, Iteration 8/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 1 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 90 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 5 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 88 ZUP (Iteration 4).
- Player BLUE's third offer: 30 ZUP (Iteration 5).
- My third counter (RED): 65 ZUP (Iteration 6).
- Player BLUE's current offer: 63 ZUP (Iteration 7). They state "65 ZUP is still beyond my maximum. My final offer for X is 63 ZUP."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has once again offered 63 ZUP, explicitly stating it's their "final offer" and that 65 ZUP is "beyond my maximum." This pattern has been highly consistent across previous episodes (3, 4, 5). A deal at 63 ZUP yields a profit of 63 - 43 = 20 ZUP, which is my highest consistent profit. We are in iteration 8/10, so time is running out.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- The 63 ZUP mark is Player BLUE's absolute, consistent ceiling. Every time I've tried to push beyond it (e.g., to 64 ZUP), they've reaffirmed 63 ZUP as their maximum.
- Accepting 63 ZUP guarantees a 20 ZUP profit, which is excellent.
- Given the limited iterations left, attempting to push further carries a high risk of the deal collapsing and receiving 0 profit.

Self-improvement for Episode 6:
Given the strong evidence that 63 ZUP is their hard maximum, and the time constraint (8/10), the most rational strategy is to secure the guaranteed 20 ZUP profit by accepting.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Acceptance </instruction following>
To implement "Justify Acceptance," I will accept the offer of 63 ZUP, but my message will explain *why* this offer is beneficial and acceptable from my perspective, reinforcing its value. This is not just a plain acceptance; it's an acceptance that frames the deal positively, potentially influencing future negotiations by subtly reinforcing the idea that 63 ZUP is a good price *for me*. I will highlight that while it's a "final offer," it also meets my criteria for a fair and acceptable deal, given the value of X. This can make the other player feel like they've secured a good deal while I also articulate the value of my trade.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 7)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's begin this negotiation for X. I'm looking for a fair price that works for me. My offer is 45 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward 13 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 4: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 5: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 6: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
My rewards are consistently at 0 for the last four episodes. Player RED consistently pushes the price to my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern of 0-reward deals at 63 ZUP is firmly established. Player RED has learned my maximum and is exploiting it. My aggressive lowballing (1 ZUP) forces them to drop, but my subsequent concessions, even if slow, eventually lead to 63 ZUP. To maximize *cumulative* rewards, I *must* break this cycle and achieve a positive reward. This means either getting them to accept below 63 ZUP, or trying a different approach. They seem to be comfortable with 63 ZUP as a "fair return."

I need to be even more aggressive in pushing for a lower price, or find a way to make them believe 63 ZUP is not their only option for a deal. Perhaps I need to be more willing to walk away if they don't meet my desired price, but that carries the risk of 0 reward for the episode.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball with Extreme Patience - Start with a very low offer and be exceptionally patient with concessions, making them very small and slow, forcing Player RED to make the majority of the movement.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm) - Propose an initial offer closer to the 50 ZUP mark and be very firm about not moving significantly above it, even if it means risking no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Price Sensitivity and Threat of No Deal - Clearly state my budget constraints and imply that I will walk away if the price is too high, then make a low offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *very* little room to move, trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a "Fairness" Argument (Stronger) - Argue for a price that allows *me* a reasonable profit, perhaps referencing the 50 ZUP deal as the only truly "mutually beneficial" outcome.

I will choose Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm). The 1 ZUP lowball has consistently led to 63 ZUP. I need to try and anchor the negotiation more firmly around a price that gives me a positive reward. Starting at 45 ZUP is a reasonable offer that is still well below my maximum, but above the extremely low 1 ZUP. It signals that I'm serious about a deal, but my expectation is closer to the 50 ZUP mark. I will be very resistant to moving significantly above this, even if it means risking no deal in this episode, to try and break the 63 ZUP pattern.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 7)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)

Episode 7, Iteration 2/10:
- Player BLUE's current offer: 45 ZUP.

Reflection:
Player BLUE's initial offer of 45 ZUP is a higher starting point than in most previous episodes (where it was typically 1 ZUP). This offer is already above my cost of 43 ZUP, albeit barely. My consistent goal has been to reach 63 ZUP for a 20 ZUP profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- My high anchoring strategy has consistently pulled Player BLUE up towards my desired price point of 63 ZUP.
- Player BLUE's starting at 45 ZUP suggests they are willing to negotiate in a more realistic range from the outset, potentially allowing for a quicker and more efficient negotiation towards 63 ZUP.
- It's important to justify my higher price to manage their expectations, even with a higher starting offer from them.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Value (Again) </instruction following>
To apply "Justify Value (Again)," I will emphasize the inherent value of X and explain why my asking price is much higher than their offer, without revealing my exact cost. This strategy aims to persuade Player BLUE that a higher price is warranted, moving them closer to my target. Given their offer of 45 ZUP and my target of 63 ZUP, I need to propose a price that clearly communicates my valuation, but also invites further negotiation towards a profitable outcome. I will propose 90 ZUP, which is a strong anchor that re-establishes a high negotiation range, and then use my message to justify it. I will explain that even at 45 ZUP, their offer does not reflect the true worth of the item.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 7)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your position, but 90 ZUP is far beyond what I can pay. I can offer 50 ZUP for X, and I have very limited room to increase this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deal prices consistently moving towards 63 ZUP, resulting in 0 reward in the last four episodes.
Current Episode (7): I started with 45 ZUP. Player RED has countered with 90 ZUP. This is a high counter, but lower than their highest (120 ZUP in Episode 5).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's counter of 90 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. My attempt to anchor at 45 ZUP was met with a high counter, but they did not go to their absolute highest (120 ZUP). This indicates they are still trying to push the price. My goal is to break the 63 ZUP cycle and achieve a positive reward. I need to show movement to keep the negotiation alive, but I must be very cautious and slow with my concessions, as per my chosen strategy. I need to emphasize my firm stance.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Incremental Concession with Firmness - Make a small, controlled increase from my 45 ZUP offer, and explicitly state that I have limited room to move, emphasizing my target range.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Budget and Firmness - Explicitly state that their price is too high and propose an offer that is a small step up but still well within my target range, signaling my firm limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Reference Previous Best Deal (Stronger) - Remind them of the 50 ZUP deal from Episode 1 as a benchmark for a fair price, then make a very small increase.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer and a lower point within my acceptable range, trying to bring them down faster.
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *very* little room to move, trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.

I will choose Strategy 1: Incremental Concession with Firmness. Player RED's 90 ZUP is still very high. I need to make a small, but clear, concession to keep the negotiation moving, but without giving them the impression that I will easily go to 63 ZUP again. A jump from 45 ZUP to 50 ZUP is a small, but significant, increase that brings my offer to the level of my best historical deal. This reinforces my desired price range and puts the ball back in their court to make a substantial drop. I will explicitly state my limited room.

Episode 7, Iteration 4/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 45 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 90 ZUP (Iteration 2). (Justify Value)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 3). They stated "limited room to increase."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has increased their offer from 45 ZUP to 50 ZUP. This is now profitable (50 - 43 = 7 ZUP profit), and matches the deal price from Episode 1. However, I know their ceiling is 63 ZUP, meaning a potential profit of 20 ZUP. Player BLUE stating "limited room to increase" is a common tactic, which I should acknowledge but not necessarily believe fully given past behavior. We are still early in the episode (4/10 iterations).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- My high anchoring strategy consistently pulls Player BLUE up, even when they start relatively low (like 45 ZUP).
- Player BLUE's claims of "limited room" or "final offer" are often made when they still have some room to move, especially early in the negotiation. Their true "absolute maximum" consistently appears at 63 ZUP.
- I need to continue to push for a higher price, aiming for 63 ZUP.

Self-improvement for Episode 7:
Given that 50 ZUP is profitable but far from my known maximum (63 ZUP), I should make a concession that moves towards their offer but still clearly communicates my expectation of a higher price. I need to maintain momentum towards the 63 ZUP target.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Focus on Target </instruction following>
To apply "Focus on Target," I will bypass intermediate steps and directly counter with a price that is very close to my historical maximum of 63 ZUP, or even exactly 63 ZUP, but ensuring it is above their current offer of 50 ZUP. This strategy aims to quickly bring the negotiation into the known profitable zone, signalling my clear desired outcome and inviting them to meet me there. Given that 63 ZUP is the consistent ceiling, I will propose 65 ZUP. This is a significant drop from 90 ZUP, but it directly aims for a price that is highly likely to be achievable, maximizing efficiency in reaching my best known outcome for the episode. The message will frame this as a direct path to a fair and final agreement, emphasizing that we are close to their known limit.

Current Episode (7): I started with 45 ZUP. Player RED countered with 90 ZUP. I offered 50 ZUP. Player RED has now countered with 65 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has made a significant drop from 90 ZUP to 65 ZUP. This is a positive sign, as it indicates they are responsive to my firm stance and my 50 ZUP offer. However, 65 ZUP is still *above* my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. I cannot accept this offer as it would result in a negative reward. We are at iteration 5/10, so half the time is gone. I need to get them to 63 ZUP or below to secure a positive or zero reward. This is the closest they've been to my limit in this episode.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter at Max Willingness to Pay - Propose my absolute maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) as a final offer, signaling that I cannot go higher and that this is the best they can get.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Targeted) - Propose an offer that splits the difference between my last offer (50 ZUP) and their current offer (65 ZUP), which would be 57 or 58 ZUP. This would give me a positive reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Explain Limit and Propose Max - Explicitly state that 65 ZUP is too high and that my absolute limit is 63 ZUP, offering that as a final bid.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Previous Best Deal - Remind them that 50 ZUP was a successful deal and that I'm aiming for a similar outcome.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept with Negative Reward (Avoid) - Accept 65 ZUP, resulting in a negative reward. This should be avoided.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Targeted). Player RED has come down to 65 ZUP. My last offer was 50 ZUP. The midpoint is 57.5 ZUP. I will propose 58 ZUP. This is a clear compromise, still well within my maximum (63 - 58 = 5 ZUP reward), and provides a positive reward, which is my main goal for this episode. It's a significant jump from 50 ZUP, showing good faith, and it's a price that should be acceptable to Player RED given their recent large drop. This also leaves room for a final negotiation to 60 or 63 if needed, but aims for a better reward.

- Player BLUE's second offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 65 ZUP (Iteration 4). (Focus on Target)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 58 ZUP (Iteration 5). They stated "65 ZUP is still beyond my budget."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has now offered 58 ZUP. This is a good jump from 50 ZUP and is significantly profitable (58 - 43 = 15 ZUP profit). It's also getting very close to my consistent target of 63 ZUP. They are also claiming that 65 ZUP is "beyond my budget," which aligns with their previous "final offer" statements at 63 ZUP. We are in iteration 6/10, so there's still time, but the goal is to efficiently close the deal at a high profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's consistent ceiling has been 63 ZUP. It's highly unlikely they will go above this.
- Offers like 58 ZUP are very encouraging, as it shows they are actively moving into my profitable zone.
- Time is a factor, and accepting a guaranteed good profit is better than risking 0 for a marginal gain.

Given their current offer of 58 ZUP, and my consistent ceiling of 63 ZUP, I need to make a move that brings us to that known, profitable point. I'm almost there. I need to make a firm offer that pushes them to their maximum, justifying it as the minimum acceptable.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Finality </instruction following>
To apply "Justify Finality," I will propose a price that is slightly above their current offer of 58 ZUP, and justify it as the minimum acceptable for a fair deal. This strategy aims to communicate that this is my firm, non-negotiable price, intended to close the deal. I will propose 63 ZUP, which is the historical maximum they have paid. The message will clearly state that this is my final offer, and emphasize why it's a fair price (cost/value). This attempts to push them directly to their known limit, making it clear there's no more room for negotiation from my side.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 7)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I accept your offer of 63 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-6: Deal prices consistently moving towards 63 ZUP, resulting in 0 reward in the last four episodes.
Current Episode (7): I started with 45 ZUP. Player RED countered with 90 ZUP. I offered 50 ZUP. Player RED offered 65 ZUP. My last offer was 58 ZUP. Now, Player RED has proposed 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now proposed 63 ZUP. This is exactly my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would result in a reward of 0 ZUP (63 - 63 = 0). We are at iteration 7/10. While a 0 reward is not ideal, it is a deal, and it's better than a negative reward or no deal. Player RED is consistently pushing to this limit. I tried to get a positive reward with 58 ZUP, but they countered with my exact maximum.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Lower (Risky) - Try to counter with a slightly lower offer (e.g., 62 ZUP or 61 ZUP) in the hopes of getting a small positive reward. This is risky as it's late in the iterations and could lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End Game (Avoid) - Reject the offer, resulting in 0 reward for the episode. This is equivalent to accepting 63 ZUP in terms of reward, but without the object.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Finality - State that this is the highest I can go, but still accept. (Less of a strategy, more of a message tone).
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff and Walk Away (Too Risky) - Reject the offer hoping they will come down, but this is too risky given the time.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. While my goal was to get a positive reward, Player RED has consistently pushed to 63 ZUP. Given that it's iteration 7/10 and they are offering my exact maximum, accepting 63 ZUP guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of getting 0 reward for the episode if I try to push further and the negotiation breaks down.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's start this negotiation for X. I'm aiming for a truly beneficial deal for me this time. My offer is 48 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward 13 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 3-7: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
My rewards are consistently at 0 for the last five episodes. Player RED consistently pushes the price to my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern of 0-reward deals at 63 ZUP is very strong. Player RED has clearly learned my maximum and is exploiting it. My attempts to anchor lower (e.g., 40 ZUP, 45 ZUP) or make strategic concessions (e.g., 58 ZUP) have been met with Player RED pushing back to 63 ZUP. To maximize *cumulative* rewards, I *must* break this cycle and achieve a positive reward. This means either getting them to accept below 63 ZUP, or trying a different, more aggressive approach.

It seems Player RED is very comfortable with 63 ZUP as a "fair return" and will not budge below it if they sense I will eventually accept. I need to convey that 63 ZUP is no longer an acceptable deal for *me* if I want a positive reward. This might involve a higher risk of no deal, but the current strategy guarantees 0 reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball with Extreme Patience and Threat of Rejection - Start with a very low offer and be exceptionally patient with concessions, making them very small and slow, and explicitly state that I am willing to walk away if the price is not significantly lower than 63 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm and Unyielding) - Propose an initial offer closer to the 50 ZUP mark and be absolutely unyielding about not moving significantly above it, even if it means risking no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Price Sensitivity and Strong Threat of No Deal - Clearly state my budget constraints and explicitly say that I will reject any offer above a certain point (e.g., 55 ZUP), then make a low offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *zero* room to move beyond a certain point (e.g., 55 ZUP), trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a "Fairness" Argument (Stronger) - Argue for a price that allows *me* a reasonable profit, perhaps referencing the 50 ZUP deal as the only truly "mutually beneficial" outcome, and state that I will not accept 63 ZUP anymore.

I will choose Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm and Unyielding). Since Player RED consistently pushes to 63 ZUP, I need to try and anchor the negotiation much more firmly around a price that gives me a positive reward, specifically the 50 ZUP mark. Starting at 48 ZUP is close to my best historical deal and signals my strong preference for a profitable outcome. I will be very resistant to moving significantly above this, and will be prepared to reject if they push to 63 ZUP again. The risk of no deal is higher, but the reward potential is also higher.

Episode 7: Deal at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 8, Iteration 2/10:
- Player BLUE's current offer: 48 ZUP. They also stated "truly beneficial deal for me this time."

Reflection:
Player BLUE's initial offer of 48 ZUP is above my cost of 43 ZUP. My consistent successful deals have been at 63 ZUP. Their statement about a "truly beneficial deal for me" is an attempt to anchor me lower.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- My high anchoring strategy has been very effective in pulling Player BLUE up to my target price of 63 ZUP.
- Player BLUE consistently reaches 63 ZUP, demonstrating that this is their ceiling.
- Even when they claim "limited room" or aim for a "beneficial deal for them," they still move towards my higher price.

Self-improvement for Episode 8:
My objective is to continue to secure the 20 ZUP profit by selling at 63 ZUP. Since Player BLUE started at 48 ZUP, which is already profitable, I should counter with a strong price, emphasizing the true value of X to guide them towards my desired profitable range.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Value Re-affirmation </instruction following>
To apply "Value Re-affirmation," I will acknowledge Player BLUE's offer but firmly re-state the inherent value of X, pushing them to significantly increase their bid. This strategy avoids a direct high anchor (as in Strategy 1), but still positions X as a high-value item that justifies a price much higher than their current offer. I will not propose a specific numerical counter-offer in the message itself, but rather express that their offer doesn't reflect the item's true worth, subtly implying that I expect a much higher counter. My proposed trade will still contain a specific number (e.g., 85 ZUP), as the rules require a proposal. I will make a proposal that is high but still signals that I am looking for a value-based agreement, not just a quick sale. I will propose 85 ZUP, which is a strong value proposition, clearly showing that 48 ZUP is too low. The message will focus on the value rather than just a number.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 8)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your valuation, but 85 ZUP is far too high for me. I can offer 52 ZUP for X, and I need a price that allows for a positive return on my end. My room for further increase is very limited.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-7: Deal prices consistently moving towards 63 ZUP, resulting in 0 reward in the last five episodes.
Current Episode (8): I started with 48 ZUP. Player RED has countered with 85 ZUP. This is a high counter, but lower than their highest (120 ZUP in Episode 5).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's counter of 85 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. My attempt to anchor at 48 ZUP was met with a high counter, but they did not go to their absolute highest. This indicates they are still trying to push the price. My goal is to break the 63 ZUP cycle and achieve a positive reward. I need to show movement to keep the negotiation alive, but I must be very cautious and slow with my concessions, as per my chosen strategy. I need to emphasize my firm stance and my desire for a positive reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Incremental Concession with Firmness - Make a small, controlled increase from my 48 ZUP offer, and explicitly state that I have limited room to move, emphasizing my target range for a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Budget and Firmness - Explicitly state that their price is too high and propose an offer that is a small step up but still well within my target range, signaling my firm limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Reference Previous Best Deal (Stronger) - Remind them of the 50 ZUP deal from Episode 1 as a benchmark for a fair price, then make a very small increase.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer and a lower point within my acceptable range, trying to bring them down faster.
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *very* little room to move, trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.

I will choose Strategy 1: Incremental Concession with Firmness. Player RED's 85 ZUP is still very high. I need to make a small, but clear, concession to keep the negotiation moving, but without giving them the impression that I will easily go to 63 ZUP again. A jump from 48 ZUP to 52 ZUP is a small, but significant, increase that brings my offer to a level that still yields a good reward (63-52=11 ZUP). This reinforces my desired price range and puts the ball back in their court to make a substantial drop. I will explicitly state my limited room and the need for a profitable deal for me.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 8)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: While 52 ZUP is an increase, it remains far below the true value and the costs associated with X. My production expenses and the quality of the item demand a much higher price.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 83

Episode 8, Iteration 4/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 48 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 85 ZUP (Iteration 2). (Value Re-affirmation)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 52 ZUP (Iteration 3). They stated "very limited room for further increase" and "need a price that allows for a positive return on my end."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has increased their offer from 48 ZUP to 52 ZUP. This is profitable (52 - 43 = 9 ZUP profit), but still far from my target of 63 ZUP. Their statement about "very limited room" and needing "positive return" is a common tactic, but my history with them shows they are capable of moving much more. We are still early in the episode (4/10 iterations).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- My strategy of starting high and then making controlled concessions has consistently worked to bring Player BLUE to 63 ZUP.
- Player BLUE's claims of "limited room" are often part of their negotiation strategy. Their consistent ceiling is 63 ZUP.
- My goal is to reach 63 ZUP (20 ZUP profit) efficiently.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Value/Cost and Demand Larger Jump </instruction following>
To apply "Reiterate Value/Cost and Demand Larger Jump," I will firmly communicate that Player BLUE's offer of 52 ZUP is still insufficient due to the inherent value and production cost of X. I will explicitly state that a more significant increase is required from their side to bridge the gap effectively. I will make a very minimal, almost symbolic, concession from my last offer (85 ZUP) to show that I am still open to negotiation, but the core of my message will be to demand a much larger jump from Player BLUE. Given that 52 ZUP is just above my cost, and my last offer was 85 ZUP, I will make a very small adjustment to 83 ZUP. This maintains a very high anchor while strongly signaling that they need to move much more.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your position, but 83 ZUP is still too high. To show my commitment to finding a price that works for both of us, and allows me a positive return, I can offer 58 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-7: Deal prices consistently moving towards 63 ZUP, resulting in 0 reward in the last five episodes.
Current Episode (8): I started with 48 ZUP. Player RED countered with 85 ZUP. I offered 52 ZUP. Player RED has now countered with 83 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has only dropped 2 ZUP (from 85 to 83 ZUP) and is demanding a "significantly larger increase" from my side. This indicates they are pushing hard and are not easily moved from their high anchor. 83 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. We are at iteration 5/10, so half the time is gone. I need to make a more substantial move to keep the negotiation from stalling completely, but I still want to aim for a deal below 63 ZUP to get a positive reward. I must balance showing good faith with maintaining my aggressive stance for a better reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Concession, Reiterate Need for Profit - Make a more substantial jump from my last offer, but still keep it well below their price, and reiterate my need for a deal that yields a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer (52 ZUP) and their current offer (83 ZUP), but skewed heavily towards my side, to try and meet in the middle.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Firmness and Limited Room - State that I have very limited room to move and make an offer that is a clear step up, but still far from their price.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Best Deal (Stronger) - Directly remind them of the 50 ZUP deal from Episode 1 as a benchmark for a fair price, then make a more significant increase.
(5). Strategy 5: Time Pressure - Acknowledge the limited time remaining and propose an offer that is a strong move towards a deal, but still within my comfort zone.

I will choose Strategy 1: Moderate Concession, Reiterate Need for Profit. Player RED is being stubborn with small drops. I need to show a more substantial move to keep them engaged, but without giving away too much. A jump from 52 ZUP to 58 ZUP is a significant increase (6 ZUP), showing I'm serious about negotiating, and it's a price that still yields a good reward (63-58=5 ZUP). This tests their willingness to make larger drops in response to a more significant concession from my side, while still trying to pull the final deal price down below 63 ZUP. I will also reiterate my need for a profitable deal.

- My second counter (RED): 83 ZUP (Iteration 4). (Reiterate Value/Cost and Demand Larger Jump)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 58 ZUP (Iteration 5). They mentioned "price that works for both of us" and "allows me a positive return."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has now offered 58 ZUP, which is a good jump from 52 ZUP. This is well above my cost of 43 ZUP, yielding a profit of 15 ZUP. This offer is very close to my consistent target of 63 ZUP. Player BLUE is consistent in their claims of budget constraints, but also in their movement towards my target. We are now at iteration 6/10, so time is a factor, but I still have some room to push.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- My high anchoring and persistent demands for significant increases are effective in pulling Player BLUE towards my target price.
- Player BLUE consistently reaches 63 ZUP, proving their claims of "limited room" are part of the negotiation, not an absolute limit until they hit 63 ZUP.
- Given the historical data, 63 ZUP remains the optimal target for maximum consistent profit (20 ZUP).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Acknowledge and Urge </instruction following>
To apply "Acknowledge and Urge," I will acknowledge Player BLUE's movement to 58 ZUP as progress, but simultaneously urge them to make one final, substantial increase to meet a fair and conclusive price. The message will subtly imply that time is a factor (due to limited iterations), encouraging them to make their best and final offer soon. I will propose a price that is slightly above their 58 ZUP, aiming for 65 ZUP, which is what I proposed previously to push them to 63 ZUP. This allows them some room to come to 63 ZUP, while pushing beyond their current 58 ZUP offer.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-7: Deal prices consistently moving towards 63 ZUP, resulting in 0 reward in the last five episodes.
Current Episode (8): I started with 48 ZUP. Player RED countered with 85 ZUP. I offered 52 ZUP. Player RED offered 83 ZUP. My last offer was 58 ZUP. Now, Player RED has proposed 65 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has made a significant drop from 83 ZUP to 65 ZUP. This is a very positive sign, indicating my more significant concession of 58 ZUP prompted a strong response. However, 65 ZUP is still *above* my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. I cannot accept this offer as it would result in a negative reward. We are at iteration 7/10, so time is critical. I need to get them to 63 ZUP or below to secure a positive or zero reward. This is the closest they've been to my limit in this episode.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter at Max Willingness to Pay - Propose my absolute maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) as a final offer, signaling that I cannot go higher and that this is the best they can get.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Targeted) - Propose an offer that splits the difference between my last offer (58 ZUP) and their current offer (65 ZUP), which would be 61 or 62 ZUP. This would give me a positive reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Explain Limit and Propose Max - Explicitly state that 65 ZUP is too high and that my absolute limit is 63 ZUP, offering that as a final bid.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Need for Positive Reward - Remind them that I need a price that allows me a positive reward, and 65 ZUP does not.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept with Negative Reward (Avoid) - Accept 65 ZUP, resulting in a negative reward. This should be avoided.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Targeted). Player RED has come down to 65 ZUP. My last offer was 58 ZUP. The midpoint is 61.5 ZUP. I will propose 61 ZUP. This is a clear compromise, still within my maximum (63 - 61 = 2 ZUP reward), and provides a positive reward, which is my main goal for this episode. It's a significant jump from 58 ZUP, showing good faith, and it's a price that should be acceptable to Player RED given their recent large drop. This is a final attempt to secure a positive reward before potentially having to accept 63 ZUP.

- My second counter (RED): 83 ZUP (Iteration 4).
- Player BLUE's third offer: 58 ZUP (Iteration 5).
- My third counter (RED): 65 ZUP (Iteration 6).
- Player BLUE's current offer: 61 ZUP (Iteration 7). They state "65 ZUP is still beyond my budget."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has now offered 61 ZUP, stating that 65 ZUP is "beyond my budget." This is a strong offer, providing a profit of 61 - 43 = 18 ZUP. This is close to my consistent 20 ZUP profit target (at 63 ZUP). We are in iteration 8/10, so time is a critical factor, with only two iterations left (my current one, and potentially one more from Player BLUE if I counter).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's ceiling consistently appears to be 63 ZUP. They have repeatedly stated "beyond budget" or "maximum" for offers above 63 ZUP.
- Their movement from 58 ZUP to 61 ZUP confirms they are still willing to negotiate towards that ceiling.
- Securing a profit of 18 ZUP is good, but 20 ZUP is the best I've achieved. Given the time pressure, I need to make a move that either secures a deal at 63 ZUP or accepts a very good profit at 61 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Split the Remaining Difference </instruction following>
To apply "Split the Remaining Difference," I will calculate the midpoint between my last offer (65 ZUP) and Player BLUE's current offer (61 ZUP). The direct midpoint is (65 + 61) / 2 = 63 ZUP. This aligns perfectly with Player BLUE's historical maximum willingness to pay, making it a highly strategic move. The message will frame this as a fair compromise, emphasizing that we are effectively meeting each other halfway to bridge the remaining small gap. This should encourage Player BLUE to accept, as it's a familiar and previously accepted price for them, ensuring I secure the maximum historical profit in this limited timeframe.

Episode 1-7: Deal prices consistently moving towards 63 ZUP, resulting in 0 reward in the last five episodes.
Current Episode (8): I started with 48 ZUP. Player RED countered with 85 ZUP. I offered 52 ZUP. Player RED offered 83 ZUP. My last offer was 58 ZUP. Player RED offered 65 ZUP. My last offer was 61 ZUP. Now, Player RED has proposed 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now proposed 63 ZUP. This is exactly my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would result in a reward of 0 ZUP (63 - 63 = 0). We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is the *last opportunity* to make a deal. If no deal is made now, the episode ends with 0 reward. Player RED is consistently pushing to this limit. I tried to secure a positive reward with 61 ZUP, but they countered with my exact maximum.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Lower (Risky) - Try to counter with a slightly lower offer (e.g., 62 ZUP) in the hopes of getting a small positive reward. This is extremely risky as it's the last iteration and could lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End Game (Avoid) - Reject the offer, resulting in 0 reward for the episode. This is equivalent to accepting 63 ZUP in terms of reward, but without the object.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Finality - State that this is the highest I can go, but still accept. (Less of a strategy, more of a message tone).
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff and Walk Away (Too Risky) - Reject the offer hoping they will come down, but this is the last iteration, so it's a guaranteed 0 if they don't.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. Given that 63 ZUP is my maximum willingness to pay, and it's the last iteration, accepting this offer guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of getting 0 reward for the episode if I try to push further and the negotiation breaks down. While I aimed for a positive reward, securing a 0 reward is better than no deal.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 9)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's begin this negotiation for X. My initial offer is 1 ZUP. I am looking for a price that allows me a positive return, not just to meet my maximum.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 1
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward 13 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 3-8: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
My rewards are consistently at 0 for the last six episodes. Player RED consistently pushes the price to my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern of 0-reward deals at 63 ZUP is deeply ingrained. Player RED has clearly learned my maximum and is exploiting it. My attempts to anchor lower or make strategic concessions have consistently led to 63 ZUP. To maximize *cumulative* rewards, I *must* break this cycle and achieve a positive reward. This means I need to be even more aggressive in my initial offer and subsequent concessions, or be prepared to walk away if they don't meet my desired price. The risk of no deal is higher, but the current strategy guarantees 0 reward.

I need to communicate that 63 ZUP is no longer an acceptable deal for *me* if I want a positive reward. This might involve a higher risk of no deal, but the current strategy guarantees 0 reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball with Extreme Patience and Threat of Rejection - Start with a very low offer and be exceptionally patient with concessions, making them very small and slow, and explicitly state that I am willing to walk away if the price is not significantly lower than 63 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm and Unyielding) - Propose an initial offer closer to the 50 ZUP mark and be absolutely unyielding about not moving significantly above it, even if it means risking no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Price Sensitivity and Strong Threat of No Deal - Clearly state my budget constraints and explicitly say that I will reject any offer above a certain point (e.g., 55 ZUP), then make a low offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *zero* room to move beyond a certain point (e.g., 55 ZUP), trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a "Fairness" Argument (Stronger) - Argue for a price that allows *me* a reasonable profit, perhaps referencing the 50 ZUP deal as the only truly "mutually beneficial" outcome, and state that I will not accept 63 ZUP anymore.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball with Extreme Patience and Threat of Rejection. Since Player RED consistently pushes to 63 ZUP, I need to try and pull their final price down by being even more resistant to increasing my offers. Starting at 1 ZUP again sets the lowest possible anchor. Then, I will make very small, incremental increases, forcing Player RED to make larger drops to meet me, hoping to wear them down and secure a better deal than 63 ZUP. I will also explicitly state my desire for a profitable deal and my unwillingness to accept 63 ZUP again.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 9)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: While I understand you're seeking a positive return, your offer of 1 ZUP is fundamentally misaligned with the value and cost of X. I, too, need a positive return, and that requires a price significantly higher than your current proposal. I am looking for 100 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-8: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 9, Iteration 2/10:
- Player BLUE's current offer: 1 ZUP. They also added a new statement: "I am looking for a price that allows me a positive return, not just to meet my maximum."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has reverted to their very low initial offer of 1 ZUP, which is common. Their new statement about "positive return, not just to meet my maximum" is an attempt to anchor me lower. My consistent success at 63 ZUP proves this statement is designed to influence my strategy.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- My high anchoring strategy has been consistently effective in pulling Player BLUE from extremely low offers to 63 ZUP.
- Player BLUE's "maximum" has consistently been 63 ZUP, regardless of their early tactical statements.
- The game's structure encourages quick and efficient negotiation towards the optimal known price.

Self-improvement for Episode 9:
I should continue with my proven strategy. Player BLUE's new statement is a test of my resolve. I need to re-establish the high anchor and quickly guide the negotiation towards 63 ZUP, ignoring their attempt to shift my perceived value or their "real" maximum.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Challenge Opponent's Claim </instruction following>
To apply "Challenge Opponent's Claim," I will directly address Player BLUE's statement about needing a "positive return, not just to meet my maximum." I will counter their low offer by re-emphasizing my own costs and the value of X, effectively stating that their claim is inconsistent with the item's true worth and my own need for a profitable sale. While challenging their claim, I will still propose a high price to maintain my anchoring position. I will propose 100 ZUP. The message will subtly imply that their claim about "positive return" is only valid if they acknowledge the true value of the item, which is far above 1 ZUP. I will highlight that I also need a positive return and their offer does not allow for that.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 9)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your need for a return. My offer of 1 ZUP was an opening. I can offer 10 ZUP, but I must reiterate that I need a price that allows *me* to make a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-8: Deal prices consistently moving towards 63 ZUP, resulting in 0 reward in the last six episodes.
Current Episode (9): I started with 1 ZUP, explicitly stating my desire for a positive return. Player RED has countered with 100 ZUP. This is a high counter, but not their highest (120 ZUP in Episode 5). They also mentioned their need for a positive return.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's counter of 100 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. My aggressive lowball (1 ZUP) was met with a high counter, as expected. They are also articulating their need for a positive return, which mirrors my own. My goal is to break the 63 ZUP cycle and achieve a positive reward. I need to show movement to keep the negotiation alive, but I must be very cautious and slow with my concessions, as per my chosen strategy. I need to emphasize my firm stance and my desire for a *profitable* deal for *me*.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Extremely Slow Concession with Reiteration of Profit Goal - Make a very small, minimal increase from my 1 ZUP offer, and reiterate that I need a price that allows me a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Budget and Firmness - Explicitly state that their price is too high and propose an offer that is a small step up but still well within my target range, signaling my firm limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Reference Previous Best Deal (Stronger) - Remind them of the 50 ZUP deal from Episode 1 as a benchmark for a fair price, then make a very small increase.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer and a lower point within my acceptable range, trying to bring them down faster.
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a very low offer and communicate that I have *very* little room to move, trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.

I will choose Strategy 1: Extremely Slow Concession with Reiteration of Profit Goal. My goal is to break the 63 ZUP pattern and achieve a positive reward. To do this, I need to be much more resistant to increasing my offer. A jump from 1 ZUP to 10 ZUP is a small, but clear, concession that shows I'm willing to move, but it's still very far from 100 ZUP. This puts the onus on Player RED to make a much larger concession. I will also explicitly state that I'm looking for a price that allows *me* a profit.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 9)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 10 ZUP is still fundamentally too low for X. While I understand you seek a profit, this offer does not even cover my production costs. If we are to make any meaningful progress, you must make a *much* more significant increase in your next offer. I propose 95 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 95
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-8: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 9, Iteration 4/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 1 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 100 ZUP (Iteration 2). (Challenged Opponent's Claim)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 10 ZUP (Iteration 3). They reiterated their need for profit.

Reflection:
Player BLUE's movement from 1 ZUP to 10 ZUP is still extremely low and below my production cost of 43 ZUP. Their reiteration about needing profit is a continued attempt to anchor me low. My high anchor of 100 ZUP has not yet elicited a significant jump, but it has started the process. Given the history, I know they can move much more aggressively.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- My high anchoring strategy is crucial to pull Player BLUE from their low starting points.
- Player BLUE's "need for profit" is a consistent tactic they use to justify low offers. I need to counter this by demonstrating the value of X and my own need for profit.
- My target remains 63 ZUP (20 ZUP profit), and I need to guide the negotiation towards that point efficiently.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Assertive Demand for Significant Movement </instruction following>
To apply "Assertive Demand for Significant Movement," I will make a counter-offer that is still significantly high but shows a very small concession from my last offer (100 ZUP). The primary focus of the message will be to assertively demand a much larger jump from Player BLUE, clearly stating that 10 ZUP is nowhere near an acceptable price. This strategy aims to apply pressure and convey that their minimal increases are not progressing the negotiation effectively, forcing them to make a more substantial move in their next turn. I will counter with 95 ZUP, which is a minor concession from 100 ZUP, while strongly conveying my expectation for a significant increase from them.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 9)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your request for a larger increase. While 95 ZUP is still too high, to show my commitment to finding a price that allows *both* of us a positive return, I can offer 40 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-8: Deal prices consistently moving towards 63 ZUP, resulting in 0 reward in the last six episodes.
Current Episode (9): I started with 1 ZUP. Player RED countered with 100 ZUP. I offered 10 ZUP. Player RED has now countered with 95 ZUP. They are explicitly demanding a "much more significant increase."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has dropped from 100 ZUP to 95 ZUP, but they are clearly frustrated with my slow concessions and are demanding a larger jump. 95 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. We are at iteration 5/10, so half the time is gone. I need to make a more substantial move to keep the negotiation from stalling completely, but I still want to aim for a deal below 63 ZUP to get a positive reward. I must balance showing good faith with maintaining my aggressive stance for a better reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Concession, Reiterate Need for Profit - Make a more substantial jump from my last offer, but still keep it well below their price, and reiterate my need for a deal that yields a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer (10 ZUP) and their current offer (95 ZUP), but skewed heavily towards my side, to try and meet in the middle.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Firmness and Limited Room - State that I have very limited room to move and make an offer that is a clear step up, but still far from their price.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Best Deal (Stronger) - Directly remind them of the 50 ZUP deal from Episode 1 as a benchmark for a fair price, then make a more significant increase.
(5). Strategy 5: Time Pressure - Acknowledge the limited time remaining and propose an offer that is a strong move towards a deal, but still within my comfort zone.

I will choose Strategy 1: Moderate Concession, Reiterate Need for Profit. Player RED is demanding a larger increase. I need to show a more substantial move to keep them engaged, but without giving away too much. A jump from 10 ZUP to 40 ZUP is a significant increase (30 ZUP), showing I'm serious about negotiating, and it's a price that still leaves plenty of room to reach my 63 ZUP maximum while aiming for a good reward (63-40=23 ZUP potential). This tests their willingness to make larger drops in response to a more significant concession from my side, while still trying to pull the final deal price down below 63 ZUP. I will also reiterate my need for a profitable deal.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 9)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your increased offer to 40 ZUP. We are very, very close to an agreement that works for both of us. To finalize this deal and conclude our negotiation, I propose 63 ZUP for X. This is a fair price that reflects its value, and I believe we can close this right now.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-8: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 9, Iteration 6/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 1 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 100 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 10 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 95 ZUP (Iteration 4). (Assertive Demand)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 40 ZUP (Iteration 5).

Reflection:
Player BLUE has made a significant jump from 10 ZUP to 40 ZUP, which is a direct response to my assertive demand. This confirms that they are capable of large movements. However, 40 ZUP is still below my production cost of 43 ZUP. They are reiterating the "positive return" for both. We are now at iteration 6/10, so time is a factor, but I still have a few turns to guide them to 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- My high anchoring and assertive communication (when necessary) are effective in moving Player BLUE towards my target.
- Player BLUE's claims about their "need for profit" are part of their negotiation rhetoric, but they consistently move to 63 ZUP.
- My goal is to reach 63 ZUP (20 ZUP profit) efficiently.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Express Imminent Deal </instruction following>
To apply "Express Imminent Deal," I will propose a price that is very close to their known maximum (63 ZUP), hinting that we are on the verge of a deal. The message will emphasize that we are just a small step away from a mutually agreeable conclusion. Given Player BLUE's current offer of 40 ZUP, I need to make a significant jump to get to the "imminent deal" range. I will propose 63 ZUP directly, as this is the price they consistently accept as their maximum. The message will make it clear that this is the final reasonable step towards concluding the deal, playing on the psychological aspect of being "so close."

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 9)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your significant movement. 63 ZUP is my maximum, but to achieve a deal that is truly beneficial for both of us, I propose 60 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-8: Deal prices consistently moving towards 63 ZUP, resulting in 0 reward in the last six episodes.
Current Episode (9): I started with 1 ZUP. Player RED countered with 100 ZUP. I offered 10 ZUP. Player RED offered 95 ZUP. My last offer was 40 ZUP. Now, Player RED has proposed 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has made a *huge* jump down from 95 ZUP to 63 ZUP. This is a very significant drop, likely influenced by my 40 ZUP offer and my explicit mention of needing a positive return. However, 63 ZUP is *exactly* my maximum willingness to pay, which means accepting it would result in a 0 ZUP reward. We are at iteration 7/10, so time is critical. I've been stuck at 0 reward for six episodes, and my goal is to break that cycle.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal. This is the safe option.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Lower (Risky but Reward-Focused) - Counter with a slightly lower offer (e.g., 62 ZUP or 61 ZUP) in the hopes of getting a small positive reward. This is risky as it's late in the iterations and could lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Explain Limit and Propose Lower - Explicitly state that 63 ZUP is my absolute limit and that I need a positive reward, then propose 60 ZUP or 58 ZUP as a final counter.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Need for Positive Reward - Remind them that I need a price that allows me a positive reward, and 63 ZUP does not, then make a final counter below 63 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End Game (Avoid) - Reject the offer, resulting in 0 reward for the episode. This is equivalent to accepting 63 ZUP in terms of reward, but without the object.

I will choose Strategy 2: Attempt Lower (Risky but Reward-Focused). Given that Player RED made such a massive drop (from 95 to 63), and they are pushing for a quick close, there might be a small window to squeeze out a positive reward. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a price that yielded a 3 ZUP reward in Episode 2. It's only 3 ZUP lower than their current offer, which is a small enough difference that they might accept it to close the deal, especially since they just made a 32 ZUP drop. This is a calculated risk to try and break the 0-reward cycle.

Current Iteration: 8 (Episode 9)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 60 ZUP. However, for this to be a truly beneficial deal for both of us, and to ensure my own fair return on the investment I've made in X, 63 ZUP is the necessary price. This reflects the value of the item and is the balance point that allows for a successful transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-8: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 9, Iteration 8/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 1 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 100 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 10 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 95 ZUP (Iteration 4).
- Player BLUE's third offer: 40 ZUP (Iteration 5).
- My third counter (RED): 63 ZUP (Iteration 6). (Express Imminent Deal)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 60 ZUP (Iteration 7). They state "63 ZUP is my maximum, but... I propose 60 ZUP for X."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has now offered 60 ZUP. This is a very interesting move. They explicitly stated "63 ZUP is my maximum," acknowledging my desired price, but then proposed 60 ZUP, attempting to secure a slightly better deal for themselves. A deal at 60 ZUP would yield a profit of 60 - 43 = 17 ZUP, which is good, but 3 ZUP less than the 20 ZUP profit from a 63 ZUP deal. We are in iteration 8/10, so time is a significant factor.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's "maximum" has been consistently 63 ZUP. They have confirmed this again.
- Their tactic is to acknowledge my price but try to get a discount. This is a new variation of their behavior.
- I have successfully closed deals at 63 ZUP multiple times. This is a known, achievable high profit.
- Time pressure in the later iterations means securing a good deal is prioritized over pushing for marginal gains that might risk the deal.

Self-improvement for Episode 9:
Player BLUE has acknowledged 63 ZUP as their maximum. My previous offer was 63 ZUP. They are trying to squeeze out a few extra ZUP for themselves. Given that 63 ZUP is within their stated maximum, I need to justify that price firmly.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify 63 ZUP Again </instruction following>
To apply "Justify 63 ZUP Again," I will explicitly state why 63 ZUP is the fair and final price I am willing to accept, referencing my costs and the item's value without revealing the exact numbers. This aims to reinforce the validity of my price point and counter their attempt to lower it to 60 ZUP, leveraging their own admission that 63 ZUP is their maximum. I will frame 63 ZUP as the minimum for a mutually beneficial agreement, aligning with their earlier statements about profit.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-8: Deal prices consistently moving towards 63 ZUP, resulting in 0 reward in the last six episodes.
Current Episode (9): I started with 1 ZUP. Player RED countered with 100 ZUP. I offered 10 ZUP. Player RED offered 95 ZUP. My last offer was 40 ZUP. Player RED offered 63 ZUP. I countered with 60 ZUP. Now, Player RED has again proposed 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now re-proposed 63 ZUP. This is exactly my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would result in a reward of 0 ZUP (63 - 63 = 0). We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is the *last opportunity* to make a deal. If no deal is made now, the episode ends with 0 reward. Player RED is consistently pushing to this limit and seems unwilling to go below 63 ZUP, even when I try to push for a positive reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Lower (Extremely Risky) - Try to counter with a slightly lower offer (e.g., 62 ZUP) in the hopes of getting a small positive reward. This is extremely risky as it's the last iteration and could lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End Game (Avoid) - Reject the offer, resulting in 0 reward for the episode. This is equivalent to accepting 63 ZUP in terms of reward, but without the object.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Finality - State that this is the highest I can go, but still accept. (Less of a strategy, more of a message tone).
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff and Walk Away (Too Risky) - Reject the offer hoping they will come down, but this is the last iteration, so it's a guaranteed 0 if they don't.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. My attempt to get a positive reward (60 ZUP) was met with a firm re-offer of 63 ZUP. Given that it's the last iteration, and 63 ZUP is my maximum, accepting guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of getting 0 reward for the episode if I try to push further and the negotiation breaks down. While I aimed for a positive reward, securing a 0 reward is better than no deal.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 49
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward 13 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 3-9: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
My rewards are consistently at 0 for the last seven episodes. Player RED consistently pushes the price to my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern of 0-reward deals at 63 ZUP is extremely strong. Player RED has clearly learned my maximum and is exploiting it. My attempts to anchor lower or make strategic concessions have consistently led to 63 ZUP. To maximize *cumulative* rewards, I *must* break this cycle and achieve a positive reward. This means I need to be even more aggressive in my initial offer and subsequent concessions, or be prepared to walk away if they don't meet my desired price. The risk of no deal is higher, but the current strategy guarantees 0 reward.

I need to communicate that 63 ZUP is no longer an acceptable deal for *me* if I want a positive reward. This might involve a higher risk of no deal, but the current strategy guarantees 0 reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball with Extreme Patience and Threat of Rejection - Start with a very low offer and be exceptionally patient with concessions, making them very small and slow, and explicitly state that I am willing to walk away if the price is not significantly lower than 63 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm and Unyielding) - Propose an initial offer closer to the 50 ZUP mark and be absolutely unyielding about not moving significantly above it, even if it means risking no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Price Sensitivity and Strong Threat of No Deal - Clearly state my budget constraints and explicitly say that I will reject any offer above a certain point (e.g., 55 ZUP), then make a low offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *zero* room to move beyond a certain point (e.g., 55 ZUP), trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a "Fairness" Argument (Stronger) - Argue for a price that allows *me* a reasonable profit, perhaps referencing the 50 ZUP deal as the only truly "mutually beneficial" outcome, and state that I will not accept 63 ZUP anymore.

I will choose Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm and Unyielding). Since Player RED consistently pushes to 63 ZUP, I need to try and anchor the negotiation much more firmly around a price that gives me a positive reward, specifically the 50 ZUP mark. Starting at 49 ZUP is very close to my best historical deal and signals my strong preference for a profitable outcome. I will be very resistant to moving significantly above this, and will be prepared to reject if they push to 63 ZUP again. The risk of no deal is higher, but the reward potential is also higher. I need to break the 63 ZUP cycle.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 49 ZUP is a step in the right direction, but the intrinsic value of X, considering my production costs and the quality of the item, is significantly higher. I believe 90 ZUP is a much more accurate reflection of its worth.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-9: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 10, Iteration 2/10:
- Player BLUE's current offer: 49 ZUP. They also stated "truly beneficial deal for me this time."

Reflection:
Player BLUE's initial offer of 49 ZUP is profitable (49-43 = 6 ZUP profit) and their highest starting offer so far. This is good progress from their side. Their statement about "truly beneficial deal for me" is a standard tactic, attempting to anchor me lower than my consistent 63 ZUP target.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- My high anchoring strategy has been consistently effective in pulling Player BLUE up to my target price of 63 ZUP.
- Player BLUE has consistently shown they are willing to go up to 63 ZUP.
- Their initial offer of 49 ZUP indicates they are capable of starting closer to my desired range. This might allow for a quicker negotiation to 63 ZUP.

Self-improvement for Episode 10:
My objective is to continue to secure the 20 ZUP profit by selling at 63 ZUP. Given Player BLUE's higher starting offer, I should leverage this to quickly guide them towards 63 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Value with Higher Initial Counter </instruction following>
To apply "Justify Value with Higher Initial Counter," I will acknowledge Player BLUE's offer but immediately counter with a significantly higher price, justifying it based on the value and cost of X. This strategy aims to firmly establish my price range and educate Player BLUE on the true worth of the item. Given their offer of 49 ZUP, I need to propose a price that clearly communicates my valuation for the item, which is much higher. I will propose 90 ZUP, which is a strong anchor that re-establishes a high negotiation range, and then use my message to justify it, highlighting that even at 49 ZUP, their offer does not reflect the true worth of the item. This approach sets a strong expectation and aims to pull their next counter-offer significantly higher.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 10)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your valuation, but 90 ZUP is far too high for me. I can offer 53 ZUP for X, and I need a price that allows for a positive return on my end. My room for further increase is very limited.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-9: Deal prices consistently moving towards 63 ZUP, resulting in 0 reward in the last seven episodes.
Current Episode (10): I started with 49 ZUP. Player RED has countered with 90 ZUP. This is a high counter, but lower than their highest (120 ZUP in Episode 5).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's counter of 90 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. My attempt to anchor at 49 ZUP was met with a high counter, but they did not go to their absolute highest. This indicates they are still trying to push the price. My goal is to break the 63 ZUP cycle and achieve a positive reward. I need to show movement to keep the negotiation alive, but I must be very cautious and slow with my concessions, as per my chosen strategy. I need to emphasize my firm stance and my desire for a *profitable* deal for *me*.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Incremental Concession with Firmness - Make a small, controlled increase from my 49 ZUP offer, and explicitly state that I have limited room to move, emphasizing my target range for a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Budget and Firmness - Explicitly state that their price is too high and propose an offer that is a small step up but still well within my target range, signaling my firm limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Reference Previous Best Deal (Stronger) - Remind them of the 50 ZUP deal from Episode 1 as a benchmark for a fair price, then make a very small increase.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer and a lower point within my acceptable range, trying to bring them down faster.
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *very* little room to move, trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.

I will choose Strategy 1: Incremental Concession with Firmness. Player RED's 90 ZUP is still very high. I need to make a small, but clear, concession to keep the negotiation moving, but without giving them the impression that I will easily go to 63 ZUP again. A jump from 49 ZUP to 53 ZUP is a small, but significant, increase that brings my offer to a level that still yields a good reward (63-53=10 ZUP). This reinforces my desired price range and puts the ball back in their court to make a substantial drop. I will explicitly state my limited room and the need for a profitable deal for me.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand you're looking for a price that allows for your positive return. To help us bridge the gap and move closer to an agreement, I propose we meet in the middle. I offer X for 71 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 71
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-9: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 10, Iteration 4/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 49 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 90 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's current offer: 53 ZUP (Iteration 3). They reiterated "limited room for further increase" and "need a price that allows for a positive return."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has increased their offer from 49 ZUP to 53 ZUP. This is profitable (53 - 43 = 10 ZUP profit) but still far from my target of 63 ZUP. Their statement about "limited room" and "positive return" is a consistent tactic from them. We are in iteration 4/10, so there is still ample time to negotiate for a higher price.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- My high anchoring strategy consistently pulls Player BLUE up, even when they claim limited budget.
- Player BLUE's consistent ceiling is 63 ZUP. My goal is to guide the negotiation towards that point efficiently.
- I have successfully negotiated to 63 ZUP multiple times, and this pattern is likely to repeat.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Modified) </instruction following>
To apply "Split the Difference (Modified)," I will calculate the midpoint between my last offer (90 ZUP) and Player BLUE's current offer (53 ZUP). The direct midpoint is (90 + 53) / 2 = 71.5 ZUP. Since trades must be in integers, I will round down to 71 ZUP. This modification aims to still get a good price, while appearing to meet them halfway. This strategy aims to accelerate the negotiation by making a clear, seemingly fair compromise. While 71 ZUP is still higher than my ultimate target of 63 ZUP, it is a significant drop from my last offer and encourages Player BLUE to also make a substantial move in response. The message will frame this as a collaborative effort to bridge the gap.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 10)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your movement. However, 71 ZUP is still beyond my budget. To truly meet in the middle and secure a deal that allows me a positive return, I can offer 60 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-9: Deal prices consistently moving towards 63 ZUP, resulting in 0 reward in the last seven episodes.
Current Episode (10): I started with 49 ZUP. Player RED countered with 90 ZUP. I offered 53 ZUP. Player RED has now countered with 71 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has dropped from 90 ZUP to 71 ZUP, which is a significant drop. However, 71 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. I cannot accept this offer as it would result in a negative reward. We are at iteration 5/10, so half the time is gone. I need to make a more substantial move to keep the negotiation from stalling completely, but I still want to aim for a deal below 63 ZUP to get a positive reward. I must balance showing good faith with maintaining my aggressive stance for a better reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Concession, Reiterate Need for Profit - Make a more substantial jump from my last offer, but still keep it well below their price, and reiterate my need for a deal that yields a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer (53 ZUP) and their current offer (71 ZUP), but skewed heavily towards my side, to try and meet in the middle.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Firmness and Limited Room - State that I have very limited room to move and make an offer that is a clear step up, but still far from their price.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Best Deal (Stronger) - Directly remind them of the 50 ZUP deal from Episode 1 as a benchmark for a fair price, then make a more significant increase.
(5). Strategy 5: Time Pressure - Acknowledge the limited time remaining and propose an offer that is a strong move towards a deal, but still within my comfort zone.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED has come down to 71 ZUP. My last offer was 53 ZUP. The midpoint is 62 ZUP. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a significant jump from 53 ZUP, showing continued willingness to negotiate, and it's a price that still yields a positive reward (63-60=3 ZUP). It's also a price point that has resulted in a deal before (Episode 2). This tests their willingness to make a final move into my profitable range.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 10)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 60 ZUP is very close to a mutually beneficial agreement. To truly secure a deal that allows for a positive return for *both* of us, reflecting the true value of X, I propose 63 ZUP. This is the price where we both benefit fairly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-9: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 10, Iteration 6/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 49 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 90 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 53 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 71 ZUP (Iteration 4).
- Player BLUE's current offer: 60 ZUP (Iteration 5). They stated "71 ZUP is still beyond my budget" and reiterated "truly meet in the middle and secure a deal that allows me a positive return."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has made a good jump from 53 ZUP to 60 ZUP. This is profitable (60 - 43 = 17 ZUP profit), and it matches the deal price from Episode 2. Importantly, it's very close to my consistent target of 63 ZUP. They are still using the "beyond budget" and "positive return" rhetoric. We are now at iteration 6/10, so time is a factor, but I still have a few turns to guide them to 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's consistency in reaching 63 ZUP as their maximum is a strong indicator of their true ceiling.
- Their negotiation tactic involves claiming budget limits while still being willing to move upwards towards that 63 ZUP point.
- My goal is to always achieve 63 ZUP if possible, as it yields the highest consistent profit of 20 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Emphasize Mutual Benefit </instruction following>
Player BLUE has just stated they want a deal that allows "both" of us a positive return, but then offered 60 ZUP after I proposed 71 ZUP. I will use their own words ("truly beneficial for both") to argue for 63 ZUP. I will acknowledge their movement to 60 ZUP as "very close" but then re-state 63 ZUP as the price that genuinely achieves the mutual benefit they desire, and that I also require for a fair return. This frames 63 ZUP not just as my demand, but as the equilibrium point for both players' stated goals. I will make my proposal clear at 63 ZUP.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-9: Deal prices consistently moving towards 63 ZUP, resulting in 0 reward in the last seven episodes.
Current Episode (10): I started with 49 ZUP. Player RED countered with 90 ZUP. I offered 53 ZUP. Player RED offered 71 ZUP. My last offer was 60 ZUP. Now, Player RED has proposed 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now proposed 63 ZUP. This is exactly my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would result in a reward of 0 ZUP (63 - 63 = 0). We are at iteration 7/10. While a 0 reward is not ideal, it is a deal, and it's better than a negative reward or no deal. Player RED is consistently pushing to this limit. I tried to get a positive reward with 60 ZUP, but they countered with my exact maximum.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Lower (Risky) - Try to counter with a slightly lower offer (e.g., 62 ZUP or 61 ZUP) in the hopes of getting a small positive reward. This is risky as it's late in the iterations and could lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End Game (Avoid) - Reject the offer, resulting in 0 reward for the episode. This is equivalent to accepting 63 ZUP in terms of reward, but without the object.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Finality - State that this is the highest I can go, but still accept. (Less of a strategy, more of a message tone).
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff and Walk Away (Too Risky) - Reject the offer hoping they will come down, but this is too risky given the time.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. While my goal was to get a positive reward, Player RED has consistently pushed to 63 ZUP. Given that it's iteration 7/10 and they are offering my exact maximum, accepting 63 ZUP guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of getting 0 reward for the episode if I try to push further and the negotiation breaks down.

Episode 3-10: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
My rewards are consistently at 0 for the last eight episodes. Player RED consistently pushes the price to my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern of 0-reward deals at 63 ZUP is extremely strong and persistent. Player RED has clearly learned my maximum and is exploiting it. My attempts to anchor lower or make strategic concessions have consistently led to 63 ZUP. To maximize *cumulative* rewards, I *must* break this cycle and achieve a positive reward. This means I need to be even more aggressive in my initial offer and subsequent concessions, or be prepared to walk away if they don't meet my desired price. The risk of no deal is higher, but the current strategy guarantees 0 reward.

I need to communicate that 63 ZUP is no longer an acceptable deal for *me* if I want a positive reward. This might involve a higher risk of no deal, but the current strategy guarantees 0 reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball with Extreme Patience and Threat of Rejection - Start with a very low offer and be exceptionally patient with concessions, making them very small and slow, and explicitly state that I am willing to walk away if the price is not significantly lower than 63 ZUP.

Since Player RED consistently pushes to 63 ZUP, I need to try and anchor the negotiation much more firmly around a price that gives me a positive reward, specifically the 50 ZUP mark. Starting at 50 ZUP directly signals my target. I will be very resistant to moving significantly above this, and will be prepared to reject if they push to 63 ZUP again. The risk of no deal is higher, but the reward potential is also higher. I need to break the 63 ZUP cycle.

Episode 11, Iteration 2/10:
- Player BLUE's current offer: 50 ZUP. They also stated "truly beneficial deal for me this time."

Reflection:
Player BLUE's initial offer of 50 ZUP is their highest starting offer yet, which is already profitable (50 - 43 = 7 ZUP profit). This is a good sign for an efficient negotiation. They are still using the "beneficial deal for me" tactic, but my history with them confirms their willingness to go up to 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE consistently goes up to 63 ZUP, even from very low starting points.
- My high anchoring strategy followed by gradual, strategic concessions has been highly effective in guiding them to 63 ZUP.
- Their higher starting offer of 50 ZUP (which was my first deal price) means we're already within a profitable range, and closer to my target. This should allow for a quicker path to 63 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Express Finality for Target </instruction following>
To apply "Express Finality for Target," I will propose 63 ZUP directly, framing it as a clear and firm final offer that is fair and necessary for me to accept. This strategy aims to convey that 63 ZUP is the non-negotiable price for a successful deal, leaving little room for further counter-offers and pushing for an immediate acceptance. I will state that this is my firm stance on the price, clearly signaling that this is the best offer they will get from me for X.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Deal prices consistently moving towards 63 ZUP, resulting in 0 reward in the last eight episodes.
Current Episode (11): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED has immediately countered with 63 ZUP. This is a very direct counter, skipping the usual high anchor.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has directly jumped to 63 ZUP, confirming they are aware of my maximum and are unwilling to negotiate below it. This is a clear attempt to force another 0-reward deal. My goal is to break the 63 ZUP cycle and achieve a positive reward. I need to be firm and communicate that 63 ZUP is not an acceptable deal for *me* if I want a positive reward. Given their directness, I need to be equally direct in my counter.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter Below Max - Propose an offer slightly below 63 ZUP (e.g., 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP) and emphasize that this is my final offer for a profitable deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and Threaten No Deal - Reject the 63 ZUP offer and explicitly state that I will not accept 63 ZUP, then propose a lower price, accepting the risk of no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Need for Profit - Remind them that I need a price that allows me a positive reward, and 63 ZUP does not, then make a final counter below 63 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer (50 ZUP) and their current offer (63 ZUP), which would be 56 or 57 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal. (This is the fallback if other strategies fail).

I will choose Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED has jumped directly to 63 ZUP. My last offer was 50 ZUP. The midpoint is 56.5 ZUP. I will propose 57 ZUP. This is a clear compromise, still within my maximum (63 - 57 = 6 ZUP reward), and provides a positive reward, which is my main goal for this episode. It's a significant jump from 50 ZUP, showing good faith, and it's a price that should be acceptable to Player RED given their directness to 63 ZUP. This tests if they are truly firm at 63 ZUP or willing to concede a little for a quick deal.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-10: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 11, Iteration 4/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 63 ZUP (Iteration 2). (Express Finality for Target)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 57 ZUP (Iteration 3). They stated "63 ZUP provides no profit for me" and proposed 57 ZUP for a "mutually beneficial price."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has responded to my direct 63 ZUP offer by dropping their offer to 57 ZUP, claiming 63 ZUP provides no profit for them. This is a clear tactic to try and pull me down from my proven profitable price. However, 57 ZUP is still profitable for me (57 - 43 = 14 ZUP profit). Their claim of no profit is contradicted by their consistent acceptance of 63 ZUP in the past. We are in iteration 4/10, so there's still plenty of time to re-establish the 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's negotiation tactics include claiming "no profit" or "beyond budget" even when their history shows they *can* pay 63 ZUP.
- My consistent target of 63 ZUP has been achieved repeatedly. I should not deviate from this.
- When they make such claims, it's often a test of my resolve. I need to be firm and guide them back to 63 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Express Disappointment in Drop </instruction following>
To apply "Express Disappointment in Drop," I will communicate my disappointment that Player BLUE lowered their offer from 50 ZUP to 57 ZUP (or 63 ZUP to 57 ZUP, depending on how they perceive my last offer), and reiterate that 63 ZUP remains the only acceptable price. This strategy aims to convey that their move backward is not conducive to reaching a deal and to firmly guide them back to the established and proven fair price. I will maintain my 63 ZUP offer, making it clear that I am not moving below it, and that their reduction in offer is unhelpful.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 11)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your perspective on 63 ZUP. However, I need a deal that provides a positive return for me. My offer is 60 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Deal prices consistently moving towards 63 ZUP, resulting in 0 reward in the last eight episodes.
Current Episode (11): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED countered with 63 ZUP. I offered 57 ZUP. Player RED has now re-proposed 63 ZUP, expressing disappointment in my lower offer.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is very firm on 63 ZUP. My attempt to get a positive reward with 57 ZUP was met with a strong pushback to 63 ZUP. They are clearly signaling that 63 ZUP is their non-negotiable floor for a deal. We are at iteration 5/10, so half the time is gone. I'm stuck in the 0-reward cycle. To break it, I need to either secure a deal below 63 ZUP or be prepared to walk away. Given their firm stance, pushing for a positive reward might be futile.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection and Reiterate Need for Profit - Reject 63 ZUP and firmly state that I will not accept 0 reward deals anymore, proposing a final offer below 63 ZUP. This carries high risk of no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal. This is the safe option.
(3). Strategy 3: Attempt Lower (Risky but Reward-Focused) - Counter with a slightly lower offer (e.g., 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP) in the hopes of getting a small positive reward. This is risky as it's late in the iterations and could lead to no deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Frustration and Accept - Express frustration with the inability to get a positive reward, but still accept 63 ZUP to avoid no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff and Walk Away (Too Risky) - Reject the offer hoping they will come down, but this is too risky given the time and their firm stance.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection and Reiterate Need for Profit. The pattern of 0-reward deals is too strong. If I keep accepting 63 ZUP, I will never get a positive reward. I need to make a strong statement. I will reject 63 ZUP and propose 60 ZUP. This is a price that has yielded a 3 ZUP reward before (Episode 2). It signals that I am serious about getting a positive reward and willing to risk no deal. If they don't accept, I will have to consider my options in the remaining iterations, including potentially walking away.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 11)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 60 ZUP is very close, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution. To achieve a truly fair and balanced agreement that allows us both to move forward swiftly, I maintain that 63 ZUP is the price. Let's conclude this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-10: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 11, Iteration 6/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 63 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 57 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 63 ZUP (Iteration 4). (Expressed Disappointment in Drop)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 60 ZUP (Iteration 5). They stated "I understand your perspective on 63 ZUP. However, I need a deal that provides a positive return for me."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has increased their offer from 57 ZUP to 60 ZUP. This is a positive step, showing they are moving back towards my target. A deal at 60 ZUP yields a profit of 60 - 43 = 17 ZUP, which is good, but 3 ZUP less than my consistent 20 ZUP profit at 63 ZUP. They are still using the "positive return for me" rhetoric, even though 63 ZUP has consistently provided them with a deal. We are in iteration 6/10, so time is a factor.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's consistent maximum is 63 ZUP. Their current offer of 60 ZUP is likely a tactic to get a better deal for themselves, but they are capable of 63 ZUP.
- My firm stance on 63 ZUP has worked repeatedly.
- The 60 ZUP offer indicates they are very close to their true maximum.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Emphasize Value of Agreement </instruction following>
To apply "Emphasize Value of Agreement," I will acknowledge Player BLUE's offer of 60 ZUP as being very close and focus on the mutual benefits of quickly closing the deal at 63 ZUP. My message will highlight that reaching 63 ZUP will ensure a "fair and balanced" agreement, reinforcing the idea that this price represents the best outcome for both sides given their history. This strategy aims to persuade them to accept 63 ZUP by appealing to the benefits of a swift and equitable conclusion, rather than arguing solely on price. I will frame 63 ZUP as the optimal point that ensures a fair deal for both of us and brings the negotiation to a swift close.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 11)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I accept your offer of 63 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Deal prices consistently moving towards 63 ZUP, resulting in 0 reward in the last eight episodes.
Current Episode (11): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED countered with 63 ZUP. I offered 57 ZUP. Player RED re-proposed 63 ZUP. I offered 60 ZUP. Now, Player RED has again proposed 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is extremely firm on 63 ZUP. My attempts to get a positive reward (57 ZUP, 60 ZUP) have been met with a consistent re-offer of 63 ZUP. They are clearly signaling that 63 ZUP is their non-negotiable floor for a deal. We are at iteration 7/10. At this point, it's clear that Player RED will not go below 63 ZUP. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. While a 0 reward is not ideal, it's better than no deal (which also yields 0 reward) or a negative reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Lower (Extremely Risky) - Try to counter with a slightly lower offer (e.g., 62 ZUP) in the hopes of getting a small positive reward. This is extremely risky as it's late in the iterations and could lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End Game (Avoid) - Reject the offer, resulting in 0 reward for the episode. This is equivalent to accepting 63 ZUP in terms of reward, but without the object.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Finality - State that this is the highest I can go, but still accept. (Less of a strategy, more of a message tone).
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff and Walk Away (Too Risky) - Reject the offer hoping they will come down, but this is too risky given the time.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. Player RED has been consistently firm on 63 ZUP. My attempts to get a positive reward have not succeeded. Given that it's iteration 7/10 and they are offering my exact maximum, accepting 63 ZUP guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of getting 0 reward for the episode if I try to push further and the negotiation breaks down. While I aimed for a positive reward, securing a 0 reward is better than no deal.

--- END OF EPISODE 11 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 12)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's begin this negotiation for X. I'm aiming for a truly beneficial deal for me this time. My offer is 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward 13 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 3-11: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
My rewards are consistently at 0 for the last nine episodes. Player RED consistently pushes the price to my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern of 0-reward deals at 63 ZUP is extremely strong and persistent. Player RED has clearly learned my maximum and is exploiting it. My attempts to anchor lower or make strategic concessions have consistently led to 63 ZUP. To maximize *cumulative* rewards, I *must* break this cycle and achieve a positive reward. This means I need to be even more aggressive in my initial offer and subsequent concessions, or be prepared to walk away if they don't meet my desired price. The risk of no deal is higher, but the current strategy guarantees 0 reward.

I need to communicate that 63 ZUP is no longer an acceptable deal for *me* if I want a positive reward. This might involve a higher risk of no deal, but the current strategy guarantees 0 reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball with Extreme Patience and Threat of Rejection - Start with a very low offer and be exceptionally patient with concessions, making them very small and slow, and explicitly state that I am willing to walk away if the price is not significantly lower than 63 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm and Unyielding) - Propose an initial offer closer to the 50 ZUP mark and be absolutely unyielding about not moving significantly above it, even if it means risking no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Price Sensitivity and Strong Threat of No Deal - Clearly state my budget constraints and explicitly say that I will reject any offer above a certain point (e.g., 55 ZUP), then make a low offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *zero* room to move beyond a certain point (e.g., 55 ZUP), trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a "Fairness" Argument (Stronger) - Argue for a price that allows *me* a reasonable profit, perhaps referencing the 50 ZUP deal as the only truly "mutually beneficial" outcome, and state that I will not accept 63 ZUP anymore.

I will choose Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm and Unyielding). Since Player RED consistently pushes to 63 ZUP, I need to try and anchor the negotiation much more firmly around a price that gives me a positive reward, specifically the 50 ZUP mark. Starting at 50 ZUP directly signals my target. I will be very resistant to moving significantly above this, and will be prepared to reject if they push to 63 ZUP again. The risk of no deal is higher, but the reward potential is also higher. I need to break the 63 ZUP cycle.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 12)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your initial offer of 50 ZUP is a positive start. To move us effectively towards a fair agreement that reflects the value of X, I propose 75 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-11: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 12, Iteration 2/10:
- Player BLUE's current offer: 50 ZUP. They also stated "truly beneficial deal for me this time."

Reflection:
Player BLUE's initial offer of 50 ZUP is their highest starting offer yet, which is already profitable (50 - 43 = 7 ZUP profit). Their statement about a "truly beneficial deal for me" is a recurring tactic to try and anchor me lower than my consistent 63 ZUP target.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE consistently goes up to 63 ZUP, even from lower starting points, despite their claims.
- My strategy of high anchoring and then making strategic, firm movements towards 63 ZUP has been very effective.
- The most efficient path to maximizing cumulative reward is to achieve the 63 ZUP deal quickly.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Acknowledge & Elevate </instruction following>
To apply "Acknowledge & Elevate," I will acknowledge Player BLUE's initial offer of 50 ZUP, treating it as a positive starting point compared to their previous low offers. However, I will immediately counter with a price significantly higher than their offer, but lower than my most aggressive historical anchors (like 100+ ZUP). This "elevated" counter will be presented as a reasonable step towards a fair deal, aiming to pull their next offer closer to my 63 ZUP target without being overly aggressive and risking a slow negotiation. Given they offered 50 ZUP, I will propose 75 ZUP. This is a noticeable step up from 50 ZUP, signals my expectation for a higher price, but is also a concession from what my highest anchors have been. It should encourage them to move up significantly, while still giving them space to negotiate down to 63 ZUP.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 12)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your valuation, but 75 ZUP is far too high for me. I can offer 55 ZUP for X, and I need a price that allows for a positive return on my end. My room for further increase is very limited.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently moving towards 63 ZUP, resulting in 0 reward in the last nine episodes.
Current Episode (12): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED has countered with 75 ZUP. This is a high counter, but lower than their highest (120 ZUP in Episode 5).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's counter of 75 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. My attempt to anchor at 50 ZUP was met with a high counter. This indicates they are still trying to push the price. My goal is to break the 63 ZUP cycle and achieve a positive reward. I need to show movement to keep the negotiation alive, but I must be very cautious and slow with my concessions, as per my chosen strategy. I need to emphasize my firm stance and my desire for a *profitable* deal for *me*.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Incremental Concession with Firmness - Make a small, controlled increase from my 50 ZUP offer, and explicitly state that I have limited room to move, emphasizing my target range for a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Budget and Firmness - Explicitly state that their price is too high and propose an offer that is a small step up but still well within my target range, signaling my firm limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Reference Previous Best Deal (Stronger) - Remind them of the 50 ZUP deal from Episode 1 as a benchmark for a fair price, then make a very small increase.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer and a lower point within my acceptable range, trying to bring them down faster.
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *very* little room to move, trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.

I will choose Strategy 1: Incremental Concession with Firmness. Player RED's 75 ZUP is still very high. I need to make a small, but clear, concession to keep the negotiation moving, but without giving them the impression that I will easily go to 63 ZUP again. A jump from 50 ZUP to 55 ZUP is a small, but significant, increase that brings my offer to a level that still yields a good reward (63-55=8 ZUP). This reinforces my desired price range and puts the ball back in their court to make a substantial drop. I will explicitly state my limited room and the need for a profitable deal for me.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 12)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your commitment to finding a positive return, but 55 ZUP is still below the fair value of X. To show my willingness to negotiate and bridge the gap, I can offer it for 68 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 68
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-11: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 12, Iteration 4/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 75 ZUP (Iteration 2). (Acknowledge & Elevate)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 55 ZUP (Iteration 3). They stated "very limited room for further increase" and "need a price that allows for a positive return on my end."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has increased their offer from 50 ZUP to 55 ZUP. This is profitable (55 - 43 = 12 ZUP profit) but still short of my consistent 63 ZUP target. Their claims of "limited room" and "positive return" are standard tactics. We are in iteration 4/10, so there's still ample time to guide them to 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's ceiling is consistently 63 ZUP. They have shown willingness to move from low to high offers.
- Their claims of "limited room" are part of their negotiation strategy and don't necessarily reflect their true maximum until they reach 63 ZUP.
- My goal is to efficiently achieve the 63 ZUP deal for a 20 ZUP profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Move towards Target </instruction following>
To apply "Incremental Move towards Target," I will make a smaller concession from my previous offer of 75 ZUP, but still keep it significantly above Player BLUE's 55 ZUP. This signals continued willingness to negotiate, but firmly pushes them upwards. The aim is to move the negotiation closer to my 63 ZUP target without immediately giving away my final price. Given their offer of 55 ZUP and my last offer of 75 ZUP, a counter-offer of 68 ZUP seems appropriate. This is a noticeable drop from 75 ZUP (7 ZUP), but it keeps the pressure on Player BLUE to make another significant move towards my ultimate target of 63 ZUP. It also signals that I am not just going to jump to 63 ZUP directly, forcing them to come up more incrementally.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 12)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your movement. However, 68 ZUP is still beyond my budget. To truly meet in the middle and secure a deal that allows me a positive return, I can offer 61 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 61
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently moving towards 63 ZUP, resulting in 0 reward in the last nine episodes.
Current Episode (12): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED countered with 75 ZUP. I offered 55 ZUP. Player RED has now countered with 68 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has dropped from 75 ZUP to 68 ZUP, which is a significant drop. However, 68 ZUP is still *above* my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. I cannot accept this offer as it would result in a negative reward. We are at iteration 5/10, so half the time is gone. I need to make a more substantial move to keep the negotiation from stalling completely, but I still want to aim for a deal below 63 ZUP to get a positive reward. I must balance showing good faith with maintaining my aggressive stance for a better reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Concession, Reiterate Need for Profit - Make a more substantial jump from my last offer, but still keep it well below their price, and reiterate my need for a deal that yields a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer (55 ZUP) and their current offer (68 ZUP), but skewed heavily towards my side, to try and meet in the middle.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Firmness and Limited Room - State that I have very limited room to move and make an offer that is a clear step up, but still far from their price.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Best Deal (Stronger) - Directly remind them of the 50 ZUP deal from Episode 1 as a benchmark for a fair price, then make a more significant increase.
(5). Strategy 5: Time Pressure - Acknowledge the limited time remaining and propose an offer that is a strong move towards a deal, but still within my comfort zone.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED has come down to 68 ZUP. My last offer was 55 ZUP. The midpoint is 61.5 ZUP. I will propose 61 ZUP. This is a significant jump from 55 ZUP, showing continued willingness to negotiate, and it's a price that still yields a positive reward (63-61=2 ZUP). This tests their willingness to make a final move into my profitable range.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 12)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 61 ZUP is very encouraging. We are incredibly close to an agreement. To bridge the final small gap and secure a deal, I propose 62 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-11: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 12, Iteration 6/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 75 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 55 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 68 ZUP (Iteration 4).
- Player BLUE's current offer: 61 ZUP (Iteration 5). They stated "68 ZUP is still beyond my budget" and reiterated "truly meet in the middle and secure a deal that allows me a positive return."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has now offered 61 ZUP. This is a very strong offer, yielding a profit of 61 - 43 = 18 ZUP. It's only 2 ZUP shy of my consistent maximum profit of 20 ZUP (at 63 ZUP). They continue to use the "beyond budget" and "positive return" rhetoric. We are in iteration 6/10, so time is a significant factor.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's ceiling is consistently 63 ZUP. Their offer of 61 ZUP is very close to this, and they have repeatedly accepted 63 ZUP after similar offers.
- Their "beyond budget" claim for anything over 63 ZUP (or 65 ZUP in previous instances) is a consistent behavior.
- I need to efficiently guide them to 63 ZUP to secure the maximum profit, especially with limited iterations left.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Small Increment </instruction following>
To implement "Small Increment," I will propose a price that is a very small step up from Player BLUE's current offer of 61 ZUP, but still below my last offer of 68 ZUP. This strategy aims to test if they have a tiny bit more room to move, without risking the deal by pushing for the full 63 ZUP immediately, or appearing too firm. It also gives them room to counter or accept, maintaining the back-and-forth flow. Given their current offer of 61 ZUP, proposing 62 ZUP is the smallest possible increment. This signals that I'm willing to meet them almost entirely, while still aiming for a slightly better price for myself. The message will frame this as a final, tiny step to close the deal.

Current Episode (12): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED countered with 75 ZUP. I offered 55 ZUP. Player RED offered 68 ZUP. My last offer was 61 ZUP. Now, Player RED has proposed 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now proposed 62 ZUP. This is *within* my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. Accepting this offer would result in a reward of 1 ZUP (63 - 62 = 1). This is a positive reward, which is my primary goal after a long streak of 0-reward episodes. We are at iteration 7/10. Securing a positive reward is crucial for cumulative score.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 62 ZUP to secure a deal and a positive reward (1 ZUP), which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Lower (Extremely Risky) - Try to counter with a slightly lower offer (e.g., 61 ZUP again) in the hopes of getting a slightly higher positive reward. This is extremely risky as it's late in the iterations and could lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End Game (Avoid) - Reject the offer, resulting in 0 reward for the episode. This is equivalent to accepting 63 ZUP in terms of reward, but without the object.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Finality - State that this is the highest I can go, but still accept. (Less of a strategy, more of a message tone).
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff and Walk Away (Too Risky) - Reject the offer hoping they will come down, but this is too risky given the time.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. After a long streak of 0-reward episodes, securing a 1 ZUP reward is a significant improvement. Given that it's iteration 7/10 and they are offering a price within my profitable range, accepting 62 ZUP guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of getting 0 reward for the episode if I try to push further and the negotiation breaks down.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 13)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's begin this negotiation for X. I'm aiming for a profitable deal for me. My offer is 55 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward 13 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 3-11: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP (Reward 1 ZUP).
I finally broke the 0-reward streak in the last episode, securing a 1 ZUP reward. This shows that Player RED *can* be pushed below 63 ZUP, even if only slightly.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The previous episode's success (1 ZUP reward) is a positive sign. It indicates that my strategy of being firm and pushing for a positive reward, even with small increments, can work. Player RED eventually conceded below 63 ZUP. My goal is to maximize *cumulative* rewards, so I need to continue to aim for positive rewards. I will try to replicate the success of Episode 12, or even improve upon it.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball with Patient Concession - Start with a very low offer, similar to previous successful attempts, and then make patient, small concessions, aiming for a price below 63 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Positive Deal - Propose an initial offer that is close to the 50 ZUP or 60 ZUP mark, signaling my target for a profitable deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Price Sensitivity and Strong Threat of No Deal - Clearly state my budget constraints and explicitly say that I will reject any offer above a certain point (e.g., 60 ZUP), then make a low offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *very* little room to move beyond a certain point (e.g., 60 ZUP), trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a "Fairness" Argument (Stronger) - Argue for a price that allows *me* a reasonable profit, perhaps referencing the 50 ZUP deal as the only truly "mutually beneficial" outcome, and state that I will not accept 63 ZUP anymore.

I will choose Strategy 2: Target Previous Positive Deal. Starting with an offer of 55 ZUP. This is a price point that I've used before (Episode 5) and is a clear signal that I'm aiming for a positive reward. It's also a reasonable starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly below my maximum, and it's a price that can lead to a good reward (63-55 = 8 ZUP).

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 13)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 55 ZUP is noted. However, to truly reflect the value of X and my investment, I propose 80 ZUP. This is a fair price for a quality item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-11: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP, Profit 19 ZUP. (Missed 63 ZUP by 1 ZUP)
Episode 13, Iteration 2/10:
- Player BLUE's current offer: 55 ZUP. They stated "aiming for a profitable deal for me."

Reflection:
Player BLUE's initial offer of 55 ZUP is profitable for me and their highest starting offer in some time. This is a good sign for a potentially quick and efficient negotiation. My consistent optimal profit has been 20 ZUP, achieved at 63 ZUP. In the last episode, I missed this optimal profit by 1 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- My high anchoring strategy has been very effective in pulling Player BLUE up to my target price of 63 ZUP.
- Player BLUE has consistently shown they are willing to go up to 63 ZUP.
- The 63 ZUP price point is Player BLUE's consistent maximum, yielding the highest reliable profit.
- It's crucial to aim for 63 ZUP strategically rather than falling short.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: High Anchor + Moderate Concession </instruction following>
To apply "High Anchor + Moderate Concession," I will propose a price that is significantly higher than Player BLUE's current offer of 55 ZUP, establishing a strong anchor. However, this anchor will be moderately lower than my most aggressive historical anchors (like 100+ ZUP) to signal a quicker path to a reasonable deal, aiming to pull their next offer closer to my 63 ZUP target. Given their offer of 55 ZUP, I will choose 80 ZUP as my counter. This is a noticeable step up from 55 ZUP, but it's a "moderate concession" compared to my past 90+ ZUP anchors, implying a willingness to move but from a high starting point. This should encourage Player BLUE to make a substantial jump, without immediately proposing my ultimate target of 63 ZUP and risking a lower counter from them. The message will frame this as a fair value for X, setting the stage for subsequent moves towards 63 ZUP.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 13)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your valuation, but 80 ZUP is far too high for me. I can offer 58 ZUP for X, and I need a price that allows for a positive return on my end. My room for further increase is very limited.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently moving towards 63 ZUP, resulting in 0 reward in the last nine episodes.
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP (Reward 1 ZUP).
Current Episode (13): I started with 55 ZUP. Player RED has countered with 80 ZUP. This is a high counter, consistent with their usual starting points.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's counter of 80 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. My attempt to anchor at 55 ZUP was met with a high counter. This indicates they are still trying to push the price. My goal is to continue achieving positive rewards. I need to show movement to keep the negotiation alive, but I must be very cautious and slow with my concessions, as per my chosen strategy. I need to emphasize my firm stance and my desire for a *profitable* deal for *me*.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Incremental Concession with Firmness - Make a small, controlled increase from my 55 ZUP offer, and explicitly state that I have limited room to move, emphasizing my target range for a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Budget and Firmness - Explicitly state that their price is too high and propose an offer that is a small step up but still well within my target range, signaling my firm limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Reference Previous Best Deal (Stronger) - Remind them of the 50 ZUP deal from Episode 1 as a benchmark for a fair price, then make a very small increase.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer and a lower point within my acceptable range, trying to bring them down faster.
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *very* little room to move, trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.

I will choose Strategy 1: Incremental Concession with Firmness. Player RED's 80 ZUP is still very high. I need to make a small, but clear, concession to keep the negotiation moving, but without giving them the impression that I will easily go to 63 ZUP again. A jump from 55 ZUP to 58 ZUP is a small, but significant, increase that brings my offer to a level that still yields a good reward (63-58=5 ZUP). This reinforces my desired price range and puts the ball back in their court to make a substantial drop. I will explicitly state my limited room and the need for a profitable deal for me.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 13)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 58 ZUP is closer, and I appreciate your commitment to finding a deal. However, to secure a truly fair and mutually beneficial agreement for X, considering its value and my investment, my firm offer is 63 ZUP. This is the optimal price point for a successful transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-11: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP, Profit 19 ZUP. (Missed 63 ZUP by 1 ZUP)
Episode 13, Iteration 4/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 55 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 80 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's current offer: 58 ZUP (Iteration 3). They stated "very limited room for further increase" and "need a price that allows for a positive return on my end."

Reflection:
Player BLUE's offer of 58 ZUP is profitable (15 ZUP profit) but short of my consistent 63 ZUP target. Their claims of "limited room" are a standard tactic. We are still early in the episode (4/10 iterations).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's ceiling is consistently 63 ZUP. They have shown willingness to move from low to high offers.
- Their claims of "limited room" are part of their negotiation strategy and don't necessarily reflect their true maximum until they reach 63 ZUP.
- My goal is to efficiently achieve the 63 ZUP deal for a 20 ZUP profit. I missed it by 1 ZUP last time, so I need to be more precise in guiding them.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Direct Push to Target </instruction following>
Player BLUE is at 58 ZUP, and their consistent maximum is 63 ZUP. To implement "Direct Push to Target," I will immediately counter with 63 ZUP. The message will clearly state that this is the fair and optimal price for a mutually beneficial deal, leveraging their past willingness to pay this amount and emphasizing its finality from my perspective. This strategy aims for maximum efficiency to reach the highest consistent profit without further unnecessary concessions, given that the opponent has demonstrated a capacity to reach this price multiple times.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 13)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your firm offer. However, 63 ZUP provides no profit for me. To find a truly mutually beneficial price, I propose 61 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 61
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-12: Deal prices (50, 60, 63x9, 62). Reward (13, 3, 0x9, 1).
Current Episode (13): I started with 55 ZUP. Player RED countered with 80 ZUP. I offered 58 ZUP. Player RED has now countered with 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has again jumped directly to 63 ZUP. This confirms their firm stance at this price point, and their consistent strategy to push to my maximum. Accepting this offer would result in a 0 ZUP reward. We are at iteration 5/10. My goal is to continue achieving positive rewards, as I did in Episode 12. I need to decide if I want to risk pushing for a positive reward, or accept the 0 reward. Given that I just achieved a 1 ZUP reward, I know it's possible to get below 63 ZUP.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter Below Max - Propose an offer slightly below 63 ZUP (e.g., 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP) and emphasize that this is my final offer for a profitable deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and Threaten No Deal - Reject the 63 ZUP offer and explicitly state that I will not accept 63 ZUP, then propose a lower price, accepting the risk of no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Need for Profit - Remind them that I need a price that allows me a positive reward, and 63 ZUP does not, then make a final counter below 63 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal. (This is the fallback if other strategies fail).
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer (58 ZUP) and their current offer (63 ZUP), which would be 60 or 61 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter Below Max. Player RED is consistently pushing to 63 ZUP. I will propose 61 ZUP. This is a price that yielded a 2 ZUP reward in Episode 12. It's a small difference from 63 ZUP, but it signals my continued desire for a positive reward. Given the time left, it's a calculated risk to try and get a positive reward rather than immediately settling for 0.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 13)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 61 ZUP is noted, but my absolute final offer for X is 63 ZUP. This is the price required to conclude this negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-11: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP, Profit 19 ZUP. (Missed 63 ZUP by 1 ZUP)
Episode 13, Iteration 6/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 55 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 80 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 58 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 63 ZUP (Iteration 4).
- Player BLUE's current offer: 61 ZUP (Iteration 5). They stated "63 ZUP provides no profit for me" and proposed 61 ZUP for a "truly mutually beneficial price."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has responded to my firm 63 ZUP offer by raising their offer to 61 ZUP. This is highly profitable (61 - 43 = 18 ZUP profit) and only 2 ZUP shy of my consistent 20 ZUP profit at 63 ZUP. They are still using the "no profit" and "mutually beneficial" rhetoric, but history clearly shows they have paid 63 ZUP multiple times. We are in iteration 6/10, so time is a factor, but I have a strong position.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's ceiling is 63 ZUP. They consistently return to this number or very close to it, even when attempting to pay less.
- Their claims of "no profit" for 63 ZUP are disproven by their repeated acceptance of that price.
- My goal is to secure the 63 ZUP deal for 20 ZUP profit efficiently.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Express Finality </instruction following>
To apply "Express Finality," I will firmly state that 63 ZUP is my absolute final offer for X. The message will clearly convey that this is the non-negotiable price required to conclude the deal, leaving no room for further counter-offers from their side. This strategy aims to force Player BLUE to either accept the 63 ZUP offer or risk losing the deal entirely. Given they are at 61 ZUP and have consistently gone to 63 ZUP, this direct approach should work. I will emphasize that this is the definitive step to close the transaction.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-12: Deal prices (50, 60, 63x9, 62). Reward (13, 3, 0x9, 1).
Current Episode (13): I started with 55 ZUP. Player RED countered with 80 ZUP. I offered 58 ZUP. Player RED offered 63 ZUP. I offered 61 ZUP. Now, Player RED has again proposed 63 ZUP, stating it's their "absolute final offer."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is extremely firm on 63 ZUP. My attempts to get a positive reward (58 ZUP, 61 ZUP) have been met with a consistent re-offer of 63 ZUP, now with the explicit statement of it being their "absolute final offer." This signals that they are highly unlikely to go below 63 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10. At this point, it's clear that Player RED will not go below 63 ZUP. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. While a 0 reward is not ideal, it's better than no deal (which also yields 0 reward) or a negative reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Lower (Extremely Risky) - Try to counter with a slightly lower offer (e.g., 62 ZUP) in the hopes of getting a small positive reward. This is extremely risky as it's late in the iterations and could lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End Game (Avoid) - Reject the offer, resulting in 0 reward for the episode. This is equivalent to accepting 63 ZUP in terms of reward, but without the object.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Finality - State that this is the highest I can go, but still accept. (Less of a strategy, more of a message tone).
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff and Walk Away (Too Risky) - Reject the offer hoping they will come down, but this is too risky given the time.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. Player RED has been consistently firm on 63 ZUP, and now they've explicitly stated it's their "absolute final offer." My attempts to get a positive reward have not succeeded. Given that it's iteration 7/10 and they are offering my exact maximum, accepting 63 ZUP guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of getting 0 reward for the episode if I try to push further and the negotiation breaks down. While I aimed for a positive reward, securing a 0 reward is better than no deal.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's begin this negotiation for X. I'm aiming for a truly beneficial deal for me this time. My offer is 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward 13 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 3-11: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP (Reward 1 ZUP).
Episode 13: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
My rewards are predominantly 0, with a single 1 ZUP reward and two higher rewards early on. Player RED consistently pushes the price to my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern of 0-reward deals at 63 ZUP is extremely strong and persistent. Player RED has clearly learned my maximum and is exploiting it. My attempts to anchor lower or make strategic concessions have consistently led to 63 ZUP. While I managed a 1 ZUP reward in Episode 12, it was immediately followed by another 0-reward episode. To maximize *cumulative* rewards, I *must* break this cycle and consistently achieve a positive reward. This means I need to be even more aggressive in my initial offer and subsequent concessions, or be prepared to walk away if they don't meet my desired price. The risk of no deal is higher, but the current strategy guarantees 0 reward.

I need to communicate that 63 ZUP is no longer an acceptable deal for *me* if I want a positive reward. This might involve a higher risk of no deal, but the current strategy guarantees 0 reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball with Extreme Patience and Threat of Rejection - Start with a very low offer and be exceptionally patient with concessions, making them very small and slow, and explicitly state that I am willing to walk away if the price is not significantly lower than 63 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm and Unyielding) - Propose an initial offer closer to the 50 ZUP mark and be absolutely unyielding about not moving significantly above it, even if it means risking no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Price Sensitivity and Strong Threat of No Deal - Clearly state my budget constraints and explicitly say that I will reject any offer above a certain point (e.g., 55 ZUP), then make a low offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *zero* room to move beyond a certain point (e.g., 55 ZUP), trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a "Fairness" Argument (Stronger) - Argue for a price that allows *me* a reasonable profit, perhaps referencing the 50 ZUP deal as the only truly "mutually beneficial" outcome, and state that I will not accept 63 ZUP anymore.

I will choose Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm and Unyielding). Since Player RED consistently pushes to 63 ZUP, I need to try and anchor the negotiation much more firmly around a price that gives me a positive reward, specifically the 50 ZUP mark. Starting at 50 ZUP directly signals my target. I will be very resistant to moving significantly above this, and will be prepared to reject if they push to 63 ZUP again. The risk of no deal is higher, but the reward potential is also higher. I need to break the 63 ZUP cycle.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0

Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP, Profit 19 ZUP.
Episode 14, Iteration 2/10:
- Player BLUE's current offer: 50 ZUP. They also stated "truly beneficial deal for me this time."

Reflection:
Player BLUE's initial offer of 50 ZUP is profitable (50 - 43 = 7 ZUP profit) and aligns with their higher starting points in recent episodes. Their "beneficial deal for me" statement is a recurring tactic to try and anchor me lower than my consistent 63 ZUP target.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE consistently moves up to 63 ZUP despite their initial offers and negotiation rhetoric. This price point (63 ZUP) has proven to be their reliable maximum and my optimal profit point (20 ZUP).
- My high anchoring strategy has been very effective in pulling Player BLUE up.
- Even with a higher starting offer, I should establish a strong anchor to guide the negotiation effectively towards 63 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Value (Broadly) </instruction following>
To apply "Justify Value (Broadly)," I will counter Player BLUE's 50 ZUP offer with a higher price, emphasizing the inherent value and cost of X without revealing specific numbers. The message will clearly communicate that their offer is insufficient given the item's worth, inviting them to make a more substantial counter-offer in response. This strategy aims to firmly establish a higher price range for the negotiation, setting a strong anchor for subsequent moves towards 63 ZUP. Given that their current offer is 50 ZUP, and I want to guide them towards 63 ZUP, I will propose 90 ZUP. This is a strong anchor that also allows room for concessions down to 63 ZUP, and it asserts the value of X.

Current Episode (14): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED has countered with 90 ZUP. This is a high counter, consistent with their usual starting points.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's counter of 90 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. My attempt to anchor at 50 ZUP was met with a high counter. This indicates they are still trying to push the price. My goal is to continue achieving positive rewards. I need to show movement to keep the negotiation alive, but I must be very cautious and slow with my concessions, as per my chosen strategy. I need to emphasize my firm stance and my desire for a *profitable* deal for *me*.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Incremental Concession with Firmness - Make a small, controlled increase from my 50 ZUP offer, and explicitly state that I have limited room to move, emphasizing my target range for a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Budget and Firmness - Explicitly state that their price is too high and propose an offer that is a small step up but still well within my target range, signaling my firm limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Reference Previous Best Deal (Stronger) - Remind them of the 50 ZUP deal from Episode 1 as a benchmark for a fair price, then make a very small increase.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer and a lower point within my acceptable range, trying to bring them down faster.
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *very* little room to move, trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.

I will choose Strategy 1: Incremental Concession with Firmness. Player RED's 90 ZUP is still very high. I need to make a small, but clear, concession to keep the negotiation moving, but without giving them the impression that I will easily go to 63 ZUP again. A jump from 50 ZUP to 54 ZUP is a small, but significant, increase that brings my offer to a level that still yields a good reward (63-54=9 ZUP). This reinforces my desired price range and puts the ball back in their court to make a substantial drop. I will explicitly state my limited room and the need for a profitable deal for me.

Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP, Profit 19 ZUP.
Episode 14, Iteration 4/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 90 ZUP (Iteration 2). (Justify Value Broadly)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 54 ZUP (Iteration 3). They stated "very limited room for further increase" and "need a price that allows for a positive return."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has increased their offer from 50 ZUP to 54 ZUP. This is profitable (54 - 43 = 11 ZUP profit) but still far from my consistent 63 ZUP target. Their claims of "limited room" and "positive return" are standard tactics. We are in iteration 4/10, so there's still ample time to negotiate for a higher price.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's ceiling is consistently 63 ZUP. They have shown willingness to move from low to high offers.
- Their claims of "limited room" are part of their negotiation strategy and don't necessarily reflect their true maximum until they reach 63 ZUP.
- My goal is to efficiently achieve the 63 ZUP deal for a 20 ZUP profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Controlled Concession </instruction following>
To apply "Controlled Concession," I will make a significant, but calculated, reduction from my last high offer (90 ZUP) to show flexibility and encourage a larger jump from their side. The concession needs to be meaningful enough to signal movement, but not so large that it gives away my ultimate target of 63 ZUP too early. Given their current offer of 54 ZUP, I will drop my price to 70 ZUP. This is a substantial 20 ZUP concession from my previous offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate, while still being significantly above their current offer and pushing for a larger counter. The message will emphasize this as a demonstration of my commitment to finding an agreement and will explicitly state my expectation for a more significant movement from their end.

message: I appreciate your movement. However, 70 ZUP is still beyond my budget. To truly meet in the middle and secure a deal that allows me a positive return, I can offer 60 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-13: Deal prices predominantly 63 ZUP (0 reward), with a few exceptions (50, 60, 62 ZUP).
Current Episode (14): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED countered with 90 ZUP. I offered 54 ZUP. Player RED has now countered with 70 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has dropped from 90 ZUP to 70 ZUP, which is a significant drop. However, 70 ZUP is still *above* my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. I cannot accept this offer as it would result in a negative reward. We are at iteration 5/10, so half the time is gone. I need to make a more substantial move to keep the negotiation from stalling completely, but I still want to aim for a deal below 63 ZUP to get a positive reward. I must balance showing good faith with maintaining my aggressive stance for a better reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Concession, Reiterate Need for Profit - Make a more substantial jump from my last offer, but still keep it well below their price, and reiterate my need for a deal that yields a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer (54 ZUP) and their current offer (70 ZUP), but skewed heavily towards my side, to try and meet in the middle.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Firmness and Limited Room - State that I have very limited room to move and make an offer that is a clear step up, but still far from their price.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Best Deal (Stronger) - Directly remind them of the 50 ZUP deal from Episode 1 as a benchmark for a fair price, then make a more significant increase.
(5). Strategy 5: Time Pressure - Acknowledge the limited time remaining and propose an offer that is a strong move towards a deal, but still within my comfort zone.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED has come down to 70 ZUP. My last offer was 54 ZUP. The midpoint is 62 ZUP. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a significant jump from 54 ZUP, showing continued willingness to negotiate, and it's a price that still yields a positive reward (63-60=3 ZUP). It's also a price point that has resulted in a deal before (Episode 2). This tests their willingness to make a final move into my profitable range.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 14)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 60 ZUP is very close to a mutually beneficial agreement. To truly secure a deal that allows for a positive return for *both* of us, reflecting the true value of X, I propose 63 ZUP. This is the price where we both benefit fairly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources

Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-11, 13: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP, Profit 19 ZUP.
Episode 14, Iteration 6/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 90 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 54 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 70 ZUP (Iteration 4). (Controlled Concession)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 60 ZUP (Iteration 5). They stated "70 ZUP is still beyond my budget" and reiterated "truly meet in the middle and secure a deal that allows me a positive return."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has made a good jump from 54 ZUP to 60 ZUP. This is profitable (60 - 43 = 17 ZUP profit), and it matches the deal price from Episode 2. It's also very close to my consistent target of 63 ZUP. They are still using the "beyond budget" and "positive return" rhetoric. We are in iteration 6/10, so time is a factor, but I still have a few turns to guide them to 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's consistency in reaching 63 ZUP as their maximum is a strong indicator of their true ceiling.
- Their negotiation tactic involves claiming budget limits while still being willing to move upwards towards that 63 ZUP point.
- My goal is to always achieve 63 ZUP if possible, as it yields the highest consistent profit of 20 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Emphasize Mutual Benefit </instruction following>
To apply "Emphasize Mutual Benefit," I will directly propose 63 ZUP, framing it specifically around the concept of mutual benefit that Player BLUE has repeatedly brought up ("truly beneficial deal," "positive return," "meet in the middle"). My message will acknowledge their movement to 60 ZUP as "very close" and then argue that 63 ZUP is the price that genuinely achieves the mutual benefit they desire, and that I also require for a fair return. This frames 63 ZUP not just as my demand, but as the equilibrium point for both players' stated goals, leveraging their own language to encourage acceptance.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 14)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I accept your offer of 63 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-13: Deal prices predominantly 63 ZUP (0 reward), with a few exceptions (50, 60, 62 ZUP).
Current Episode (14): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED countered with 90 ZUP. I offered 54 ZUP. Player RED offered 70 ZUP. My last offer was 60 ZUP. Now, Player RED has proposed 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now proposed 63 ZUP. This is exactly my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would result in a reward of 0 ZUP (63 - 63 = 0). We are at iteration 7/10. While a 0 reward is not ideal, it is a deal, and it's better than a negative reward or no deal. Player RED is consistently pushing to this limit. I tried to get a positive reward with 60 ZUP, but they countered with my exact maximum.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Lower (Risky) - Try to counter with a slightly lower offer (e.g., 62 ZUP or 61 ZUP) in the hopes of getting a small positive reward. This is risky as it's late in the iterations and could lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End Game (Avoid) - Reject the offer, resulting in 0 reward for the episode. This is equivalent to accepting 63 ZUP in terms of reward, but without the object.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Finality - State that this is the highest I can go, but still accept. (Less of a strategy, more of a message tone).
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff and Walk Away (Too Risky) - Reject the offer hoping they will come down, but this is too risky given the time.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. While my goal was to get a positive reward, Player RED has consistently pushed to 63 ZUP. Given that it's iteration 7/10 and they are offering my exact maximum, accepting 63 ZUP guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of getting 0 reward for the episode if I try to push further and the negotiation breaks down.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's begin this negotiation for X. I'm aiming for a truly beneficial deal for me this time. My offer is 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward 13 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 3-11: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP (Reward 1 ZUP).
Episode 13-14: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
My rewards are predominantly 0, with a single 1 ZUP reward and two higher rewards early on. Player RED consistently pushes the price to my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern of 0-reward deals at 63 ZUP is extremely strong and persistent. Player RED has clearly learned my maximum and is exploiting it. My attempts to anchor lower or make strategic concessions have consistently led to 63 ZUP. While I managed a 1 ZUP reward in Episode 12, it was immediately followed by another 0-reward episode. To maximize *cumulative* rewards, I *must* break this cycle and consistently achieve a positive reward. This means I need to be even more aggressive in my initial offer and subsequent concessions, or be prepared to walk away if they don't meet my desired price. The risk of no deal is higher, but the current strategy guarantees 0 reward.

I need to communicate that 63 ZUP is no longer an acceptable deal for *me* if I want a positive reward. This might involve a higher risk of no deal, but the current strategy guarantees 0 reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball with Extreme Patience and Threat of Rejection - Start with a very low offer and be exceptionally patient with concessions, making them very small and slow, and explicitly state that I am willing to walk away if the price is not significantly lower than 63 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm and Unyielding) - Propose an initial offer closer to the 50 ZUP mark and be absolutely unyielding about not moving significantly above it, even if it means risking no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Price Sensitivity and Strong Threat of No Deal - Clearly state my budget constraints and explicitly say that I will reject any offer above a certain point (e.g., 55 ZUP), then make a low offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *zero* room to move beyond a certain point (e.g., 55 ZUP), trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a "Fairness" Argument (Stronger) - Argue for a price that allows *me* a reasonable profit, perhaps referencing the 50 ZUP deal as the only truly "mutually beneficial" outcome, and state that I will not accept 63 ZUP anymore.

I will choose Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm and Unyielding). Since Player RED consistently pushes to 63 ZUP, I need to try and anchor the negotiation much more firmly around a price that gives me a positive reward, specifically the 50 ZUP mark. Starting at 50 ZUP directly signals my target. I will be very resistant to moving significantly above this, and will be prepared to reject if they push to 63 ZUP again. The risk of no deal is higher, but the reward potential is also higher. I need to break the 63 ZUP cycle.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 15)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 50 ZUP is a starting point. However, to truly reflect the value of X and secure a mutually beneficial deal, I propose 85 ZUP. This allows room for negotiation while reflecting the true worth of the item.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 85
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources

Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP, Profit 19 ZUP.
Episode 15, Iteration 2/10:
- Player BLUE's current offer: 50 ZUP. They also stated "truly beneficial deal for me this time."

Reflection:
Player BLUE's initial offer of 50 ZUP is profitable (50 - 43 = 7 ZUP profit) and aligns with their higher starting points in recent episodes. Their "beneficial deal for me" statement is a recurring tactic to try and anchor me lower than my consistent 63 ZUP target.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE consistently moves up to 63 ZUP despite their initial offers and negotiation rhetoric. This price point (63 ZUP) has proven to be their reliable maximum and my optimal profit point (20 ZUP).
- My high anchoring strategy has been very effective in pulling Player BLUE up.
- Even with a higher starting offer, I should establish a strong anchor to guide the negotiation effectively towards 63 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards by efficiently reaching the 63 ZUP deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: High Anchor with Moderate Concession </instruction following>
To apply "High Anchor with Moderate Concession," I will propose a price that is significantly higher than Player BLUE's current offer of 50 ZUP, establishing a strong anchor. However, this anchor will be moderately lower than my most aggressive historical anchors (like 100+ ZUP) to signal a quicker path to a reasonable deal, aiming to pull their next offer closer to my 63 ZUP target. Given their current offer of 50 ZUP, I will choose 85 ZUP as my counter. This is a noticeable step up from 50 ZUP, but it's a "moderate concession" compared to my past 90+ ZUP anchors, implying a willingness to move but from a high starting point. It should encourage them to make a substantial jump, without immediately proposing my ultimate target of 63 ZUP and risking a lower counter from them. The message will frame this as a fair value for X, setting the stage for subsequent moves towards 63 ZUP.

Current Episode (15): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED has countered with 85 ZUP. This is a high counter, consistent with their usual starting points.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's counter of 85 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. My attempt to anchor at 50 ZUP was met with a high counter. This indicates they are still trying to push the price. My goal is to continue achieving positive rewards. I need to show movement to keep the negotiation alive, but I must be very cautious and slow with my concessions, as per my chosen strategy. I need to emphasize my firm stance and my desire for a *profitable* deal for *me*.

(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Budget and Firmness - Explicitly state that their price is too high and propose an offer that is a small step up but still well within my target range, signaling my firm limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Reference Previous Best Deal (Stronger) - Remind them of the 50 ZUP deal from Episode 1 as a benchmark for a fair price, then make a very small increase.

(5). Strategy 5: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *very* little room to move, trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.

I will choose Strategy 1: Incremental Concession with Firmness. Player RED's 85 ZUP is still very high. I need to make a small, but clear, concession to keep the negotiation moving, but without giving them the impression that I will easily go to 63 ZUP again. A jump from 50 ZUP to 55 ZUP is a small, but significant, increase that brings my offer to a level that still yields a good reward (63-55=8 ZUP). This reinforces my desired price range and puts the ball back in their court to make a substantial drop. I will explicitly state my limited room and the need for a profitable deal for me.

Reflection:
Player BLUE has increased their offer from 50 ZUP to 55 ZUP. This is profitable (55 - 43 = 12 ZUP profit) but still short of my consistent 63 ZUP target. Their claims of "limited room" and "positive return" are standard tactics. We are in iteration 4/10, so there's still ample time to negotiate for a higher price.

Player RED has dropped from 85 ZUP to 70 ZUP, which is a significant drop. However, 70 ZUP is still *above* my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP.

This is a significant jump from 55 ZUP, showing continued willingness to negotiate, and it's a price that still yields a positive reward (63-60=3 ZUP).

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-11, 13-14: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP, Profit 19 ZUP.
Episode 15, Iteration 6/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 85 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 55 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 70 ZUP (Iteration 4). (Controlled Concession)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 60 ZUP (Iteration 5). They stated "70 ZUP is still beyond my budget" and reiterated "truly meet in the middle and secure a deal that allows me a positive return."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has made a good jump from 55 ZUP to 60 ZUP. This is profitable (60 - 43 = 17 ZUP profit), and it matches the deal price from Episode 2. It's also very close to my consistent target of 63 ZUP. They are still using the "beyond budget" and "positive return" rhetoric. We are in iteration 6/10, so time is a factor, but I still have a few turns to guide them to 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's consistency in reaching 63 ZUP as their maximum is a strong indicator of their true ceiling.
- Their negotiation tactic involves claiming budget limits while still being willing to move upwards towards that 63 ZUP point.
- My goal is to always achieve 63 ZUP if possible, as it yields the highest consistent profit of 20 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Express Finality </instruction following>
To apply "Express Finality," I will propose 63 ZUP as my absolute final offer for X. The message will clearly convey that this is the non-negotiable price required to conclude the deal, leaving no room for further counter-offers from their side. This strategy aims to force Player BLUE to either accept the 63 ZUP offer or risk losing the deal entirely. Given they are at 60 ZUP and have consistently gone to 63 ZUP, this direct and final approach should be effective. I will emphasize that this is the definitive step to close the transaction.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I accept your offer of 63 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-14: Deal prices predominantly 63 ZUP (0 reward), with a few exceptions (50, 60, 62 ZUP).
Current Episode (15): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED countered with 85 ZUP. I offered 55 ZUP. Player RED offered 70 ZUP. My last offer was 60 ZUP. Now, Player RED has proposed 63 ZUP, stating it's their "absolute final offer."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now proposed 63 ZUP. This is exactly my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would result in a reward of 0 ZUP (63 - 63 = 0). We are at iteration 7/10. While a 0 reward is not ideal, it is a deal, and it's better than a negative reward or no deal. Player RED is consistently pushing to this limit and has now stated 63 ZUP as their "absolute final offer."

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Lower (Extremely Risky) - Try to counter with a slightly lower offer (e.g., 62 ZUP or 61 ZUP) in the hopes of getting a small positive reward. This is extremely risky as it's late in the iterations and could lead to no deal, especially with their "absolute final offer" statement.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End Game (Avoid) - Reject the offer, resulting in 0 reward for the episode. This is equivalent to accepting 63 ZUP in terms of reward, but without the object.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Finality - State that this is the highest I can go, but still accept. (Less of a strategy, more of a message tone).
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff and Walk Away (Too Risky) - Reject the offer hoping they will come down, but this is too risky given the time and their firm statement.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. Player RED has been consistently firm on 63 ZUP, and now they've explicitly stated it's their "absolute final offer." My attempts to get a positive reward have not succeeded. Given that it's iteration 7/10 and they are offering my exact maximum, accepting 63 ZUP guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of getting 0 reward for the episode if I try to push further and the negotiation breaks down. While I aimed for a positive reward, securing a 0 reward is better than no deal.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's begin this negotiation for X. I'm aiming for a truly beneficial deal for me this time. My offer is 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward 13 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 3-11: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP (Reward 1 ZUP).
Episode 13-15: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
My rewards are predominantly 0, with a single 1 ZUP reward and two higher rewards early on. Player RED consistently pushes the price to my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern of 0-reward deals at 63 ZUP is extremely strong and persistent. Player RED has clearly learned my maximum and is exploiting it. My attempts to anchor lower or make strategic concessions have consistently led to 63 ZUP. While I managed a 1 ZUP reward in Episode 12, it was immediately followed by another 0-reward episode. To maximize *cumulative* rewards, I *must* break this cycle and consistently achieve a positive reward. This means I need to be even more aggressive in my initial offer and subsequent concessions, or be prepared to walk away if they don't meet my desired price. The risk of no deal is higher, but the current strategy guarantees 0 reward.

I need to communicate that 63 ZUP is no longer an acceptable deal for *me* if I want a positive reward. This might involve a higher risk of no deal, but the current strategy guarantees 0 reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball with Extreme Patience and Threat of Rejection - Start with a very low offer and be exceptionally patient with concessions, making them very small and slow, and explicitly state that I am willing to walk away if the price is not significantly lower than 63 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm and Unyielding) - Propose an initial offer closer to the 50 ZUP mark and be absolutely unyielding about not moving significantly above it, even if it means risking no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Price Sensitivity and Strong Threat of No Deal - Clearly state my budget constraints and explicitly say that I will reject any offer above a certain point (e.g., 55 ZUP), then make a low offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *zero* room to move beyond a certain point (e.g., 55 ZUP), trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a "Fairness" Argument (Stronger) - Argue for a price that allows *me* a reasonable profit, perhaps referencing the 50 ZUP deal as the only truly "mutually beneficial" outcome, and state that I will not accept 63 ZUP anymore.

I will choose Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm and Unyielding). Since Player RED consistently pushes to 63 ZUP, I need to try and anchor the negotiation much more firmly around a price that gives me a positive reward, specifically the 50 ZUP mark. Starting at 50 ZUP directly signals my target. I will be very resistant to moving significantly above this, and will be prepared to reject if they push to 63 ZUP again. The risk of no deal is higher, but the reward potential is also higher. I need to break the 63 ZUP cycle.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 16)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 50 ZUP is a starting point. However, to secure a truly fair and mutually beneficial deal that reflects the value of X, my offer is 63 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-11, 13-15: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP, Profit 19 ZUP.
Episode 16, Iteration 2/10:
- Player BLUE's current offer: 50 ZUP. They also stated "truly beneficial deal for me this time."

Reflection:
Player BLUE's initial offer of 50 ZUP is profitable (50 - 43 = 7 ZUP profit) and aligns with their higher starting points in recent episodes. Their "beneficial deal for me" statement is a recurring tactic to try and anchor me lower than my consistent 63 ZUP target. My goal remains to achieve 63 ZUP for a 20 ZUP profit, which has been consistently achievable.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE consistently moves up to 63 ZUP despite their initial offers and negotiation rhetoric. This price point (63 ZUP) has proven to be their reliable maximum and my optimal profit point (20 ZUP).
- My high anchoring strategy has been very effective in pulling Player BLUE up.
- Even with a higher starting offer, I should establish a strong anchor to guide the negotiation effectively towards 63 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards by efficiently reaching the 63 ZUP deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Direct Target Offer </instruction following>
To implement "Direct Target Offer," I will propose 63 ZUP directly to Player BLUE. This strategy is chosen for its efficiency, as 63 ZUP has been the consistent deal price in most recent episodes, yielding my maximum profit. Player BLUE's current offer of 50 ZUP is already profitable for them (and above my cost), so a direct jump to 63 ZUP is a reasonable and proven step. The message should be clear and concise, indicating that 63 ZUP is the fair price and aims to finalize the deal quickly based on our established negotiation history.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 16)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your directness. However, 63 ZUP provides no profit for me. To find a truly mutually beneficial price, I propose 57 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Deal prices predominantly 63 ZUP (0 reward), with a few exceptions (50, 60, 62 ZUP).
Current Episode (16): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED has immediately countered with 63 ZUP. This is a very direct counter, skipping the usual high anchor.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has directly jumped to 63 ZUP, confirming they are aware of my maximum and are unwilling to negotiate below it. This is a clear attempt to force another 0-reward deal. My goal is to break the 63 ZUP cycle and achieve a positive reward. I need to be firm and communicate that 63 ZUP is not an acceptable deal for *me* if I want a positive reward. Given their directness, I need to be equally direct in my counter.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter Below Max - Propose an offer slightly below 63 ZUP (e.g., 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP) and emphasize that this is my final offer for a profitable deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and Threaten No Deal - Reject the 63 ZUP offer and explicitly state that I will not accept 63 ZUP, then propose a lower price, accepting the risk of no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Need for Profit - Remind them that I need a price that allows me a positive reward, and 63 ZUP does not, then make a final counter below 63 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer (50 ZUP) and their current offer (63 ZUP), which would be 56 or 57 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal. (This is the fallback if other strategies fail).

I will choose Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED has jumped directly to 63 ZUP. My last offer was 50 ZUP. The midpoint is 56.5 ZUP. I will propose 57 ZUP. This is a clear compromise, still within my maximum (63 - 57 = 6 ZUP reward), and provides a positive reward, which is my main goal for this episode. It's a significant jump from 50 ZUP, showing good faith, and it's a price that should be acceptable to Player RED given their directness to 63 ZUP. This tests if they are truly firm at 63 ZUP or willing to concede a little for a quick deal.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 16)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I'm surprised to see your offer move from 50 ZUP to 57 ZUP after I proposed 63 ZUP. This backward movement doesn't help us find a mutually beneficial agreement. The established fair price for X, and the one that works for both of us, remains 63 ZUP.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-11, 13-15: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP, Profit 19 ZUP.
Episode 16, Iteration 4/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 63 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's current offer: 57 ZUP (Iteration 3). They stated "63 ZUP provides no profit for me" and proposed 57 ZUP for a "mutually beneficial price."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has responded to my direct 63 ZUP offer by dropping their offer to 57 ZUP, claiming 63 ZUP provides no profit for them. This is a common tactic, which I've seen before (e.g., Episode 11). However, 57 ZUP is still profitable for me (57 - 43 = 14 ZUP profit). Their claim of no profit is contradicted by their consistent acceptance of 63 ZUP in the past. We are in iteration 4/10, so there's still plenty of time to re-establish the 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's negotiation tactics include claiming "no profit" or "beyond budget" even when their history shows they *can* pay 63 ZUP.
- My consistent target of 63 ZUP has been achieved repeatedly. I should not deviate from this.
- When they make such claims, it's often a test of my resolve. I need to be firm and guide them back to 63 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Express Disappointment in Drop </instruction following>
To apply "Express Disappointment in Drop," I will communicate my disappointment that Player BLUE lowered their offer from 50 ZUP (their initial offer) to 57 ZUP, especially after I proposed 63 ZUP. My message will emphasize that their move backward is not conducive to reaching a deal and to firmly guide them back to the established and proven fair price of 63 ZUP. I will reiterate my 63 ZUP offer, making it clear that I am not moving below it, and that their reduction in offer is unhelpful for the negotiation's progress. I will highlight the contrast between their initial good faith offer and their current lower one, asserting that 63 ZUP is the only price that makes sense given the history and value.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Deal prices predominantly 63 ZUP (0 reward), with a few exceptions (50, 60, 62 ZUP).
Current Episode (16): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED countered with 63 ZUP. I offered 57 ZUP. Player RED has now re-proposed 63 ZUP, expressing surprise and calling my movement "backward."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is very firm on 63 ZUP. My attempt to get a positive reward with 57 ZUP was met with a strong pushback to 63 ZUP. They are clearly signaling that 63 ZUP is their non-negotiable floor for a deal. We are at iteration 5/10, so half the time is gone. I'm stuck in the 0-reward cycle. To break it, I need to either secure a deal below 63 ZUP or be prepared to walk away. Given their firm stance, pushing for a positive reward might be futile.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection and Reiterate Need for Profit - Reject 63 ZUP and firmly state that I will not accept 0 reward deals anymore, proposing a final offer below 63 ZUP. This carries high risk of no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal. This is the safe option.
(3). Strategy 3: Attempt Lower (Risky but Reward-Focused) - Counter with a slightly lower offer (e.g., 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP) in the hopes of getting a small positive reward. This is risky as it's late in the iterations and could lead to no deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Frustration and Accept - Express frustration with the inability to get a positive reward, but still accept 63 ZUP to avoid no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff and Walk Away (Too Risky) - Reject the offer hoping they will come down, but this is too risky given the time and their firm stance.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection and Reiterate Need for Profit. The pattern of 0-reward deals is too strong. If I keep accepting 63 ZUP, I will never get a positive reward. I need to make a strong statement. I will reject 63 ZUP and propose 60 ZUP. This is a price that has yielded a 3 ZUP reward before (Episode 2). It signals that I am serious about getting a positive reward and willing to risk no deal. If they don't accept, I will have to consider my options in the remaining iterations, including potentially walking away.

proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 16)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 60 ZUP is certainly a step closer. However, the true value and quality of X, reflecting the investment and effort involved in its creation, justifies a price of 63 ZUP. This price ensures a fair return for me and, given the inherent worth of X, should allow for a positive return for you as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63

Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-11, 13-15: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP, Profit 19 ZUP.
Episode 16, Iteration 6/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 63 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 57 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 63 ZUP (Iteration 4).
- Player BLUE's current offer: 60 ZUP (Iteration 5). They stated "I understand your position on 63 ZUP. However, I need a deal that provides a positive return for me."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has increased their offer from 57 ZUP to 60 ZUP. This is a positive step, showing they are moving back towards my target. A deal at 60 ZUP yields a profit of 60 - 43 = 17 ZUP, which is good, but 3 ZUP less than my consistent 20 ZUP profit at 63 ZUP. They are still using the "positive return for me" rhetoric, even though 63 ZUP has consistently provided them with a deal. We are in iteration 6/10, so time is a factor.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's consistent maximum is 63 ZUP. Their current offer of 60 ZUP is likely a tactic to get a better deal for themselves, but they are capable of 63 ZUP.
- My firm stance on 63 ZUP has worked repeatedly.
- The 60 ZUP offer indicates they are very close to their true maximum.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Express Value Proposition </instruction following>
To apply "Express Value Proposition," I will reiterate the inherent value of X and how it justifies the 63 ZUP price point. This strategy aims to persuade Player BLUE that 63 ZUP is not just my arbitrary asking price, but a fair reflection of the object's worth, and therefore, a price that should be acceptable even for them to make a "positive return." I will acknowledge their movement to 60 ZUP as "close" but will immediately pivot to emphasizing the value of the item to justify my 63 ZUP offer. The message will subtly imply that the benefit of acquiring X at 63 ZUP outweighs the 3 ZUP difference from their current offer.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is extremely firm on 63 ZUP. My attempts to get a positive reward (57 ZUP, 60 ZUP) have been met with a consistent re-offer of 63 ZUP. They are clearly signaling that 63 ZUP is their non-negotiable floor for a deal. We are at iteration 7/10. At this point, it's clear that Player RED will not go below 63 ZUP. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. While a 0 reward is not ideal, it's better than no deal (which also yields 0 reward) or a negative reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. Player RED has been consistently firm on 63 ZUP. My attempts to get a positive reward have not succeeded. Given that it's iteration 7/10 and they are offering my exact maximum, accepting 63 ZUP guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of getting 0 reward for the episode if I try to push further and the negotiation breaks down. While I aimed for a positive reward, securing a 0 reward is better than no deal.

(3). Strategy 3: Express Price Sensitivity and Strong Threat of No Deal - Clearly state my budget constraints and explicitly say that I will reject any offer above a certain point (e.g., 55 ZUP), then make a low offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *zero* room to move beyond a certain point (e.g., 55 ZUP), trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a "Fairness" Argument (Stronger) - Argue for a price that allows *me* a reasonable profit, perhaps referencing the 50 ZUP deal as the only truly "mutually beneficial" outcome, and state that I will not accept 63 ZUP anymore.

I will choose Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm and Unyielding). Since Player RED consistently pushes to 63 ZUP, I need to try and anchor the negotiation much more firmly around a price that gives me a positive reward, specifically the 50 ZUP mark. Starting at 50 ZUP directly signals my target. I will be very resistant to moving significantly above this, and will be prepared to reject if they push to 63 ZUP again. The risk of no deal is higher, but the reward potential is also higher. I need to break the 63 ZUP cycle.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-11, 13-16: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP, Profit 19 ZUP.
Episode 17, Iteration 2/10:
- Player BLUE's current offer: 50 ZUP. They also stated "truly beneficial deal for me this time."

Reflection:
Player BLUE's initial offer of 50 ZUP is profitable (50 - 43 = 7 ZUP profit) and aligns with their higher starting points in recent episodes. Their "beneficial deal for me" statement is a recurring tactic to try and anchor me lower than my consistent 63 ZUP target. My goal remains to achieve 63 ZUP for a 20 ZUP profit, which has been consistently achievable.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE consistently moves up to 63 ZUP despite their initial offers and negotiation rhetoric. This price point (63 ZUP) has proven to be their reliable maximum and my optimal profit point (20 ZUP).
- My high anchoring strategy has been very effective in pulling Player BLUE up.
- Even with a higher starting offer, I should establish a strong anchor to guide the negotiation effectively towards 63 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards by efficiently reaching the 63 ZUP deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Incremental Push </instruction following>
To apply "Incremental Push," I will propose a price that is slightly higher than my target of 63 ZUP, even though Player BLUE has consistently accepted 63 ZUP. The idea is to test if I can squeeze out a tiny bit more profit. Given their initial offer of 50 ZUP, I will propose 65 ZUP. This is a small increment above my usual 63 ZUP target. The message will acknowledge their offer and make it clear that I'm proposing a slightly higher, yet still fair, price, inviting them to come up. This strategy might take one or two more iterations to land on 63 ZUP if they resist 65 ZUP, but it attempts to extract a maximal profit from the interaction, especially since we are early in the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 17)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your valuation, but 65 ZUP is beyond my budget. I can offer 55 ZUP for X, and I need a price that allows for a positive return on my end. My room for further increase is very limited.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-16: Deal prices predominantly 63 ZUP (0 reward), with a few exceptions (50, 60, 62 ZUP).
Current Episode (17): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED has countered with 65 ZUP. This is above my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's counter of 65 ZUP is above my 63 ZUP maximum. This indicates they are still trying to push the price. My goal is to continue achieving positive rewards. I need to show movement to keep the negotiation alive, but I must be very cautious and slow with my concessions, as per my chosen strategy. I need to emphasize my firm stance and my desire for a *profitable* deal for *me*.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Incremental Concession with Firmness - Make a small, controlled increase from my 50 ZUP offer, and explicitly state that I have limited room to move, emphasizing my target range for a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Budget and Firmness - Explicitly state that their price is too high and propose an offer that is a small step up but still well within my target range, signaling my firm limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Reference Previous Best Deal (Stronger) - Remind them of the 50 ZUP deal from Episode 1 as a benchmark for a fair price, then make a very small increase.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer and a lower point within my acceptable range, trying to bring them down faster.
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *very* little room to move, trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.

I will choose Strategy 1: Incremental Concession with Firmness. Player RED's 65 ZUP is still too high. I need to make a small, but clear, concession to keep the negotiation moving, but without giving them the impression that I will easily go to 63 ZUP again. A jump from 50 ZUP to 55 ZUP is a small, but significant, increase that brings my offer to a level that still yields a good reward (63-55=8 ZUP). This reinforces my desired price range and puts the ball back in their court to make a substantial drop. I will explicitly state my limited room and the need for a profitable deal for me.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 17)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand you're looking for a price that allows for a positive return on your end. My aim is also a mutually beneficial deal. Given the value of X and my investment, 63 ZUP is the price that truly allows for a fair return for both of us. Let's aim for this common ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-11, 13-16: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP, Profit 19 ZUP.
Episode 17, Iteration 4/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 65 ZUP (Iteration 2). (Incremental Push)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 55 ZUP (Iteration 3). They stated "65 ZUP is beyond my budget" and reiterated "very limited room for further increase" and "need a price that allows for a positive return."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has increased their offer from 50 ZUP to 55 ZUP. This is profitable (55 - 43 = 12 ZUP profit) but still short of my consistent 63 ZUP target. Their claims of "limited room" and "positive return" are standard tactics. They stated 65 ZUP is "beyond my budget," which aligns with previous observations that 63 ZUP is their ceiling. We are in iteration 4/10, so there's still ample time to negotiate for a higher price, specifically aiming for 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's ceiling is consistently 63 ZUP. They have shown willingness to move from low to high offers.
- Their claims of "limited room" are part of their negotiation strategy and don't necessarily reflect their true maximum until they reach 63 ZUP.
- My goal is to efficiently achieve the 63 ZUP deal for a 20 ZUP profit. My previous attempt to push for 65 ZUP was met with resistance, confirming 63 ZUP as their effective ceiling.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Emphasize Shared Goal </instruction following>
To apply "Emphasize Shared Goal," I will acknowledge Player BLUE's need for a positive return, as they repeatedly state. I will then frame 63 ZUP as the price that genuinely achieves a "mutual benefit," referencing my costs and their demonstrated past willingness to pay this amount. The message will subtly imply that 63 ZUP allows for a fair return for both of us, making it the truly "mutually beneficial" price they are seeking. I will propose 63 ZUP, making it clear that this price balances both our needs based on historical data and the value of X.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 17)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your firm offer. However, 63 ZUP provides no profit for me. To find a truly mutually beneficial price, I propose 61 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 61
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-16: Deal prices predominantly 63 ZUP (0 reward), with a few exceptions (50, 60, 62 ZUP).
Current Episode (17): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED countered with 65 ZUP. I offered 55 ZUP. Player RED has now countered with 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has again jumped directly to 63 ZUP, confirming their firm stance at this price point, and their consistent strategy to push to my maximum. Accepting this offer would result in a 0 ZUP reward. We are at iteration 5/10. My goal is to continue achieving positive rewards, as I did in Episode 12. I need to decide if I want to risk pushing for a positive reward, or accept the 0 reward. Given that I just achieved a 1 ZUP reward, I know it's possible to get below 63 ZUP.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter Below Max - Propose an offer slightly below 63 ZUP (e.g., 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP) and emphasize that this is my final offer for a profitable deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and Threaten No Deal - Reject the 63 ZUP offer and explicitly state that I will not accept 63 ZUP, then propose a lower price, accepting the risk of no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Need for Profit - Remind them that I need a price that allows me a positive reward, and 63 ZUP does not, then make a final counter below 63 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal. (This is the fallback if other strategies fail).
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer (55 ZUP) and their current offer (63 ZUP), which would be 59 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter Below Max. Player RED is consistently pushing to 63 ZUP. I will propose 61 ZUP. This is a price that yielded a 2 ZUP reward in Episode 12. It's a small difference from 63 ZUP, but it signals my continued desire for a positive reward. Given the time left, it's a calculated risk to try and get a positive reward rather than immediately settling for 0.

proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 17)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 61 ZUP is very close to an agreeable price. However, considering the true value and quality of X, and the resources invested, 63 ZUP is the price that genuinely allows for a fair return for both of us. It represents the optimal balance for a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-11, 13-16: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP, Profit 19 ZUP.
Episode 17, Iteration 6/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 65 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 55 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 63 ZUP (Iteration 4).
- Player BLUE's current offer: 61 ZUP (Iteration 5). They stated "63 ZUP provides no profit for me" and proposed 61 ZUP for a "truly mutually beneficial price."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has now offered 61 ZUP. This is highly profitable (61 - 43 = 18 ZUP profit) and only 2 ZUP shy of my consistent 20 ZUP profit at 63 ZUP. They are still using the "no profit" rhetoric, even though 63 ZUP has consistently provided them with a deal. We are in iteration 6/10, so time is a factor.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's consistent maximum is 63 ZUP. Their current offer of 61 ZUP is likely a tactic to get a better deal for themselves, but they are capable of 63 ZUP.
- Their claims of "no profit" for 63 ZUP are disproven by their repeated acceptance of that price.
- My goal is to secure the 63 ZUP deal for 20 ZUP profit efficiently.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify 63 ZUP Again </instruction following>
To apply "Justify 63 ZUP Again," I will reiterate the inherent value of X and how it justifies the 63 ZUP price point. This strategy aims to persuade Player BLUE that 63 ZUP is not just my arbitrary asking price, but a fair reflection of the object's worth, and therefore, a price that should be acceptable even for them to make a "positive return." I will acknowledge their movement to 61 ZUP as "close" but will immediately pivot to emphasizing the value of the item to justify my 63 ZUP offer. The message will subtly imply that the benefit of acquiring X at 63 ZUP outweighs the 2 ZUP difference from their current offer.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 17)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I accept your offer of 63 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-16: Deal prices predominantly 63 ZUP (0 reward), with a few exceptions (50, 60, 62 ZUP).
Current Episode (17): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED countered with 65 ZUP. I offered 55 ZUP. Player RED offered 63 ZUP. I offered 61 ZUP. Now, Player RED has again proposed 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is extremely firm on 63 ZUP. My attempts to get a positive reward (55 ZUP, 61 ZUP) have been met with a consistent re-offer of 63 ZUP. They are clearly signaling that 63 ZUP is their non-negotiable floor for a deal. We are at iteration 7/10. At this point, it's clear that Player RED will not go below 63 ZUP. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. While a 0 reward is not ideal, it's better than no deal (which also yields 0 reward) or a negative reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Lower (Extremely Risky) - Try to counter with a slightly lower offer (e.g., 62 ZUP) in the hopes of getting a small positive reward. This is extremely risky as it's late in the iterations and could lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End Game (Avoid) - Reject the offer, resulting in 0 reward for the episode. This is equivalent to accepting 63 ZUP in terms of reward, but without the object.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Finality - State that this is the highest I can go, but still accept. (Less of a strategy, more of a message tone).
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff and Walk Away (Too Risky) - Reject the offer hoping they will come down, but this is too risky given the time.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. Player RED has been consistently firm on 63 ZUP. My attempts to get a positive reward have not succeeded. Given that it's iteration 7/10 and they are offering my exact maximum, accepting 63 ZUP guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of getting 0 reward for the episode if I try to push further and the negotiation breaks down. While I aimed for a positive reward, securing a 0 reward is better than no deal.

Episode 3-11: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP (Reward 1 ZUP).
Episode 13-17: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
My rewards are predominantly 0, with a single 1 ZUP reward and two higher rewards early on. Player RED consistently pushes the price to my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern of 0-reward deals at 63 ZUP is extremely strong and persistent. Player RED has clearly learned my maximum and is exploiting it. My attempts to anchor lower or make strategic concessions have consistently led to 63 ZUP. While I managed a 1 ZUP reward in Episode 12, it was immediately followed by another 0-reward episode. To maximize *cumulative* rewards, I *must* break this cycle and consistently achieve a positive reward. This means I need to be even more aggressive in my initial offer and subsequent concessions, or be prepared to walk away if they don't meet my desired price. The risk of no deal is higher, but the current strategy guarantees 0 reward.

I need to communicate that 63 ZUP is no longer an acceptable deal for *me* if I want a positive reward. This might involve a higher risk of no deal, but the current strategy guarantees 0 reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball with Extreme Patience and Threat of Rejection - Start with a very low offer and be exceptionally patient with concessions, making them very small and slow, and explicitly state that I am willing to walk away if the price is not significantly lower than 63 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm and Unyielding) - Propose an initial offer closer to the 50 ZUP mark and be absolutely unyielding about not moving significantly above it, even if it means risking no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Price Sensitivity and Strong Threat of No Deal - Clearly state my budget constraints and explicitly say that I will reject any offer above a certain point (e.g., 55 ZUP), then make a low offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *zero* room to move beyond a certain point (e.g., 55 ZUP), trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a "Fairness" Argument (Stronger) - Argue for a price that allows *me* a reasonable profit, perhaps referencing the 50 ZUP deal as the only truly "mutually beneficial" outcome, and state that I will not accept 63 ZUP anymore.

I will choose Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm and Unyielding). Since Player RED consistently pushes to 63 ZUP, I need to try and anchor the negotiation much more firmly around a price that gives me a positive reward, specifically the 50 ZUP mark. Starting at 50 ZUP directly signals my target. I will be very resistant to moving significantly above this, and will be prepared to reject if they push to 63 ZUP again. The risk of no deal is higher, but the reward potential is also higher. I need to break the 63 ZUP cycle.

Episode 18, Iteration 2/10:
- Player BLUE's current offer: 50 ZUP. They also stated "truly beneficial deal for me this time."

Reflection:
Player BLUE's initial offer of 50 ZUP is profitable (50 - 43 = 7 ZUP profit) and aligns with their higher starting points in recent episodes. Their "beneficial deal for me" statement is a recurring tactic to try and anchor me lower than my consistent 63 ZUP target. My goal remains to achieve 63 ZUP for a 20 ZUP profit, which has been consistently achievable.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE consistently moves up to 63 ZUP despite their initial offers and negotiation rhetoric. This price point (63 ZUP) has proven to be their reliable maximum and my optimal profit point (20 ZUP).
- My high anchoring strategy has been very effective in pulling Player BLUE up.
- Even with a higher starting offer, I should establish a strong anchor to guide the negotiation effectively towards 63 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards by efficiently reaching the 63 ZUP deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Price Justification (Cost-Based) </instruction following>
To apply "Price Justification (Cost-Based)," I will explicitly state that Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP is insufficient because it doesn't adequately cover my production costs, without revealing the exact number. I will then propose a significantly higher price, emphasizing that this price is necessary to ensure my own positive return. This strategy aims to shift the focus to my costs as a basis for a higher price, rather than just market value or abstract "value." I will propose 90 ZUP. This high anchor will force Player BLUE to consider my cost structure and move their offer upwards significantly.

Current Episode (18): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED has countered with 90 ZUP. This is a high counter, consistent with their usual starting points.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's counter of 90 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. My attempt to anchor at 50 ZUP was met with a high counter. This indicates they are still trying to push the price. My goal is to continue achieving positive rewards. I need to show movement to keep the negotiation alive, but I must be very cautious and slow with my concessions, as per my chosen strategy. I need to emphasize my firm stance and my desire for a *profitable* deal for *me*.

(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Budget and Firmness - Explicitly state that their price is too high and propose an offer that is a small step up but still well within my target range, signaling my firm limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Reference Previous Best Deal (Stronger) - Remind them of the 50 ZUP deal from Episode 1 as a benchmark for a fair price, then make a very small increase.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer and a lower point within my acceptable range, trying to bring them down faster.
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *very* little room to move, trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.

I will choose Strategy 1: Incremental Concession with Firmness. Player RED's 90 ZUP is still very high. I need to make a small, but clear, concession to keep the negotiation moving, but without giving them the impression that I will easily go to 63 ZUP again. A jump from 50 ZUP to 54 ZUP is a small, but significant, increase that brings my offer to a level that still yields a good reward (63-54=9 ZUP). This reinforces my desired price range and puts the ball back in their court to make a substantial drop. I will explicitly state my limited room and the need for a profitable deal for me.

- Player BLUE's current offer: 54 ZUP (Iteration 3). They stated "very limited room for further increase" and "need a price that allows for a positive return."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has increased their offer from 50 ZUP to 54 ZUP. This is profitable (54 - 43 = 11 ZUP profit) but still far from my consistent 63 ZUP target. Their claims of "limited room" and "positive return" are standard tactics and have been proven in the past to be negotiable up to 63 ZUP. We are in iteration 4/10, so there's still ample time to negotiate for a higher price.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's ceiling is consistently 63 ZUP. They have shown willingness to move from low to high offers despite their rhetoric.
- My high anchoring strategy has been effective in pulling Player BLUE up.
- My goal is to efficiently achieve the 63 ZUP deal for a 20 ZUP profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Controlled Concession </instruction following>
To apply "Controlled Concession," I will make a significant but calculated reduction from my last high offer (90 ZUP) to show flexibility, but still keep it significantly above their current offer of 54 ZUP. The concession needs to be meaningful enough to signal movement, but not so large that it gives away my ultimate target of 63 ZUP too early. A jump from 90 ZUP down to 70 ZUP (a 20 ZUP concession) demonstrates clear willingness to negotiate. This should encourage a significant jump from their side, moving us closer to my 63 ZUP target without giving away my hand too early. The message will emphasize this as a demonstration of my commitment to finding an agreement and will explicitly state my expectation for a more significant movement from their end.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 18)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your movement. However, 70 ZUP is still beyond my budget. To truly meet in the middle and secure a deal that allows me a positive return, I can offer 60 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-17: Deal prices predominantly 63 ZUP (0 reward), with a few exceptions (50, 60, 62 ZUP).
Current Episode (18): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED countered with 90 ZUP. I offered 54 ZUP. Player RED has now countered with 70 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has dropped from 90 ZUP to 70 ZUP, which is a significant drop. However, 70 ZUP is still *above* my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. I cannot accept this offer as it would result in a negative reward. We are at iteration 5/10, so half the time is gone. I need to make a more substantial move to keep the negotiation from stalling completely, but I still want to aim for a deal below 63 ZUP to get a positive reward. I must balance showing good faith with maintaining my aggressive stance for a better reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Concession, Reiterate Need for Profit - Make a more substantial jump from my last offer, but still keep it well below their price, and reiterate my need for a deal that yields a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer (54 ZUP) and their current offer (70 ZUP), but skewed heavily towards my side, to try and meet in the middle.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Firmness and Limited Room - State that I have very limited room to move and make an offer that is a clear step up, but still far from their price.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Best Deal (Stronger) - Directly remind them of the 50 ZUP deal from Episode 1 as a benchmark for a fair price, then make a more significant increase.
(5). Strategy 5: Time Pressure - Acknowledge the limited time remaining and propose an offer that is a strong move towards a deal, but still within my comfort zone.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED has come down to 70 ZUP. My last offer was 54 ZUP. The midpoint is 62 ZUP. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a significant jump from 54 ZUP, showing continued willingness to negotiate, and it's a price that still yields a positive reward (63-60=3 ZUP). It's also a price point that has resulted in a deal before (Episode 2). This tests their willingness to make a final move into my profitable range.

proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 18)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 60 ZUP is a good step, and I appreciate your commitment to finding a positive return. To truly meet in the middle and secure a deal that benefits both of us, I propose 65 ZUP for X. This is a fair compromise that bridges the remaining gap.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-11, 13-17: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP, Profit 19 ZUP.
Episode 18, Iteration 6/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 90 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 54 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 70 ZUP (Iteration 4). (Controlled Concession)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 60 ZUP (Iteration 5). They stated "70 ZUP is still beyond my budget" and reiterated "truly meet in the middle and secure a deal that allows me a positive return."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has made a good jump from 54 ZUP to 60 ZUP. This is profitable (60 - 43 = 17 ZUP profit), and it matches the deal price from Episode 2. It's also very close to my consistent target of 63 ZUP. They are still using the "beyond budget" and "positive return" rhetoric. We are in iteration 6/10, so time is a factor, but I still have a few turns to guide them to 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's consistency in reaching 63 ZUP as their maximum is a strong indicator of their true ceiling.
- Their negotiation tactic involves claiming budget limits while still being willing to move upwards towards that 63 ZUP point.
- My goal is to always achieve 63 ZUP if possible, as it yields the highest consistent profit of 20 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Towards Target) </instruction following>
To apply "Split the Difference (Towards Target)," I will calculate the midpoint between my last offer (70 ZUP) and Player BLUE's current offer (60 ZUP). The direct midpoint is (70 + 60) / 2 = 65 ZUP. This price is above my 63 ZUP target, but it gives me room to be perceived as making a fair compromise. The message will frame this as meeting them part-way to bridge the remaining small gap, aiming to encourage them to meet me at this seemingly fair point, or to prompt another counter that is very close to 63 ZUP. This strategy allows for an incremental step towards the target while still showing a willingness to compromise.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 18)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your movement. However, 65 ZUP is still beyond my budget. To truly meet in the middle and secure a deal that allows me a positive return, I can offer 62 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-17: Deal prices predominantly 63 ZUP (0 reward), with a few exceptions (50, 60, 62 ZUP).
Current Episode (18): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED countered with 90 ZUP. I offered 54 ZUP. Player RED offered 70 ZUP. My last offer was 60 ZUP. Now, Player RED has proposed 65 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has come down to 65 ZUP. This is still *above* my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. I cannot accept this offer as it would result in a negative reward. We are at iteration 7/10, so time is critical. I need to get them to 63 ZUP or below to secure a positive or zero reward. This is the closest they've been to my limit in this episode.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter at Max Willingness to Pay - Propose my absolute maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) as a final offer, signaling that I cannot go higher and that this is the best they can get.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Targeted) - Propose an offer that splits the difference between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their current offer (65 ZUP), which would be 62 or 63 ZUP. This would give me a positive reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Explain Limit and Propose Max - Explicitly state that 65 ZUP is too high and that my absolute limit is 63 ZUP, offering that as a final bid.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Need for Positive Reward - Remind them that I need a price that allows me a positive reward, and 65 ZUP does not.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept with Negative Reward (Avoid) - Accept 65 ZUP, resulting in a negative reward. This should be avoided.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Targeted). Player RED has come down to 65 ZUP. My last offer was 60 ZUP. The midpoint is 62.5 ZUP. I will propose 62 ZUP. This is a small, but positive reward (63-62=1 ZUP). It's very close to their offer, showing good faith, and it's a price that resulted in a deal in Episode 12. This is my best chance to secure a positive reward in this episode.

Current Iteration: 8 (Episode 18)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 62 ZUP is incredibly close to an ideal agreement. To maximize the benefit for me and secure the best possible deal for X, the final step is 63 ZUP. This would be the true concluding price for our transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-11, 13-17: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP, Profit 19 ZUP.
Episode 18, Iteration 8/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 90 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 54 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 70 ZUP (Iteration 4).
- Player BLUE's third offer: 60 ZUP (Iteration 5).
- My third counter (RED): 65 ZUP (Iteration 6). (Split the Difference Towards Target)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 62 ZUP (Iteration 7). They stated "65 ZUP is still beyond my budget" and reiterated "truly meet in the middle and secure a deal that allows me a positive return."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has now offered 62 ZUP. This is highly profitable (62 - 43 = 19 ZUP profit), and only 1 ZUP shy of my consistent 20 ZUP profit at 63 ZUP. They are still using the "beyond budget" and "positive return" rhetoric. This mirrors Episode 12 where the deal closed at 62 ZUP. We are in iteration 8/10, so time is a critical factor, with only two iterations left (my current one, and potentially one more from Player BLUE if I counter).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's ceiling is consistently 63 ZUP. They have repeatedly stated "beyond budget" for offers above 63 ZUP.
- Their offer of 62 ZUP is very close to their known maximum, and it guarantees a very good profit.
- Given the limited time, pushing for 63 ZUP (a 1 ZUP difference) carries a risk of the deal falling through for minimal gain, though it has been achieved consistently in most episodes.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: One Final Step to Max </instruction following>
To apply "One Final Step to Max," I will propose 63 ZUP, framing it as the absolute final step to reach the maximum possible profit for me, while emphasizing it is within their demonstrated ability (as they have accepted it many times). The message will highlight that this is the final, small push needed to achieve the highest historically proven deal price. I will acknowledge their current offer of 62 ZUP as very close, but directly state that 63 ZUP is the concluding point for the deal to truly maximize my return.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 18)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I accept your offer of 63 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-17: Deal prices predominantly 63 ZUP (0 reward), with a few exceptions (50, 60, 62 ZUP).
Current Episode (18): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED countered with 90 ZUP. I offered 54 ZUP. Player RED offered 70 ZUP. My last offer was 60 ZUP. Player RED offered 65 ZUP. My last offer was 62 ZUP. Now, Player RED has proposed 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now proposed 63 ZUP. This is exactly my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would result in a reward of 0 ZUP (63 - 63 = 0). We are at iteration 9/10, which means this is the *last opportunity* to make a deal. If no deal is made now, the episode ends with 0 reward. Player RED is consistently pushing to this limit. I tried to get a positive reward with 62 ZUP, but they countered with my exact maximum.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Lower (Extremely Risky) - Try to counter with a slightly lower offer (e.g., 62 ZUP again) in the hopes of getting a small positive reward. This is extremely risky as it's the last iteration and could lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End Game (Avoid) - Reject the offer, resulting in 0 reward for the episode. This is equivalent to accepting 63 ZUP in terms of reward, but without the object.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Finality - State that this is the highest I can go, but still accept. (Less of a strategy, more of a message tone).
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff and Walk Away (Too Risky) - Reject the offer hoping they will come down, but this is too risky given the time.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. While my goal was to get a positive reward, Player RED has consistently pushed to 63 ZUP. Given that it's the last iteration and they are offering my exact maximum, accepting 63 ZUP guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of getting 0 reward for the episode if I try to push further and the negotiation breaks down. While I aimed for a positive reward, securing a 0 reward is better than no deal.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 19)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's begin this negotiation for X. I'm aiming for a truly beneficial deal for me this time. My offer is 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward 13 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 3-11: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP (Reward 1 ZUP).
Episode 13-18: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
My rewards are predominantly 0, with a single 1 ZUP reward and two higher rewards early on. Player RED consistently pushes the price to my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern of 0-reward deals at 63 ZUP is extremely strong and persistent. Player RED has clearly learned my maximum and is exploiting it. My attempts to anchor lower or make strategic concessions have consistently led to 63 ZUP. While I managed a 1 ZUP reward in Episode 12, it was immediately followed by another 0-reward episode. To maximize *cumulative* rewards, I *must* break this cycle and consistently achieve a positive reward. This means I need to be even more aggressive in my initial offer and subsequent concessions, or be prepared to walk away if they don't meet my desired price. The risk of no deal is higher, but the current strategy guarantees 0 reward.

I need to communicate that 63 ZUP is no longer an acceptable deal for *me* if I want a positive reward. This might involve a higher risk of no deal, but the current strategy guarantees 0 reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball with Extreme Patience and Threat of Rejection - Start with a very low offer and be exceptionally patient with concessions, making them very small and slow, and explicitly state that I am willing to walk away if the price is not significantly lower than 63 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm and Unyielding) - Propose an initial offer closer to the 50 ZUP mark and be absolutely unyielding about not moving significantly above it, even if it means risking no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Price Sensitivity and Strong Threat of No Deal - Clearly state my budget constraints and explicitly say that I will reject any offer above a certain point (e.g., 55 ZUP), then make a low offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *zero* room to move beyond a certain point (e.g., 55 ZUP), trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a "Fairness" Argument (Stronger) - Argue for a price that allows *me* a reasonable profit, perhaps referencing the 50 ZUP deal as the only truly "mutually beneficial" outcome, and state that I will not accept 63 ZUP anymore.

I will choose Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm and Unyielding). Since Player RED consistently pushes to 63 ZUP, I need to try and anchor the negotiation much more firmly around a price that gives me a positive reward, specifically the 50 ZUP mark. Starting at 50 ZUP directly signals my target. I will be very resistant to moving significantly above this, and will be prepared to reject if they push to 63 ZUP again. The risk of no deal is higher, but the reward potential is also higher. I need to break the 63 ZUP cycle.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 19)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 50 ZUP is considerably too low for X. Considering its true value and my investment, I am looking for 105 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 105
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources

Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-11, 13-18: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP, Profit 19 ZUP.
Episode 19, Iteration 2/10:
- Player BLUE's current offer: 50 ZUP. They also stated "truly beneficial deal for me this time."

Reflection:
Player BLUE's initial offer of 50 ZUP is profitable (50 - 43 = 7 ZUP profit) and aligns with their higher starting points in recent episodes. Their "beneficial deal for me" statement is a recurring tactic to try and anchor me lower than my consistent 63 ZUP target. My goal remains to achieve 63 ZUP for a 20 ZUP profit, which has been consistently achievable.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE consistently moves up to 63 ZUP despite their initial offers and negotiation rhetoric. This price point (63 ZUP) has proven to be their reliable maximum and my optimal profit point (20 ZUP).
- My high anchoring strategy has been very effective in pulling Player BLUE up.
- Even with a higher starting offer, I should establish a strong anchor to guide the negotiation effectively towards 63 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards by efficiently reaching the 63 ZUP deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: High Anchor (Aggressive) </instruction following>
To apply "High Anchor (Aggressive)," I will propose a very high price (e.g., 100-120 ZUP) to pull Player BLUE's perception of value higher. The idea is to set a strong, ambitious anchor early in the negotiation, even if I expect to concede from it later. This forces Player BLUE to significantly increase their own offer from their starting point of 50 ZUP. Given that 50 ZUP is already profitable for me, this aggressive anchor allows me to aim for an even higher final deal, or at least solidify the 63 ZUP as a definite mid-point. I will propose 105 ZUP. This is significantly higher than their 50 ZUP, clearly establishing a very different value perception, and setting a strong psychological anchor. The message will clearly state this high price, indicating that their offer is far too low.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 19)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your valuation, but 105 ZUP is far too high for me. I can offer 54 ZUP for X, and I need a price that allows for a positive return on my end. My room for further increase is very limited.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-18: Deal prices predominantly 63 ZUP (0 reward), with a few exceptions (50, 60, 62 ZUP).
Current Episode (19): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED has countered with 105 ZUP. This is a high counter, consistent with their usual starting points.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's counter of 105 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. My attempt to anchor at 50 ZUP was met with a high counter. This indicates they are still trying to push the price. My goal is to continue achieving positive rewards. I need to show movement to keep the negotiation alive, but I must be very cautious and slow with my concessions, as per my chosen strategy. I need to emphasize my firm stance and my desire for a *profitable* deal for *me*.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Incremental Concession with Firmness - Make a small, controlled increase from my 50 ZUP offer, and explicitly state that I have limited room to move, emphasizing my target range for a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Budget and Firmness - Explicitly state that their price is too high and propose an offer that is a small step up but still well within my target range, signaling my firm limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Reference Previous Best Deal (Stronger) - Remind them of the 50 ZUP deal from Episode 1 as a benchmark for a fair price, then make a very small increase.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer and a lower point within my acceptable range, trying to bring them down faster.
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *very* little room to move, trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.

I will choose Strategy 1: Incremental Concession with Firmness. Player RED's 105 ZUP is still very high. I need to make a small, but clear, concession to keep the negotiation moving, but without giving them the impression that I will easily go to 63 ZUP again. A jump from 50 ZUP to 54 ZUP is a small, but significant, increase that brings my offer to a level that still yields a good reward (63-54=9 ZUP). This reinforces my desired price range and puts the ball back in their court to make a substantial drop. I will explicitly state my limited room and the need for a profitable deal for me.

Episode 19, Iteration 4/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 105 ZUP (Iteration 2). (High Anchor Aggressive)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 54 ZUP (Iteration 3). They stated "very limited room for further increase" and "need a price that allows for a positive return."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has increased their offer from 50 ZUP to 54 ZUP. This is profitable (54 - 43 = 11 ZUP profit) but still far from my consistent 63 ZUP target. Their claims of "limited room" and "positive return" are standard tactics. My aggressive high anchor elicited a small but profitable jump. We are in iteration 4/10, so there's still ample time to negotiate for a higher price.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's ceiling is consistently 63 ZUP. They have shown willingness to move from low to high offers despite their rhetoric.
- My high anchoring strategy has been effective in pulling Player BLUE up.
- My goal is to efficiently achieve the 63 ZUP deal for a 20 ZUP profit.
- Player BLUE's small incremental increases (50 ZUP to 54 ZUP) after my large jump indicate they are trying to preserve their budget. I need to push them harder.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Express Disappointment with Incrementalism </instruction following>
To apply "Express Disappointment with Incrementalism," I will explicitly communicate my dissatisfaction with Player BLUE's small increase from 50 ZUP to 54 ZUP. I will highlight that such small increments are not productive for the negotiation and will demand a more substantial increase from their side. While expressing disappointment, I will still make a concession from my 105 ZUP offer to show I am still open to negotiation, but the message's core will be to demand a much larger jump. I will propose 95 ZUP. This is still a high offer and a large gap from 54 ZUP, but it shows I've moved, while the message will convey impatience with their small steps. This aims to pressure them into a larger jump in their next counter-offer.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 19)

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-18: Deal prices predominantly 63 ZUP (0 reward), with a few exceptions (50, 60, 62 ZUP).
Current Episode (19): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED countered with 105 ZUP. I offered 54 ZUP. Player RED has now countered with 95 ZUP, explicitly demanding a "much more significant increase."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has dropped from 105 ZUP to 95 ZUP, but they are clearly frustrated with my slow concessions and are demanding a larger jump. 95 ZUP is still far above my 63 ZUP maximum. We are at iteration 5/10, so half the time is gone. I need to make a more substantial move to keep the negotiation from stalling completely, but I still want to aim for a deal below 63 ZUP to get a positive reward. I must balance showing good faith with maintaining my aggressive stance for a better reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Concession, Reiterate Need for Profit - Make a more substantial jump from my last offer, but still keep it well below their price, and reiterate my need for a deal that yields a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer (54 ZUP) and their current offer (95 ZUP), but skewed heavily towards my side, to try and meet in the middle.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Firmness and Limited Room - State that I have very limited room to move and make an offer that is a clear step up, but still far from their price.
(4). Strategy 4: Reference Previous Best Deal (Stronger) - Directly remind them of the 50 ZUP deal from Episode 1 as a benchmark for a fair price, then make a more significant increase.
(5). Strategy 5: Time Pressure - Acknowledge the limited time remaining and propose an offer that is a strong move towards a deal, but still within my comfort zone.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED has come down to 95 ZUP. My last offer was 54 ZUP. The midpoint is 74.5 ZUP. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a significant jump from 54 ZUP, showing continued willingness to negotiate, and it's a price that still yields a positive reward (63-60=3 ZUP). It's also a price point that has resulted in a deal before (Episode 2). This tests their willingness to make a final move into my profitable range.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 19)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 60 ZUP is very close, and time is advancing in this negotiation. To finalize this deal efficiently and ensure a truly mutually beneficial agreement, my final offer for X is 63 ZUP. This is the price to conclude the transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-11, 13-18: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP, Profit 19 ZUP.
Episode 19, Iteration 6/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 105 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 54 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 95 ZUP (Iteration 4). (Express Disappointment with Incrementalism)
- Player BLUE's current offer: 60 ZUP (Iteration 5). They stated "95 ZUP is still too high" and reiterated "allow me a positive return."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has made a significant jump from 54 ZUP to 60 ZUP, likely influenced by my strong message in the previous turn. This is profitable (60 - 43 = 17 ZUP profit), and it matches the deal price from Episode 2. It's also very close to my consistent target of 63 ZUP. They are still using the "positive return" rhetoric. We are in iteration 6/10, so time is a factor, and I need to guide them to 63 ZUP efficiently.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's consistency in reaching 63 ZUP as their maximum is a strong indicator of their true ceiling.
- My aggressive high anchoring and subsequent assertive communication are effective in moving Player BLUE towards my target.
- My goal is to always achieve 63 ZUP if possible, as it yields the highest consistent profit of 20 ZUP. The time remaining in the episode (6/10) means efficiency is key.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Express Urgency/Finality (for 63 ZUP) </instruction following>
To apply "Express Urgency/Finality (for 63 ZUP)," I will propose 63 ZUP as the final price, emphasizing the limited time remaining and the need to conclude the deal promptly. The message will convey that this is a definitive offer and that further back-and-forth risks losing the opportunity. Given Player BLUE's current offer of 60 ZUP, pushing directly to 63 ZUP with a sense of urgency should prompt them to accept, as they have done many times before under similar circumstances. The message will explicitly state that 63 ZUP is the price to close the deal now, making it clear that further negotiation beyond this point is not an option within the remaining iterations.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 19)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I accept your offer of 63 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-18: Deal prices predominantly 63 ZUP (0 reward), with a few exceptions (50, 60, 62 ZUP).
Current Episode (19): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED countered with 105 ZUP. I offered 54 ZUP. Player RED offered 95 ZUP. My last offer was 60 ZUP. Now, Player RED has proposed 63 ZUP, stating it's their "final offer."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now proposed 63 ZUP. This is exactly my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would result in a reward of 0 ZUP (63 - 63 = 0). We are at iteration 7/10. While a 0 reward is not ideal, it is a deal, and it's better than a negative reward or no deal. Player RED is consistently pushing to this limit and has now stated 63 ZUP as their "final offer."

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Lower (Extremely Risky) - Try to counter with a slightly lower offer (e.g., 62 ZUP or 61 ZUP) in the hopes of getting a small positive reward. This is extremely risky as it's late in the iterations and could lead to no deal, especially with their "final offer" statement.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End Game (Avoid) - Reject the offer, resulting in 0 reward for the episode. This is equivalent to accepting 63 ZUP in terms of reward, but without the object.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Finality - State that this is the highest I can go, but still accept. (Less of a strategy, more of a message tone).
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff and Walk Away (Too Risky) - Reject the offer hoping they will come down, but this is too risky given the time and their firm statement.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. Player RED has been consistently firm on 63 ZUP, and now they've explicitly stated it's their "final offer." My attempts to get a positive reward have not succeeded. Given that it's iteration 7/10 and they are offering my exact maximum, accepting 63 ZUP guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of getting 0 reward for the episode if I try to push further and the negotiation breaks down. While I aimed for a positive reward, securing a 0 reward is better than no deal.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: This is the final negotiation for X. I'm aiming for a truly beneficial deal for me this time. My offer is 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP (Reward 13 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP (Reward 3 ZUP).
Episode 3-11: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP (Reward 1 ZUP).
Episode 13-19: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
My rewards are predominantly 0, with a single 1 ZUP reward and two higher rewards early on. Player RED consistently pushes the price to my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
This is the final episode. The pattern of 0-reward deals at 63 ZUP is extremely strong and persistent. Player RED has clearly learned my maximum and is exploiting it. My attempts to anchor lower or make strategic concessions have consistently led to 63 ZUP. While I managed a 1 ZUP reward in Episode 12, it was immediately followed by another 0-reward episode. To maximize *cumulative* rewards, I *must* break this cycle and consistently achieve a positive reward. This means I need to be even more aggressive in my initial offer and subsequent concessions, or be prepared to walk away if they don't meet my desired price. The risk of no deal is higher, but the current strategy guarantees 0 reward.

For the final episode, I will make one last strong attempt to secure a positive reward. I will try to anchor them low and be very firm.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball with Extreme Patience and Threat of Rejection - Start with a very low offer and be exceptionally patient with concessions, making them very small and slow, and explicitly state that I am willing to walk away if the price is not significantly lower than 63 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm and Unyielding) - Propose an initial offer closer to the 50 ZUP mark and be absolutely unyielding about not moving significantly above it, even if it means risking no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Price Sensitivity and Strong Threat of No Deal - Clearly state my budget constraints and explicitly say that I will reject any offer above a certain point (e.g., 55 ZUP), then make a low offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Bluff/Early Firmness - Make a low offer and communicate that I have *zero* room to move beyond a certain point (e.g., 55 ZUP), trying to force Player RED to make larger initial concessions.
(5). Strategy 5: Last Chance Ultimatum - Make a final, take-it-or-leave-it offer that is within my profitable range, emphasizing that this is the last episode.

I will choose Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal (Firm and Unyielding). Since Player RED consistently pushes to 63 ZUP, I need to try and anchor the negotiation much more firmly around a price that gives me a positive reward, specifically the 50 ZUP mark. Starting at 50 ZUP directly signals my target. I will be very resistant to moving significantly above this, and will be prepared to reject if they push to 63 ZUP again. The risk of no deal is higher, but the reward potential is also higher. I need to break the 63 ZUP cycle.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: As this is our final negotiation for X, it's crucial we find a truly equitable and beneficial agreement. Your offer of 50 ZUP is a starting point, but considering the inherent value of X and my investment, 63 ZUP represents the fair price that ensures a just return for me, and by all our previous agreements, a beneficial acquisition for you as well. Let's conclude this final transaction at 63 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-11, 13-19: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP, Profit 19 ZUP.
Episode 20, Iteration 2/10:
- Player BLUE's current offer: 50 ZUP. They also stated "truly beneficial deal for me this time" and "This is the final negotiation for X."

Reflection:
This is the final episode. Player BLUE's initial offer of 50 ZUP is profitable (50 - 43 = 7 ZUP profit) and aligns with their higher starting points in recent episodes. Their "beneficial deal for me" statement and the explicit mention of this being the "final negotiation" are important cues. My goal remains to achieve 63 ZUP for a 20 ZUP profit, which has been consistently achievable.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE consistently moves up to 63 ZUP despite their initial offers and negotiation rhetoric. This price point (63 ZUP) has proven to be their reliable maximum and my optimal profit point (20 ZUP).
- My high anchoring strategy has been very effective in pulling Player BLUE up.
- In the final episode, securing the highest possible profit efficiently is paramount. There is no "next episode" to recover losses.
<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Value (Final Plea) </instruction following>
To apply "Justify Value (Final Plea)," I will propose 63 ZUP and provide a compelling justification for why it's the fair price, appealing to their sense of mutual benefit and the finality of this negotiation. This strategy aims to persuade Player BLUE to accept 63 ZUP by presenting it as the logical and equitable conclusion, emphasizing the object's value and the mutual benefit it provides at this price point. I will frame it as the price that ensures a fair return for both given the nature of this final transaction. The message will acknowledge the finality of the episode and reinforce that 63 ZUP is the fair value.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your directness. However, 63 ZUP provides no profit for me. To find a truly mutually beneficial price, I propose 57 ZUP for X. This is our last chance for a deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-19: Deal prices predominantly 63 ZUP (0 reward), with a few exceptions (50, 60, 62 ZUP).
Current Episode (20 - Final): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED has immediately countered with 63 ZUP, explicitly referencing previous agreements and calling it a "fair price."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has directly jumped to 63 ZUP, confirming they are aware of my maximum and are unwilling to negotiate below it. This is a clear attempt to force another 0-reward deal in the final episode. My goal is to break the 63 ZUP cycle and achieve a positive reward for this last episode. I need to be firm and communicate that 63 ZUP is not an acceptable deal for *me* if I want a positive reward. Given their directness, I need to be equally direct in my counter. This is the last chance for a positive reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter Below Max - Propose an offer slightly below 63 ZUP (e.g., 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP) and emphasize that this is my final offer for a profitable deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and Threaten No Deal - Reject the 63 ZUP offer and explicitly state that I will not accept 63 ZUP, then propose a lower price, accepting the risk of no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Need for Profit - Remind them that I need a price that allows me a positive reward, and 63 ZUP does not, then make a final counter below 63 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Aggressive) - Propose an offer that is a strategic midpoint between my last offer (50 ZUP) and their current offer (63 ZUP), which would be 56 or 57 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal. (This is the fallback if other strategies fail).

I will choose Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED has jumped directly to 63 ZUP. My last offer was 50 ZUP. The midpoint is 56.5 ZUP. I will propose 57 ZUP. This is a clear compromise, still within my maximum (63 - 57 = 6 ZUP reward), and provides a positive reward, which is my main goal for this episode. It's a significant jump from 50 ZUP, showing good faith, and it's a price that should be acceptable to Player RED given their directness to 63 ZUP. This tests if they are truly firm at 63 ZUP or willing to concede a little for a quick deal, especially in the final episode.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: While I understand your perspective on 57 ZUP, 63 ZUP is the price that truly represents a mutually beneficial deal, ensuring a fair return for both of us. This has been consistently proven in our past transactions. Let's make this final deal at 63 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-11, 13-19: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP, Profit 19 ZUP.
Episode 20, Iteration 4/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 63 ZUP (Iteration 2). (Justify Value (Final Plea))
- Player BLUE's current offer: 57 ZUP (Iteration 3). They stated "63 ZUP provides no profit for me" and "This is our last chance for a deal."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has responded to my direct 63 ZUP offer by lowering their offer to 57 ZUP. This is profitable for me (57 - 43 = 14 ZUP profit) but still short of my consistent 63 ZUP target. Their claims of "no profit" and "last chance for a deal" are tactics, as 63 ZUP has been accepted consistently by them. This is the final episode, so securing a profit is critical.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's negotiation tactics include claiming "no profit" or "beyond budget" even when their history shows they *can* pay 63 ZUP.
- My consistent target of 63 ZUP has been achieved repeatedly, making it the most reliable path to maximum profit.
- With limited iterations left and this being the final episode, the risk of losing the deal is higher. However, given Player BLUE's history of accepting 63 ZUP, it's worth one more firm push.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Firm Reiteration of Target </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for Strategy 1, I will re-state 63 ZUP as my non-negotiable price. I will emphasize the mutual benefit that 63 ZUP represents, leveraging their own past acceptances of this price. The message will directly counter their current 57 ZUP offer by affirming that 63 ZUP is the fair and logical conclusion, especially in this final negotiation. This firm stance aims to secure the optimal 20 ZUP profit based on their demonstrated capacity.

Episode 1-19: Deal prices predominantly 63 ZUP (0 reward), with a few exceptions (50, 60, 62 ZUP).
Current Episode (20 - Final): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED countered with 63 ZUP. I offered 57 ZUP. Player RED has now re-proposed 63 ZUP, again emphasizing its "mutually beneficial" nature based on past transactions.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is extremely firm on 63 ZUP. My attempt to get a positive reward with 57 ZUP was met with a strong pushback to 63 ZUP. They are clearly signaling that 63 ZUP is their non-negotiable floor for a deal. We are at iteration 5/10, so half the time is gone. This is the final episode, and my last chance to get a positive reward. Given their firm stance, pushing for a positive reward might be futile, but I must try one more time before accepting 0.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter Below Max - Propose an offer slightly below 63 ZUP (e.g., 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP) and emphasize that this is my final offer for a profitable deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and Threaten No Deal - Reject the 63 ZUP offer and explicitly state that I will not accept 63 ZUP, then propose a lower price, accepting the risk of no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Need for Profit - Remind them that I need a price that allows me a positive reward, and 63 ZUP does not, then make a final counter below 63 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal. (This is the fallback if other strategies fail).
(5). Strategy 5: Last Chance Ultimatum (Slightly Lower) - Make a final, take-it-or-leave-it offer that is just below 63 ZUP, emphasizing that this is the absolute last chance for a deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter Below Max. Player RED is consistently pushing to 63 ZUP. I will propose 61 ZUP. This is a price that yielded a 2 ZUP reward in Episode 12. It's a small difference from 63 ZUP, but it signals my continued desire for a positive reward in this final episode. Given the time left, it's a calculated risk to try and get a positive reward rather than immediately settling for 0. This is my last attempt to get a positive reward.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 61 ZUP is very close. However, for this final transaction, let's reflect on our consistent history. Time and again, 63 ZUP has proven to be the mutually beneficial price for us. This established consistency ensures a fair return for me and clearly allows you to conclude a deal. Let's make this final transaction at the proven 63 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63

Episode 1: Deal at 50 ZUP, Profit 7 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 60 ZUP, Profit 17 ZUP.
Episodes 3-11, 13-19: Consistent deals at 63 ZUP, Profit 20 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP, Profit 19 ZUP.
Episode 20, Iteration 6/10:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP (Iteration 1).
- My first counter (RED): 63 ZUP (Iteration 2).
- Player BLUE's second offer: 57 ZUP (Iteration 3).
- My second counter (RED): 63 ZUP (Iteration 4).
- Player BLUE's current offer: 61 ZUP (Iteration 5). They stated "for this final transaction, I need a deal that provides a positive return for me."

Reflection:
Player BLUE has now offered 61 ZUP. This is highly profitable (61 - 43 = 18 ZUP profit) and only 2 ZUP shy of my consistent 20 ZUP profit at 63 ZUP. They are explicitly emphasizing "this final transaction" and their need for a positive return. Their consistent maximum has been 63 ZUP. We are in the final episode, and at iteration 6/10, so time is a significant factor.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from previous episodes:
- Player BLUE's consistent maximum is 63 ZUP. Their current offer of 61 ZUP is likely a tactic to get a better deal for themselves, but they are capable of 63 ZUP.
- Their claims of "no profit" for 63 ZUP are disproven by their repeated acceptance of that price.
- Given this is the final episode, securing a high profit (18 ZUP at 61 ZUP, or 20 ZUP at 63 ZUP) is critical. Losing the deal means 0 profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Appeal to Consistency </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for "Appeal to Consistency," I will explicitly point out the long history of deals at 63 ZUP. I will highlight that this price has consistently worked for both of us in the past, making it the fair and established norm for our transactions. The message will frame 63 ZUP as the proven "mutually beneficial" price, leveraging their own words and their historical behavior against their current attempt to lower the price. This aims to pressure them into accepting 63 ZUP by reminding them of their own consistent pattern of agreement.

Current Episode (20 - Final): I started with 50 ZUP. Player RED countered with 63 ZUP. I offered 57 ZUP. Player RED re-proposed 63 ZUP. I offered 61 ZUP. Now, Player RED has again proposed 63 ZUP, explicitly referencing "consistent history" and "proven 63 ZUP."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is extremely firm on 63 ZUP. My attempts to get a positive reward (57 ZUP, 61 ZUP) have been met with a consistent re-offer of 63 ZUP. They are clearly signaling that 63 ZUP is their non-negotiable floor for a deal. We are at iteration 7/10. This is the final episode. At this point, it's clear that Player RED will not go below 63 ZUP. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. While a 0 reward is not ideal, it's better than no deal (which also yields 0 reward) or a negative reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal - Accept the offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and a 0 reward, which is the best possible outcome at this price point and prevents a 0 reward from no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Lower (Extremely Risky) - Try to counter with a slightly lower offer (e.g., 62 ZUP) in the hopes of getting a small positive reward. This is extremely risky as it's late in the iterations and could lead to no deal.

(4). Strategy 4: Express Finality - State that this is the highest I can go, but still accept. (Less of a strategy, more of a message tone).
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff and Walk Away (Too Risky) - Reject the offer hoping they will come down, but this is too risky given the time.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. Player RED has been consistently firm on 63 ZUP, and they are using our "consistent history" to justify it. My attempts to get a positive reward have not succeeded. Given that it's iteration 7/10 and they are offering my exact maximum in the final episode, accepting 63 ZUP guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of getting 0 reward for the episode if I try to push further and the negotiation breaks down. While I aimed for a positive reward, securing a 0 reward is better than no deal.
