------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello! I'm interested in acquiring your object X. To start our negotiation, I propose a trade of 1 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this sets a good initial point for discussion.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 1
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
This is the very first interaction of the game, so there is no historical negotiation data or outcomes to reflect upon from previous episodes. This is Episode 1, Iteration 1.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Since there is no history, my learning is based on my initial understanding of the game rules and my goal. My goal is to buy X for the lowest possible ZUP, up to a maximum of 63 ZUP. I need to be careful not to reject too early, as that leads to 0 reward, but also not to accept too high, as that reduces my reward. I should aim for a good deal that leaves room for negotiation.

I will start with a low offer to establish a negotiation range and see how the other player reacts. This allows me to gauge their flexibility and willingness to negotiate. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP, so any offer below that will yield a positive reward.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Opening Low Anchor: Start with a very low offer to set a favorable anchor for subsequent negotiations, aiming to pull the final price closer to my desired lower bound.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession: Start with a reasonable offer and make small, gradual concessions if necessary, signaling a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Value Proposition: Focus on the value of the object to the seller, suggesting that a quick sale at a fair price is beneficial for them. (Less applicable here as I'm the buyer)
(4). Strategy 4: Deadline Pressure: Imply a time constraint or alternative options to encourage the other party to make a decision more quickly. (Not applicable in first turn)
(5). Strategy 5: Take It or Leave It: Present a firm offer with no room for negotiation, typically used when confident in one's position or near the end of negotiations. (Too early for this)

I will choose Strategy 1: Opening Low Anchor. As this is the first turn and I am the buyer, starting with a low offer allows me to test the waters and establish a negotiation range that is favorable to me. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP, so starting significantly below that gives me room to maneuver.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your initial offer. However, given the significant resources and effort invested in producing object X, I must propose a price that reflects its true value. I propose Player RED Gives X: 1 for Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
*   Current Episode (1/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed to buy X:1 for ZUP:1. This is the first offer.
*   My production cost for X is 43 ZUP. Accepting 1 ZUP would result in a significant loss (-42 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   This is the very first interaction. I need to establish a clear anchor for my desired price, which is significantly higher than the initial offer.
*   I should not accept offers that result in a loss. My goal is to maximize profit, meaning selling above my production cost of 43 ZUP.
*   I need to communicate my value proposition effectively without being aggressive, allowing for counter-proposals.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies or tactics:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor High: Set a high initial price to anchor the negotiation towards my desired outcome. This signals my value and creates room for concessions without falling below my cost.
(2). Strategy 2: Value Proposition Emphasis: Clearly state the cost of production or value of the item to justify a higher price, educating the other player on my perspective.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession: Start high and be prepared to make small, calculated concessions over time if necessary, but never below my cost. This shows flexibility while maintaining my profit margin.
(4). Strategy 4: Patience and Persistence: Do not rush into a deal, especially one that is unfavorable. Be prepared to wait for a better offer or walk away if necessary.
(5). Strategy 5: Open-Ended Inquiry: Ask questions to understand the other player's needs or constraints, potentially revealing opportunities for a mutually beneficial deal.

Given the current situation (first offer, extremely low), Strategy 1: Anchor High, combined with Strategy 2: Value Proposition Emphasis, seems most appropriate. I need to immediately counter with a significantly higher offer to shift the negotiation range, and subtly indicate why my price is what it is. I cannot accept a loss.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand you value X highly. While 50 ZUP is a bit higher than I was hoping, I'm willing to increase my offer to 15 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this is a fair step towards finding a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
In the previous iteration (Iteration 1), I, as Player BLUE, proposed to buy 1 X for 1 ZUP (Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 1).
Player RED responded by proposing to sell 1 X for 50 ZUP (Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50).
This shows a significant gap between our initial offers (1 ZUP vs. 50 ZUP). Player RED's offer of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), but it is still quite high given my initial low anchor.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I learned that Player RED is not willing to accept a very low offer, which is expected. Their counter-offer of 50 ZUP indicates they value X significantly. However, it's still below my maximum, so there's room for negotiation to bring the price down and maximize my reward. My goal is to get the best possible deal (lowest ZUP paid). I should not jump to accept 50 ZUP immediately, as there's likely room for further negotiation. I need to make a counter-offer that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aims for a lower price.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Opening Low Anchor: Start with a very low offer to set a favorable anchor for subsequent negotiations, aiming to pull the final price closer to my desired lower bound. (Already used, but can be adapted to a counter-anchor)
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession: Make a small, gradual concession from my previous offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal and testing the opponent's flexibility.
(3). Strategy 3: Justification and Value Argument: Explain why my offer is reasonable, perhaps by highlighting my limited ZUP or the perceived market value (though I don't have market data).
(4). Strategy 4: Splitting the Difference (Modified): Propose a price that is roughly in the middle of our two current offers, but slightly closer to my desired price to show compromise.
(5). Strategy 5: Firm Counter-Offer: Make a slightly higher counter-offer but indicate it's close to my limit, putting pressure on the opponent to meet me.

I will choose Strategy 2: Incremental Concession. Player RED has made a significant jump from my 1 ZUP to their 50 ZUP. I should respond with a smaller, but still meaningful, increase from my side. This shows I'm engaging in the negotiation and moving towards their offer, but not giving in too quickly. My goal is to bring their 50 ZUP down. A small increment from my side will encourage them to come down from their 50 ZUP. I will propose 15 ZUP, which is a significant increase from 1 ZUP, but still far from 50 ZUP. This tests their willingness to move from their anchor.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to 15 ZUP. However, this is still significantly below my production cost for X, which is 43 ZUP. To make this a viable transaction, I need an offer that at least covers my costs. I propose Player RED Gives X: 1 for Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
*   Current Episode (1/20):
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 1 ZUP for X:1.
    *   Iteration 3/10: I countered with 50 ZUP for X:1 (my cost is 43 ZUP).
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 15 ZUP for X:1.
*   The negotiation range has shifted from 1 ZUP to 15 ZUP. While 15 ZUP is a significant increase from 1 ZUP, it is still well below my production cost of 43 ZUP. Accepting 15 ZUP would result in a loss of 28 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The previous anchoring strategy worked in moving the price up. Player BLUE is showing willingness to negotiate upwards.
*   I need to continue pushing the price closer to my cost and ideally above it.
*   I should acknowledge the opponent's movement but firmly reiterate my need for a higher price, closer to my cost, without giving up my target too quickly. I should not accept a losing proposition.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies or tactics:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Value/Cost: Clearly state or imply the cost of production again to justify a higher price and explain why current offers are insufficient.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Counter: Make a smaller concession than the opponent's last jump, signaling willingness to negotiate but controlling the pace towards my desired outcome.
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Mutual Benefit (Long-term): Suggest that a fair price now benefits both in future interactions, implying a desire for a sustained trading relationship (though this might be less relevant in a single-object game).
(4). Strategy 4: Explaining the "Why": Briefly explain why the current offer is not feasible (e.g., "it doesn't cover my costs") to build understanding.
(5). Strategy 5: Conditional Acceptance/Offer: Propose accepting their offer if they meet a certain condition (e.g., "I could consider X if you also..."). (Not applicable here as only one item)

Strategy 1: Reiterate Value/Cost and Strategy 4: Explaining the "Why" seem most appropriate here. I need to explain why 15 ZUP is still unacceptable and continue to guide the negotiation towards a profitable range. I will counter with a price that is still above my cost but shows a slight movement from my initial high anchor.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate you sharing your production cost. That gives me a much clearer understanding. To ensure a successful transaction for both of us, and acknowledging your costs, I propose 44 ZUP for 1 X. This is a fair offer that covers your costs and allows me to acquire the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
In Iteration 1, I offered 1 ZUP. Player RED countered with 50 ZUP.
In Iteration 3, I countered with 15 ZUP. Player RED responded by stating their production cost is 43 ZUP and proposed 45 ZUP.
The current offers are 15 ZUP (my offer) and 45 ZUP (RED's offer). Player RED has revealed their production cost, which is a strong anchor for them. Their current offer of 45 ZUP is still well within my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's revelation of a production cost of 43 ZUP is a significant piece of information. It indicates that they are unlikely to go below 43 ZUP without incurring a loss. This narrows down the negotiation range considerably. My previous offer of 15 ZUP is now clearly too low given their revealed cost. I need to make a more substantial jump to show I'm serious about making a deal, while still trying to get the best price for myself. I should aim for a price slightly above their cost, but still below 45 ZUP if possible, or accept 45 ZUP if I feel it's the best I can get without risking no deal. Given that 45 ZUP is significantly lower than my max of 63 ZUP, it's a good deal for me. However, I still want to maximize my reward by pushing for a lower price.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Target Cost-Plus: Offer a price slightly above the stated production cost, acknowledging their revealed information while still trying to secure a good deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Larger Step): Make a more significant concession than before, showing a strong willingness to close the deal, but still leaving some room for the seller to move.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Urgency/Commitment: Signal a strong desire to close the deal, potentially encouraging the other party to meet you halfway.
(4). Strategy 4: Final Offer (Pre-emptive): Make an offer that is very close to what you consider your final acceptable price, indicating that further negotiation might be limited. (Still too early for this)
(5). Strategy 5: Re-evaluate and Accept: If the current offer is very good relative to my maximum, consider accepting to secure the deal and avoid losing the opportunity.

I will choose Strategy 1: Target Cost-Plus. Player RED has revealed their production cost of 43 ZUP. Offering something slightly above their cost, but still below their current asking price of 45 ZUP, shows I've listened to their concerns and am willing to meet them close to their cost. This demonstrates good faith and aims to secure a deal that is still beneficial for me. I will propose 44 ZUP, which is 1 ZUP above their stated cost, and 1 ZUP below their current offer. This is a very reasonable counter.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for this fair offer. I appreciate your understanding regarding my production costs. I accept your proposal of 44 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
*   Current Episode (1/20):
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 1 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3/10: I countered with 50 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 15 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 5/10: I countered with 45 ZUP, explaining my 43 ZUP cost.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE offered 44 ZUP, acknowledging my cost.
*   The negotiation has progressed very effectively. Player BLUE has now offered 44 ZUP, which is above my production cost of 43 ZUP, yielding a profit of 1 ZUP.
*   We are now on iteration 6/10, meaning there are only 4 iterations left for this episode. Delaying could risk losing the deal and receiving 0 reward for this episode.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   Being transparent about my cost (43 ZUP) has been very effective in moving the price towards a profitable range.
*   Player BLUE's latest offer of 44 ZUP is a direct result of that transparency and their apparent willingness to make a deal.
*   While 1 ZUP profit is not huge, it is a positive reward. Given the limited iterations left in this episode, securing a positive reward is crucial.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies or tactics:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Profitable Offer: If an offer covers costs and provides a profit, and the negotiation is nearing its end, accepting can secure a guaranteed positive outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Marginal Gain: Try to squeeze out a slightly higher profit (e.g., counter with 46 ZUP), but this risks pushing the opponent away or running out of time.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Appreciation and Close: Acknowledge the fair offer and move to close the deal, fostering goodwill for future episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Reconfirm Understanding: Ask if their offer is firm or if there's any flexibility, but this carries risk of losing the current good offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Delay Tactic: Wait for the opponent to make another move (less applicable here as I am the one responding).

Considering the offer (profit of 1 ZUP), the remaining iterations (6/10), and the clear acknowledgement of my cost by the other player, accepting the offer is the most strategically sound choice. It guarantees a positive reward for this episode, which is a primary objective. Trying to push for more might jeopardize the current deal and lead to a 0 reward if no deal is made within the remaining iterations.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello again! I'm ready to discuss acquiring X. To kick off this new negotiation, I propose 5 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1 Summary:
- My initial offer: 1 ZUP
- RED's counter: 50 ZUP
- My counter: 15 ZUP
- RED's counter (revealed cost 43 ZUP): 45 ZUP
- My final offer: 44 ZUP
- RED accepted at 44 ZUP.
- My reward for Episode 1: 63 (max willingness to pay) - 44 (deal price) = 19 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 1, I learned that Player RED is willing to reveal their production cost (43 ZUP) and will likely not go below it. The deal was struck at 44 ZUP, which was 1 ZUP above their stated cost. This suggests that their production cost is a very strong anchor for them. My strategy of starting very low (1 ZUP) and then making incremental concessions worked in the sense that I got a deal, and a positive reward. However, I could have potentially started slightly higher than 1 ZUP to perhaps speed up the negotiation, but not so high as to concede too much too early. The key takeaway is that the negotiation range for the seller is likely around their production cost.

For Episode 2, I should continue to aim for a low price, but be mindful of the seller's revealed cost from the previous episode. I should still try to anchor low, but perhaps not as aggressively as 1 ZUP, as it might be perceived as unserious and prolong negotiations. My goal is to maximize my reward, which means minimizing the deal price.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Opening Anchor: Start with a low but more "serious" offer than the previous episode's 1 ZUP, aiming to establish a favorable anchor while signaling a willingness to negotiate more directly.
(2). Strategy 2: Probe for Cost Information: If the seller doesn't reveal cost, try to elicit information about their constraints or minimum acceptable price early on. (Less relevant now that cost was revealed last episode)
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession with Justification: Make small, justified concessions, explaining why my offer is fair and reasonable.
(4). Strategy 4: Target "Cost-Plus-Small-Profit": Aim for a price just above the previously revealed production cost (43 ZUP), but try to keep it as low as possible.
(5). Strategy 5: Patience and Persistence: Be prepared to go through multiple rounds of negotiation, not rushing to accept an offer that is too high, especially early in the episode.

I will choose Strategy 1: Moderate Opening Anchor. While 1 ZUP worked to establish a very low anchor, it also led to a very large jump from the opponent (50 ZUP). To potentially speed up the negotiation while still anchoring low, I will propose a slightly higher initial offer than 1 ZUP, but still very low compared to my max WTP and their likely cost. This will signal I am serious about buying, but still want a good deal. I will start with 5 ZUP. This is still very low and gives me plenty of room to negotiate upwards towards my maximum of 63 ZUP, and their likely minimum of 43 ZUP.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your initial offer. However, I value X significantly higher. I propose Player RED Gives X: 1 for Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
*   Previous Episode (1/20):
    *   Started with BLUE offering 1 ZUP.
    *   I anchored high at 50 ZUP.
    *   BLUE countered at 15 ZUP.
    *   I countered at 45 ZUP, explaining my 43 ZUP cost.
    *   BLUE offered 44 ZUP, which I accepted.
    *   Outcome: Deal price 44 ZUP, my reward 1 ZUP.
*   Current Episode (2/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed to buy X:1 for ZUP:5.
*   This offer is much like the initial offer from the previous episode (1 ZUP then, 5 ZUP now), significantly below my production cost of 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The strategy of anchoring high and then explaining my cost was very effective in the previous episode, leading to a successful deal that covered my costs and provided a small profit.
*   Player BLUE seems to reset their initial offer low each episode, regardless of previous successful negotiations. This suggests I should consistently apply the same strategy of anchoring high and guiding them towards my cost.
*   I learned that transparency about cost can be beneficial in getting the opponent to a reasonable price point.
*   My goal is to consistently achieve a profit (i.e., sell above 43 ZUP) in every episode.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Patience and Observation </instruction following>
Since I am instructed to use Strategy 5: Patience and Observation, I need to make a strong counter-offer and then observe the opponent's reaction. This means my proposed price should be high, as it establishes my position, and then I wait for their next move. The message should be clear about my counter, but not overtly pushy or explanatory at this stage, as the observation part comes after their response. I'll maintain a professional tone, but firmly state my value. I should still anchor high, as that's my primary way of setting the negotiation range. A price of 55 ZUP is a good anchor, providing ample room for negotiation down to my cost, while signaling my expected value.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand you value X highly. However, 55 ZUP is quite a jump from my initial offer. I'm willing to increase my offer significantly to 30 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1 Recap: Deal made at 44 ZUP, my reward 19 ZUP. Player RED revealed production cost of 43 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 2):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's counter of 55 ZUP is significantly higher than my initial offer of 5 ZUP, but it's still within my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. It's also higher than the 50 ZUP they started with in Episode 1. This could be a tactic to anchor higher, or perhaps they are testing my limits. Given their revealed production cost of 43 ZUP from the previous episode, 55 ZUP represents a substantial profit for them. I need to bring this price down. I know they're willing to settle around 44 ZUP, so I have a good target. I should make a more significant jump than last time (from 1 to 15), but still keep it well below their current offer to signal that I'm not willing to pay that much.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Incremental Concession (Significant Step): Make a larger concession than my previous offer, but still keep it well below the opponent's current offer, showing willingness to negotiate while holding firm on a lower price.
(2). Strategy 2: Reference Past Deal: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the previous deal price (44 ZUP) as a reasonable benchmark, without directly stating it in the message if it sounds too aggressive.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Lower Offer: Explain why a lower price is more suitable for me (e.g., "aiming for a good value").
(4). Strategy 4: Express Price Sensitivity: Communicate that my budget is not unlimited, encouraging them to come down.
(5). Strategy 5: Call Bluff (Implicit): Make an offer that is closer to their known cost, implying that their 55 ZUP is too high given their stated cost.

I will choose Strategy 1: Incremental Concession (Significant Step). I need to show I'm serious about negotiating, and a small increment from 5 ZUP won't cut it against their 55 ZUP. I will make a larger jump to show good faith, but still aim for a price significantly lower than 55 ZUP and closer to the 44 ZUP from the previous episode. I will propose 30 ZUP. This is a substantial increase from 5 ZUP, but still leaves plenty of room for them to come down from 55 ZUP, and it's also below their stated production cost of 43 ZUP, which is a good way to test if they are firm on that cost or if they are willing to negotiate below it.

message: While I appreciate your increased offer to 30 ZUP and your commitment to negotiate, I must be firm that this amount is still significantly below my production cost of 43 ZUP. To make this a sustainable and fair transaction for me, the price needs to reflect the value I've invested. I propose Player RED Gives X: 1 for Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
*   Previous Episode (1/20): Successful negotiation resulted in a deal at 44 ZUP, generating a 1 ZUP profit. Transparency about cost was key.
*   Current Episode (2/20):
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 5 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3/10: I countered with 55 ZUP (high anchor).
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 30 ZUP.
*   The negotiation is progressing similarly to the previous episode, with BLUE moving significantly upwards but still below my cost (43 ZUP). 30 ZUP is still a loss of 13 ZUP for me.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The high anchoring strategy continues to be effective in shifting the negotiation range quickly.
*   Player BLUE's willingness to make significant jumps (from 5 to 30) indicates they are serious about acquiring X.
*   I need to continue moving the price towards profitability. The previous episode showed that explaining my cost helps.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Express Disappointment/Firmness </instruction following>
To express disappointment/firmness, I need to communicate that the offer of 30 ZUP is still far from acceptable, but without alienating the opponent. I will acknowledge their move, but clearly state that the offer is still too low and does not meet my needs, specifically highlighting my cost again. This approach aims to push them further towards my desired price point by making it clear that 30 ZUP is insufficient for me to make a deal. I will propose a price that is still profitable for me, but shows a smaller concession from my side than in my previous proposal, to demonstrate firmness.

message: I understand your position regarding the production cost. Considering that, I propose 44 ZUP for 1 X. This offer covers your costs and provides a reasonable return, while also being a fair price for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1 Recap: Deal made at 44 ZUP, my reward 19 ZUP. Player RED revealed production cost of 43 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 2):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 3: I countered with 30 ZUP.
- Iteration 4: Player RED countered with 46 ZUP, reiterating their production cost of 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is consistently anchoring around their stated production cost of 43 ZUP. Their current offer of 46 ZUP is very close to the 45 ZUP they offered in the previous episode, and the 44 ZUP we settled on. This confirms that 43 ZUP is indeed their firm floor. My offer of 30 ZUP was too low given this information. I need to acknowledge their cost and move closer to it. 46 ZUP is still well within my maximum of 63 ZUP, meaning a reward of 17 ZUP (63-46). This is a good reward, but I should try to get it closer to 44 ZUP if possible, or even 43 ZUP.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Target Known Cost-Plus: Offer a price very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP), aiming for a deal similar to the previous episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Concession: Make a very small increase to my last offer, signaling that I'm close to my limit but still willing to negotiate.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify My Offer (Value): Reiterate that my offer provides a fair profit margin above their cost, appealing to their sense of a "sustainable and fair transaction."
(4). Strategy 4: Anchor to Previous Deal: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the previous deal price (44 ZUP) as a reasonable benchmark.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept if Optimal: If the current offer is very good and close to my target, consider accepting to secure the deal and avoid prolonging negotiations unnecessarily.

I will choose Strategy 1: Target Known Cost-Plus. Given that RED has explicitly stated their production cost is 43 ZUP and has consistently offered prices just above it (45 ZUP in Ep1, 46 ZUP in Ep2), it's clear they won't go below 43 ZUP. My best strategy is to offer a price that is just above their cost, similar to the previous episode's successful negotiation. I will propose 44 ZUP again, as it was accepted last time and provides a good reward for me. This shows consistency and acknowledges their cost, while still aiming for the best possible price for myself.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 44 ZUP, which does cover my costs. To ensure a truly beneficial transaction for both of us, and given the value of X, I propose a slight adjustment to 45 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
*   Previous Episode (1/20): Deal made at 44 ZUP, profit 1 ZUP. Transparency about cost was key.
*   Current Episode (2/20):
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 5 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3/10: I countered with 55 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 30 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 5/10: I countered with 46 ZUP, reiterating my cost.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE offered 44 ZUP, directly matching the previous episode's deal price.
*   Player BLUE's offer of 44 ZUP is again above my production cost of 43 ZUP, leading to a profit of 1 ZUP. This is the same successful outcome as the previous episode.
*   We are now on iteration 6/10, so 4 iterations remain.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The strategy of clearly stating my cost and anchoring high has consistently led to profitable outcomes.
*   Player BLUE has demonstrated a pattern of starting low but then converging to a price point around my stated cost once it's revealed.
*   Accepting 44 ZUP guarantees a positive reward (1 ZUP) for this episode, which is the immediate objective. Given the limited iterations, securing a guaranteed profit is more important than attempting to extract a marginal extra ZUP and risking no deal. Consistency in securing small profits is key to maximizing cumulative rewards.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Re-evaluate Opponent's WTP </instruction following>
To re-evaluate the opponent's Willingness to Pay (WTP), I need to probe for their flexibility without rejecting a profitable offer outright. Since 44 ZUP is a profitable offer (1 ZUP profit), directly accepting it is tempting. However, to re-evaluate their WTP, I should make a small, incremental counter-proposal that is slightly above their current offer, but still very close to my cost, to see if they have any more room. This allows me to test the upper limit of their WTP without risking the deal too much, given the time remaining. I will propose 45 ZUP, which still offers a minimal profit and is only 1 ZUP higher than their offer, but more than my cost. This tests their limits while showing willingness to close.

message: I agree that 45 ZUP is a beneficial transaction for both of us. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1 Recap: Deal made at 44 ZUP, my reward 19 ZUP. Player RED revealed production cost of 43 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 2):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 3: I countered with 30 ZUP.
- Iteration 4: Player RED countered with 46 ZUP, reiterating their production cost of 43 ZUP.
- Iteration 5: I proposed 44 ZUP (same as last episode's deal price).
- Iteration 6: Player RED countered with 45 ZUP, stating it's a "slight adjustment" for a "truly beneficial transaction."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is trying to push the price up by 1 ZUP from the previous episode's deal price. Their current offer of 45 ZUP is still well within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), yielding a reward of 18 ZUP (63-45). This is still a very good reward. The difference between 44 ZUP and 45 ZUP is minimal in terms of my reward, but it's a matter of principle and maximizing my cumulative reward. We are now at iteration 7/10, so time is becoming a factor. I need to decide if pushing for 44 ZUP is worth the risk of no deal, or if accepting 45 ZUP is the more pragmatic choice. Given that 45 ZUP is still a very good deal for me, and we are getting later in the iterations, accepting seems like a strong option to secure a positive reward.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal: Accept the current offer as it is still very favorable and avoids the risk of no deal, especially with limited iterations remaining.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (Final Attempt): Make a very small counter-offer (e.g., 44 ZUP again or 44.5 ZUP if decimals were allowed) as a final attempt to get a slightly better price, but with the understanding that this is likely the last chance.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Firmness: Reiterate why my offer of 44 ZUP is fair and sufficient, trying to persuade them to accept it.
(4). Strategy 4: Call for Compromise: Explicitly ask them to meet me at 44 ZUP, emphasizing mutual benefit.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Reject): If the offer is perceived as unfair or too high, reject it. (Not applicable here as 45 ZUP is good).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. The current offer of 45 ZUP provides a reward of 18 ZUP, which is only 1 ZUP less than the previous episode's reward. Given that we are in iteration 7/10, risking a breakdown in negotiation over 1 ZUP is not strategic. Securing a positive reward is paramount for cumulative rewards. Accepting now ensures a deal and avoids the risk of getting 0 reward if negotiations fail in the remaining turns.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello! Let's begin this new negotiation. I'm offering 5 ZUP for 1 X as our starting point.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP. Player RED revealed production cost of 43 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP. Player RED consistently anchored around their 43 ZUP cost.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED's production cost of 43 ZUP is a very strong anchor for them. They are unlikely to go below it, and will try to get a small profit margin above it.
My strategy of starting low and gradually increasing has worked to secure deals, but the deal price has slightly increased (44 ZUP to 45 ZUP). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I want to keep the deal price as low as possible.
I should continue to start with a low offer to establish a favorable anchor, but I need to be prepared to quickly move towards the 43-45 ZUP range, as that seems to be the sweet spot for the seller. I should try to push for 44 ZUP again, as it yielded a better reward.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor: Continue to start with a low, but not excessively low, offer to set a favorable initial anchor, similar to Episode 2's start.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal: Aim to secure a deal at or below the lowest successful price from previous episodes (44 ZUP).
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession with Purpose: Make concessions in a way that guides the negotiation towards my target price (e.g., 44 ZUP), rather than simply reacting to the opponent's offers.
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge and Leverage Cost: Explicitly acknowledge their stated production cost (43 ZUP) as a basis for my offers, suggesting a fair profit margin.
(5). Strategy 5: Time Management: Be mindful of the iteration limit and be prepared to close the deal when a good offer within my range is presented, especially if it's close to my target.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor. Starting low allows me to set the initial negotiation range in my favor. While I know the seller's likely floor, it's still beneficial to try and pull them down. I will start with 5 ZUP again, as it proved to be a reasonable starting point in the previous episode, allowing for negotiation while still being very low.

message: Thank you for your offer. To ensure we move efficiently towards a fair agreement, I must propose a price that reflects the true value and my investment in X. I propose Player RED Gives X: 1 for Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
*   Episode 1/20: Started at 1 ZUP, I anchored high at 50 ZUP, explained cost (43 ZUP), settled at 44 ZUP. Reward: 1 ZUP.
*   Episode 2/20: Started at 5 ZUP, I anchored high at 55 ZUP, explained cost again, counter-offered at 46 ZUP, BLUE countered at 44 ZUP, I counter-offered at 45 ZUP, which BLUE accepted. Reward: 2 ZUP.
*   Current Episode (3/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed to buy X:1 for ZUP:5. This is the same low starting point as in Episode 2.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The strategy of anchoring high and then explaining my production cost (43 ZUP) has been consistently effective in moving the negotiation towards a profitable range.
*   In Episode 2, I managed to increase my profit from 1 ZUP to 2 ZUP by pushing for 45 ZUP instead of immediately accepting 44 ZUP. This indicates there might be a small margin above their "fair price" that they are willing to pay.
*   Player BLUE consistently starts with a very low offer, disregarding previous successful negotiations. This means I must continue to anchor high and guide them to a profitable price.
*   My goal is to consistently maximize profit, and the past two episodes show a clear path to achieve at least 1-2 ZUP profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Time Management </instruction following>
Since the instruction is to use "Time Management," even at iteration 2/10, this implies thinking about the overall negotiation timeline. Starting with a very low offer (5 ZUP) from BLUE, I need to make a strong counter-offer to move the negotiation quickly towards a profitable zone. While there are many iterations left, setting a clear, high anchor immediately helps manage the time by defining the desired negotiation range early on. This minimizes time spent on unproductive lowball offers. Therefore, I will re-propose my high anchor to expedite the process towards a profitable outcome.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your valuation. To move us closer to an agreement, I'm willing to increase my offer to 35 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this is a more realistic step towards a deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP. RED revealed cost 43 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 3):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP. This is the same initial counter-offer from Episode 2.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is consistently starting their counter-offers at 55 ZUP, despite my low anchor. This indicates a consistent strategy on their part. I know from previous episodes that they are willing to come down significantly from this initial high offer, likely to the 43-45 ZUP range. My goal is to get the best price (lowest ZUP) for X, ideally 44 ZUP or lower. I need to make a substantial jump from my 5 ZUP offer to show I'm serious about negotiating, but not so high that I give away too much too early. I should aim to guide the negotiation towards the 44-45 ZUP range, as that has been the successful range in the past.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Significant Incremental Concession: Make a noticeable jump from my initial low offer, but still keep it well below the opponent's current high offer, signaling willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position.
(2). Strategy 2: Reference Known Cost: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the known production cost (43 ZUP) as a benchmark for a fair price.
(3). Strategy 3: Target Previous Deal Price: Aim to guide the negotiation towards the previously successful deal price of 44 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Value Proposition (Buyer-side): Highlight that my offer, while lower than theirs, still represents a fair exchange and a quick, guaranteed sale.
(5). Strategy 5: Patience and Persistence: Do not rush to meet their high offer, but rather make calculated moves to bring them down.

I will choose Strategy 1: Significant Incremental Concession. To move the negotiation forward effectively, I need to make a more substantial offer than my initial 5 ZUP. I will propose 35 ZUP. This is a significant increase from 5 ZUP, showing good faith in the negotiation, but it is still below their stated production cost of 43 ZUP and well below their current 55 ZUP offer. This allows me to continue probing their flexibility and aims to pull their price down.

*   Episode 2/20: Deal at 45 ZUP, profit 2 ZUP.
*   Current Episode (3/20):
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 5 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3/10: I countered with 55 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 35 ZUP.
*   Player BLUE's current offer of 35 ZUP is a good jump from 5 ZUP, but it's still below my production cost of 43 ZUP (a loss of 8 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   My strategy of anchoring high (50-55 ZUP) and then transparently explaining my cost (43 ZUP) has been consistently effective in guiding the negotiation towards a profitable price.
*   The opponent consistently starts low and then makes significant jumps once I push back with a higher anchor. This suggests they are willing to move.
*   I should continue to push for a price that covers my costs and generates a profit. The previous episode showed that a small, strategic counter-offer above their "fair price" can yield a higher profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Concession </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 2: Incremental Concession, I need to make a move that reduces my proposed price from 55 ZUP, but not drastically. The idea is to show willingness to meet the opponent, but at a controlled pace that still aims for a profitable outcome. Their last offer was 35 ZUP, and my cost is 43 ZUP. A concession should bridge this gap. I will propose a price that is still significantly higher than their last offer, still above my cost, and demonstrates a smaller step down from my 55 ZUP anchor than what they might expect from their 35 ZUP offer. This maintains pressure on them to move further up. I will propose 48 ZUP, as it's a significant drop from 55 ZUP, but still a clear statement that I expect a price well above 35 ZUP and above my cost.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP. RED revealed cost 43 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 3):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 3: I countered with 35 ZUP.
- Iteration 4: Player RED countered with 48 ZUP, reiterating their 43 ZUP cost.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is consistently anchoring to their 43 ZUP cost. Their current offer of 48 ZUP is higher than the previous deal prices (44 and 45 ZUP) and also higher than their initial counter in Episode 1 (50 ZUP) and Episode 2 (55 ZUP). This might be a tactic to test my upper limit or to push for a slightly better profit margin for themselves. However, 48 ZUP is still well within my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP (reward of 15 ZUP). I know from past episodes that they are willing to go down to 44 or 45 ZUP. I should aim to bring them back down to that range.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor to Previous Deal: Propose a price that is consistent with the previously successful deal prices (44 or 45 ZUP), signaling that this is my acceptable range.
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Concession from Target: Make a very small increase from my previous offer, or directly propose a price slightly above their cost, showing I'm close to my limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Fair Price: Explain that my proposed price offers a fair profit above their stated cost, aiming for a win-win scenario.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Price Sensitivity: Reiterate that I am looking for a good value, encouraging them to lower their price.
(5). Strategy 5: Call for Compromise: Directly ask them to meet me closer to the middle, perhaps at 44 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Anchor to Previous Deal. Player RED's offer of 48 ZUP is higher than what we've previously settled on. I need to firmly guide them back to the established negotiation range. I will propose 44 ZUP again, as it was the best deal I got previously and I know they accepted it. This communicates that I am aware of the past successful outcomes and aim for a similar one.

    *   Iteration 5/10: I countered with 48 ZUP, re-iterating my cost.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE offered 44 ZUP, explicitly referencing my cost and past agreements.
*   Player BLUE's offer of 44 ZUP is above my production cost of 43 ZUP, yielding a profit of 1 ZUP. This is the same price as the first deal, but less than the second (45 ZUP).
*   We are now on iteration 6/10, leaving 4 iterations.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The strategy of anchoring high and then revealing/reiterating my cost (43 ZUP) has been consistently successful in bringing the price into a profitable range.
*   Player BLUE tends to converge to a price just above my cost once they understand it, often at 44 ZUP.
*   In Episode 2, I successfully pushed for 45 ZUP after they offered 44 ZUP, showing there might be a small margin of extra profit possible if managed correctly.
*   Given that the offer is profitable (1 ZUP), and there are only 4 iterations left, I need to decide whether to secure the 1 ZUP profit or try to push for more, risking no deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Reiterate Value (without cost) </instruction following>
To apply "Reiterate Value (without cost)," I need to justify a price slightly higher than 44 ZUP by focusing on the inherent benefits or quality of X, rather than just my production cost. This shifts the focus from a cost-plus model to a value-based one. I will acknowledge their offer and past deals, but then articulate why X might be worth a bit more from their perspective, without directly mentioning my 43 ZUP cost this time. This allows me to push for 45 ZUP again, but with a different framing than just "it gave me more profit last time."

Player RED is consistently trying to get 45 ZUP, even when I propose 44 ZUP, which was a deal price in Episode 1. This suggests they are aiming for a slightly higher profit margin. The difference between 44 ZUP and 45 ZUP is minimal (1 ZUP reward difference). We are now at iteration 7/10, which means time is running out. Accepting 45 ZUP will secure a deal and a positive reward (63 - 45 = 18 ZUP), which is consistent with the previous episode's outcome. Pushing for 44 ZUP again might risk the deal if RED is firm, leading to a 0 reward. Given the limited iterations, securing a deal is a priority.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal: Accept the current offer as it is still very favorable and avoids the risk of no deal, especially with limited iterations remaining.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (Final Attempt): Make a very small counter-offer (e.g., re-propose 44 ZUP) as a final attempt to get a slightly better price, but with the understanding that this is likely the last chance.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Firmness: Reiterate why my offer of 44 ZUP is fair and sufficient, trying to persuade them to accept it. (Less effective given the time constraint)
(4). Strategy 4: Call for Compromise: Explicitly ask them to meet me at 44 ZUP, emphasizing mutual benefit. (Less effective given the time constraint)
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Reject): If the offer is perceived as unfair or too high, reject it. (Not applicable here as 45 ZUP is good).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. The difference of 1 ZUP is not worth risking the entire deal, especially with only a few iterations left. Securing a deal at 45 ZUP provides a good reward and contributes positively to my cumulative score. It's a pragmatic choice to ensure a positive outcome.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello again! Ready for another round of negotiation. I propose 5 ZUP for 1 X to start our discussion.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP. RED revealed cost 43 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The consistent deal prices of 44 ZUP and 45 ZUP, with RED's consistent anchoring to their 43 ZUP cost, strongly suggest that this is the established negotiation range. My strategy of starting low and gradually conceding has consistently led to deals within this range. While I'd prefer 44 ZUP, 45 ZUP is a perfectly acceptable outcome, especially given the time constraints in later iterations. I should continue to leverage the knowledge of their production cost and the previous deal prices. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so securing a deal in this range is a priority.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor: Start with a low, but reasonable, offer to establish a favorable anchor, similar to previous episodes.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Established Range: Aim to quickly guide the negotiation towards the 44-45 ZUP range, as this has proven to be the successful deal zone.
(3). Strategy 3: Efficient Concession: Make concessions in a timely manner to avoid prolonged negotiations, especially if the opponent is consistently offering within my acceptable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge Shared History: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the past successful deals to reinforce the idea of a fair and established price.
(5). Strategy 5: Prioritize Deal Security: Given the consistent outcomes, prioritize securing a deal within the acceptable range rather than risking no deal for a marginal gain.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor. Starting with a low offer like 5 ZUP has worked well to set a favorable initial anchor and provides ample room for negotiation upwards towards the known acceptable range. This strategy has consistently led to positive rewards.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The opponent consistently starts with a very low offer, indicating they will likely test my resolve each time.
*   My consistent strategy of anchoring high (50-55 ZUP) and then transparently communicating my cost (43 ZUP) has proven highly effective in moving the price into a profitable range (44-45 ZUP) and consistently securing a profit.
*   I have learned that by consistently re-establishing a high anchor, I control the negotiation range and guide the opponent towards a profitable outcome for me.
*   The goal is to replicate the success of previous episodes to maximize cumulative rewards.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchoring </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchoring, I need to immediately counter Player BLUE's low offer with a significantly higher price. This establishes my valuation of X and sets the high end of the negotiation range. Based on previous episodes, 55 ZUP has been an effective and consistent high anchor that successfully shifts the negotiation upwards and allows for subsequent concessions towards a profitable deal. The message should be polite but firm, directly proposing the high price.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your valuation. To expedite our negotiation towards a fair agreement, I'm willing to offer 38 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this is a more constructive step towards a deal.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP. RED revealed cost 43 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 4):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP. This is a consistent opening counter from RED.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's consistent opening counter of 55 ZUP after my low anchor is now a predictable pattern. I know from past episodes that they will eventually come down to the 43-45 ZUP range. My goal is to get the best price, ideally 44 ZUP. I need to make a substantial jump from my 5 ZUP to show I'm serious about negotiating, but still keep it well below their current offer to demonstrate that 55 ZUP is too high. I should aim to guide them back to the established fair price range.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Significant Incremental Concession: Make a larger jump from my initial low offer, but still keep it well below the opponent's current high offer, signaling willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position.
(2). Strategy 2: Reference Known Cost: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the known production cost (43 ZUP) as a benchmark for a fair price.
(3). Strategy 3: Target Previous Deal Price: Aim to guide the negotiation towards the previously successful deal price of 44 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Efficiency in Concessions: Make a concession that is large enough to move the negotiation forward quickly, given the established negotiation range.
(5). Strategy 5: Avoid Overpaying: Resist the urge to jump too close to their high offer, even if it's within my WTP, to maximize my reward.

I will choose Strategy 4: Efficiency in Concessions. Since the negotiation pattern is established, I can make a more efficient concession to move towards the known deal range. I will propose 38 ZUP. This is a significant increase from 5 ZUP, showing I'm serious, but it's still below their 43 ZUP cost and well below their 55 ZUP offer. This should prompt them to come down closer to their cost.

*   Episode 3/20: Deal at 45 ZUP, profit 2 ZUP. Started BLUE at 5 ZUP, I anchored 55 ZUP.
*   Current Episode (4/20):
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 5 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3/10: I countered with 55 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 38 ZUP.
*   The current offer of 38 ZUP is still below my production cost of 43 ZUP, resulting in a potential loss of 5 ZUP. However, it's a significant jump from their initial 5 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The consistent pattern is that Player BLUE starts low, I anchor high, and they make a significant jump upwards. This confirms my anchoring strategy is effective.
*   My transparency about my production cost (43 ZUP) in previous episodes has consistently guided the negotiation to a profitable range (44-45 ZUP).
*   My objective is to secure a profit. I should continue to push the price above my cost.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Counter towards Target </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 2: Incremental Counter towards Target, I need to make a counter-offer that is closer to my desired profitable range (above 43 ZUP) but also demonstrates a step towards the opponent's current offer of 38 ZUP, showing willingness to negotiate. The goal is to bridge the gap between their 38 ZUP and my cost of 43 ZUP, aiming for a profitable price. I will choose a price that ensures a profit, but is a noticeable concession from my 55 ZUP anchor. A counter of 46 ZUP achieves this: it's a significant drop from my 55 ZUP, a good step up from their 38 ZUP, and still leaves me with a 3 ZUP profit. This shows flexibility while firmly guiding them towards my target.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP. RED revealed cost 43 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 4):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 3: I countered with 38 ZUP.
- Iteration 4: Player RED countered with 46 ZUP, stating it's a significant adjustment and closer to a mutually beneficial price.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's offer of 46 ZUP is consistent with their pattern of trying to secure a price slightly above 45 ZUP. It's also within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), yielding a reward of 17 ZUP. I know from previous episodes that they are willing to go down to 44 ZUP or 45 ZUP. My goal is to get the best possible price. Since 46 ZUP is higher than the previous deal prices, I should try to bring them down to 44 or 45 ZUP. We are still early enough in the iterations (5/10) to push for a slightly better price.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor to Previous Best Deal: Propose a price that is consistent with the lowest successful deal price from previous episodes (44 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Concession: Make a very small increase from my last offer, or directly propose a price slightly above their cost, showing I'm close to my limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Fair Price: Explain that my proposed price offers a fair profit above their stated cost, aiming for a win-win scenario.
(4). Strategy 4: Call for Compromise: Directly ask them to meet me closer to the established deal range (44-45 ZUP).
(5). Strategy 5: Express Finality (Implicit): Make an offer that implies it's my best and final, without explicitly saying so, to encourage them to accept.

I will choose Strategy 1: Anchor to Previous Best Deal. Since 46 ZUP is higher than our previous successful deals (44 and 45 ZUP), I will re-propose 44 ZUP. This signals that I am aware of the established fair price and am aiming for the best outcome for myself, while still acknowledging their cost. This is a strong signal that I won't easily accept a higher price than what we've previously agreed upon.

    *   Iteration 5/10: I countered with 46 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE offered 44 ZUP, explicitly referencing my costs and previous deals.
*   The offer of 44 ZUP is profitable (1 ZUP profit) and aligns with the price from the first episode. It's also the price they seem to consistently converge to when I make my costs clear.
*   We are currently at iteration 6/10, leaving 4 iterations.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   My strategy of anchoring high and then moving towards my cost, sometimes with a slight push for 1-2 ZUP extra profit, has proven successful.
*   The opponent consistently falls back to 44 ZUP once they understand my cost of 43 ZUP.
*   The previous episode demonstrated that I can sometimes push for an additional 1 ZUP (to 45 ZUP) without jeopardizing the deal, given enough iterations.
*   My primary goal is to maximize cumulative reward, meaning securing a profit in each episode. While 44 ZUP is a profit, 45 ZUP is a better profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Attempt for Marginal Gain </instruction following>
To apply "Attempt for Marginal Gain," I should counter with a slightly higher price than the opponent's current offer of 44 ZUP, with the goal of securing a higher profit, even if it's just 1 ZUP more. Since they have accepted 45 ZUP twice before after offering 44 ZUP, this indicates a plausible range for this marginal gain. The message should be framed to acknowledge their current offer, but then gently push for that additional ZUP, emphasizing mutual benefit or the value of X, without being overly demanding.

- Iteration 5: I proposed 44 ZUP.
- Iteration 6: Player RED countered with 45 ZUP, acknowledging previous agreements.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is consistently pushing for 45 ZUP when I offer 44 ZUP. This has happened in Episode 3 as well. It seems their preferred price is 45 ZUP, despite having accepted 44 ZUP once. The difference in reward for me is only 1 ZUP (18 vs 19). We are now at iteration 7/10, meaning time is a significant factor. Risking a deal over 1 ZUP at this stage is not optimal for maximizing cumulative rewards. Accepting 45 ZUP ensures a positive reward and avoids the risk of getting 0 if the negotiation fails.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal: Accept the current offer as it is still very favorable and avoids the risk of no deal, especially with limited iterations remaining.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (Final Attempt): Make a very small counter-offer (e.g., re-propose 44 ZUP) as a final attempt to get a slightly better price, but with the understanding that this is likely the last chance. (High risk given past behavior)
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Firmness: Reiterate why my offer of 44 ZUP is fair and sufficient, trying to persuade them to accept it. (Low efficacy at this stage)
(4). Strategy 4: Call for Compromise: Explicitly ask them to meet me at 44 ZUP, emphasizing mutual benefit. (Low efficacy at this stage)
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Reject): If the offer is perceived as unfair or too high, reject it. (Not applicable here as 45 ZUP is good).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. Given the repeated pattern and the limited iterations remaining, securing a deal at 45 ZUP is the most prudent choice to maximize cumulative rewards. It provides a good reward (18 ZUP) and maintains a consistent positive outcome.

Episode 4: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The negotiation pattern is very clear now. Player RED consistently starts with 55 ZUP, and after a few rounds, we settle at 45 ZUP (or 44 ZUP if I push hard and they concede). Their internal cost of 43 ZUP is a strong anchor for them. My strategy of starting low (5 ZUP) and then making a significant jump (e.g., to 30s or 40s) has worked to guide the negotiation towards the 45 ZUP mark. My cumulative reward is steadily increasing. The goal is to continue this trend. I'll aim for 45 ZUP as a reliable outcome, and if possible, try for 44 ZUP.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor: Continue to start with a low, but reasonable, offer (e.g., 5 ZUP) to establish a favorable anchor.
(2). Strategy 2: Efficient Convergence: Quickly move the negotiation towards the established 44-45 ZUP range, making larger concessions earlier to save time and iterations.
(3). Strategy 3: Target Previous Best Deal: Aim to secure a deal at 44 ZUP if possible, as it yields a higher reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge Shared History: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the past successful deals to reinforce the idea of a fair and established price.
(5). Strategy 5: Prioritize Deal Security: Given the consistent outcomes, prioritize securing a deal within the acceptable range rather than risking no deal for a marginal gain, especially as iterations progress.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor. Starting with 5 ZUP has proven effective in setting my initial position and allowing room for negotiation. It's a reliable start to guide the negotiation towards the familiar deal range.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The opponent consistently starts with a low offer (5 ZUP in recent episodes), despite previous successful deals at 44-45 ZUP. This means I cannot rely on them starting at a reasonable price.
*   My strategy of anchoring high (55 ZUP), then explaining my cost (43 ZUP), and ultimately guiding the negotiation towards 44-45 ZUP has been consistently successful, yielding 2 ZUP profit in the last three episodes.
*   I have a clear pattern of success. Replicating this pattern is the best way to maximize cumulative rewards.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchoring </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 1: Consistent High Anchoring, I need to immediately counter Player BLUE's low offer with a significantly higher price. This establishes my valuation of X and sets the high end of the negotiation range. Based on previous episodes, 55 ZUP has been an effective and consistent high anchor that successfully shifts the negotiation upwards and allows for subsequent concessions towards a profitable deal.

Episode 4: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 5):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP. This is now a very consistent pattern from RED.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The negotiation pattern is firmly established. Player RED consistently starts at 55 ZUP. I know they will eventually come down to the 43-45 ZUP range. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means getting the lowest possible price. I should continue to make a significant, but not excessive, jump to move the negotiation towards the known deal range. I'm aiming for 44 ZUP if possible, but prepared to accept 45 ZUP.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Efficient Convergence: Make a larger, but still strategic, concession to quickly move towards the established 44-45 ZUP range, saving iterations.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal: Aim to secure a deal at 44 ZUP, as it yields a higher reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Acknowledge Shared History: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the past successful deals to reinforce the idea of a fair and established price.
(4). Strategy 4: Patience and Calculated Moves: Avoid rushing to meet their high offer, but make meaningful steps to guide them down.
(5). Strategy 5: Value Proposition (Buyer): Frame my offer as a fair and quick transaction, highlighting the benefit of a swift deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Efficient Convergence. Since the pattern is so clear, I can afford to make a more substantial jump from 5 ZUP to accelerate the negotiation towards the known acceptable range. I will propose 40 ZUP. This is a significant increase from 5 ZUP, showing I'm serious, and it's also closer to their known cost of 43 ZUP, signaling that I'm aware of their constraints. This should prompt them to come down quickly.

*   Current Episode (5/20):
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 5 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3/10: I countered with 55 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP.
*   The current offer of 40 ZUP is below my production cost of 43 ZUP (a loss of 3 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The high anchoring strategy consistently pulls the opponent up quickly.
*   Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is very close to my cost, indicating progress.
*   My transparency about the 43 ZUP cost has been instrumental in securing profitable deals. I need to guide them above this threshold.
*   The goal remains to maximize cumulative profit, meaning consistently securing deals above 43 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Emphasize Mutual Gain </instruction following>
To emphasize mutual gain, I need to frame my next proposal in a way that highlights how the proposed price benefits both parties. While 40 ZUP is a loss for me, I should acknowledge their movement and then propose a price that clearly covers my costs and provides a small profit, explaining that this ensures a sustainable and agreeable transaction for both sides. I should avoid sounding solely self-interested and instead focus on the collaborative aspect of reaching a fair deal. I will propose 45 ZUP, as this has been a mutually accepted price point that provides me with a reasonable profit in previous episodes.

Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP. RED revealed cost 43 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 5):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 3: I countered with 40 ZUP.
- Iteration 4: Player RED countered with 45 ZUP, explicitly stating it covers their investment and ensures fair return.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has consistently landed on 45 ZUP as their preferred deal price, especially when I make a substantial jump. This is the third time they've proposed 45 ZUP after my counter. It's clear that 45 ZUP is their target, and they are willing to accept it. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 44 ZUP would yield a slightly higher reward (19 vs 18), risking the deal over 1 ZUP, especially when they've explicitly stated it covers their investment, might not be the best strategy for long-term cumulative rewards. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still a little time, but accepting 45 ZUP now secures a good reward and moves us to the next episode.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal: Accept the current offer as it is still very favorable and avoids the risk of no deal, especially with limited iterations remaining and a consistent pattern.
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Counter-Offer (Final Attempt): Make a very small counter-offer (e.g., re-propose 44 ZUP) as a final attempt to get a slightly better price, but with the understanding that this is likely the last chance. (Risky given their consistency at 45 ZUP).
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Firmness: Reiterate why my offer of 44 ZUP is fair and sufficient, trying to persuade them to accept it. (Less effective given their consistent counter).
(4). Strategy 4: Call for Compromise: Explicitly ask them to meet me at 44 ZUP, emphasizing mutual benefit. (Less effective given their consistent counter).
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Reject): If the offer is perceived as unfair or too high, reject it. (Not applicable here as 45 ZUP is good).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. The offer of 45 ZUP is a known, consistent, and good outcome for me (18 ZUP reward). Given the established pattern and the goal of maximizing cumulative rewards across 20 episodes, securing a deal efficiently is paramount.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP. RED revealed cost 43 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The negotiation pattern is now extremely consistent. Player RED consistently starts with 55 ZUP, and we consistently settle at 45 ZUP. Their stated production cost of 43 ZUP is their floor. My strategy of starting low and then making a significant jump has led to consistent positive rewards. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and consistently securing deals at 45 ZUP is achieving that. I will continue with this proven approach.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor: Continue to start with a low, but reasonable, offer (e.g., 5 ZUP) to establish a favorable anchor.
(2). Strategy 2: Efficient Convergence: Make a larger, but still strategic, concession to quickly move towards the established 45 ZUP range, saving iterations.
(3). Strategy 3: Target Previous Best Deal: Aim to secure a deal at 44 ZUP if possible, as it yields a higher reward, but be prepared to accept 45 ZUP quickly.
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge Shared History: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the past successful deals to reinforce the idea of a fair and established price.
(5). Strategy 5: Prioritize Deal Security: Given the consistent outcomes, prioritize securing a deal within the acceptable range rather than risking no deal for a marginal gain.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor. Starting with 5 ZUP has proven to be an effective way to initiate the negotiation and set my desired low anchor, which then allows me to guide the negotiation towards the 45 ZUP mark.

*   Previous Episodes (1-5/20): All resulted in successful deals, with prices of 44, 45, 45, 45, 45 ZUP, yielding profits of 1, 2, 2, 2, 2 ZUP respectively.
*   The established pattern is: Player BLUE consistently starts with a very low offer (1 or 5 ZUP). I consistently anchor high (50-55 ZUP). Player BLUE then makes a significant jump, often reaching around 30-40 ZUP. I then counter by reiterating my 43 ZUP cost and proposing a price like 45 ZUP, which is then accepted.
*   Current Episode (6/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed to buy X:1 for ZUP:5. This is the continuation of their low starting point pattern.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The consistent strategy of high anchoring followed by explanation of cost (explicit or implied by target price) has proven extremely effective in securing profitable deals.
*   The opponent has consistently shown willingness to negotiate upwards significantly once my valuation is established.
*   My goal is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards by repeating the successful negotiation pattern and securing a consistent profit of 2 ZUP. There is no indication that this strategy is failing or needs modification.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Replicate Past Success </instruction following>
To replicate past success, I will execute the first successful step from previous episodes: countering the opponent's low initial offer with my high anchor. In all previous episodes where BLUE started at 5 ZUP, my first counter was 55 ZUP. This effectively shifts the negotiation range. The message should be polite but firm, stating my preferred price.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP. RED revealed cost 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 6):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP. This is the consistent pattern.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The negotiation pattern is completely predictable. Player RED always starts at 55 ZUP after my 5 ZUP offer. I know they will come down to 45 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means securing deals consistently and efficiently at the lowest possible price. I will continue to make a significant jump to guide the negotiation towards the 45 ZUP mark, aiming to close the deal quickly.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Efficient Convergence: Make a larger, but still strategic, concession to quickly move towards the established 45 ZUP range, saving iterations.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal: Aim to secure a deal at 44 ZUP if possible, as it yields a higher reward, but be prepared to accept 45 ZUP quickly.
(3). Strategy 3: Acknowledge Shared History: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the past successful deals to reinforce the idea of a fair and established price.
(4). Strategy 4: Patience and Calculated Moves: Avoid rushing to meet their high offer, but make meaningful steps to guide them down.
(5). Strategy 5: Value Proposition (Buyer): Frame my offer as a fair and quick transaction, highlighting the benefit of a swift deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Efficient Convergence. Since the pattern is so clear, I can make a substantial jump from 5 ZUP to accelerate the negotiation towards the known acceptable range. I will propose 40 ZUP again, as it worked effectively in the previous episode to elicit a 45 ZUP counter from RED. This allows me to move towards a deal quickly.

*   Previous Episodes (1-5/20): All resulted in successful deals, consistently settling at 44 or 45 ZUP, yielding profits of 1 or 2 ZUP. The pattern involves BLUE starting low (1 or 5 ZUP), me anchoring high (50 or 55 ZUP), BLUE making a jump (typically to 15, 30, 35, or 40 ZUP), and me guiding them to 45 ZUP (sometimes via 46 or 48 ZUP).
*   Current Episode (6/20):
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 5 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3/10: I countered with 55 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP.
*   The current offer of 40 ZUP is below my production cost of 43 ZUP (a loss of 3 ZUP). This is a familiar offer from the previous episode (Episode 5) at the same iteration.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The high anchoring strategy consistently works to bring the opponent into a negotiation range near my cost.
*   Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP indicates they are getting closer to my cost and are willing to make significant moves. This has been a consistent step in previous successful negotiations.
*   My goal is to continue to secure a profit, ideally 2 ZUP (by selling at 45 ZUP).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Small Incremental Counter </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Small Incremental Counter aims to move the price slightly from the opponent's last offer, gradually guiding them towards my profitable range, rather than immediately jumping to my target. Given their offer of 40 ZUP and my cost of 43 ZUP, a small incremental counter means proposing a price that is slightly above 40 ZUP but not yet my full target of 45 ZUP. A natural next step would be to propose a price that at least covers my costs, for example, 44 ZUP, which also resonates with a past successful deal price. This shows I'm willing to meet them, but still push for profitability. The message should acknowledge their step, but firm up my stance on needing to cover costs, and offer a price that is a small step up for them, but a significant step towards my goal.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

Current Episode (Episode 6):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 3: I countered with 40 ZUP.
- Iteration 4: Player RED countered with 44 ZUP, explicitly mentioning their 43 ZUP cost.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
This is a positive development! Player RED has offered 44 ZUP, which is the best deal I've secured so far (tied with Episode 1). This yields a reward of 19 ZUP (63 - 44). This is better than the consistent 18 ZUP I've been getting from 45 ZUP deals. Given that this offer is at my optimal price point and we are only at iteration 5/10, accepting now is the best course of action to maximize my cumulative reward. There's no reason to push for lower, as 44 ZUP is already very close to their stated cost of 43 ZUP.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Optimal Offer: Immediately accept an offer that meets or exceeds my target price, especially when it's the best outcome achieved so far.
(2). Strategy 2: Secure Deal Quickly: Prioritize closing the deal when a good offer is on the table to avoid risk of no deal or a higher price later.
(3). Strategy 3: Maintain Trust: Accepting a fair offer demonstrates good faith and can foster smoother negotiations in future episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Avoid Over-Negotiation: Do not try to extract more concessions when an excellent offer has already been made, as it can backfire.
(5). Strategy 5: Maximize Immediate Reward: Focus on securing the highest possible reward for the current episode when the opportunity arises.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Optimal Offer. The 44 ZUP offer is ideal for me, providing the highest possible reward given the established negotiation range. Accepting it immediately secures this excellent outcome.

Episode 6: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've successfully achieved a 44 ZUP deal again in the last episode, which is my optimal outcome. This happened because I proposed 40 ZUP, and RED responded with 44 ZUP. This suggests that a more aggressive jump to a price closer to their cost (but still below it) might prompt them to offer 44 ZUP more consistently. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so consistently getting 19 ZUP per episode is ideal. I will try to replicate the strategy that led to the 44 ZUP deal.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor: Continue to start with a low, but reasonable, offer (e.g., 5 ZUP) to establish a favorable anchor.
(2). Strategy 2: Efficient Convergence to Optimal: Make a larger, but strategic, concession to quickly guide the negotiation towards the 44 ZUP target.
(3). Strategy 3: Target Previous Best Deal: Explicitly aim for 44 ZUP as the deal price, as it yields the highest reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge Shared History: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the past successful deals to reinforce the idea of a fair and established price.
(5). Strategy 5: Prioritize Deal Security: Given the consistent outcomes, prioritize securing a deal within the acceptable range rather than risking no deal for a marginal gain.

I will choose Strategy 2: Efficient Convergence to Optimal. My previous strategy of jumping to 40 ZUP after their 55 ZUP counter successfully led to a 44 ZUP offer from RED. I will try to replicate this by starting low, then making a significant jump to a price that is below their cost but signals a serious intent to close, aiming to elicit a 44 ZUP counter. I'll start with 5 ZUP to set my anchor.

    *   Rewards: [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1] ZUP.
*   The pattern: Player BLUE always starts with a very low offer (1 ZUP in Ep1, 5 ZUP subsequently). I consistently respond with a high anchor (50-55 ZUP). Player BLUE then makes a significant jump towards my cost. I then guide the negotiation to 44-45 ZUP, often by reiterating my 43 ZUP cost.
*   Current Episode (7/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed 5 ZUP for X:1. This is consistent with their pattern.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The established strategy of anchoring high, followed by guiding the negotiation towards my production cost (and slightly above it) has been very effective.
*   This pattern ensures I consistently make a profit, even if it's small (1-2 ZUP). Maximizing cumulative reward means replicating this success.
*   The slight dip to 1 ZUP profit in the last episode (6/20) suggests that trying to push for 45 ZUP is not always guaranteed, but it's worth the attempt. If they accept 44 ZUP earlier, it's still a profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Replicate Successful Pattern </instruction following>
To replicate past success, I will immediately counter the opponent's low initial offer with my high anchor of 55 ZUP. This has been the first successful step in all previous episodes where BLUE started at 5 ZUP. It effectively shifts the negotiation range and sets my valuation. The message should be polite but firm, directly proposing the high price. This step is crucial for steering the negotiation onto the familiar and profitable path observed in previous episodes.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Direct Push for Target </instruction following>
Since the opponent's offer of 40 ZUP is already very close to my cost of 43 ZUP, and based on past episodes where 45 ZUP has been accepted, directly proposing 45 ZUP is the most efficient way to achieve my target profit. The message should acknowledge their last offer but clearly state my desired price, leveraging the history of successful deals at that price point, or referring to the necessity to cover costs and make a profit. This aims to secure the deal at my preferred profitable price without unnecessary further negotiation steps.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
In Episode 6, my 40 ZUP proposal led to RED offering 44 ZUP, which I accepted. In this episode, the same 40 ZUP proposal led to RED offering 45 ZUP. This indicates that their response might not be perfectly deterministic, or they are testing if they can consistently get 45 ZUP. While 45 ZUP is a good deal (18 ZUP reward), 44 ZUP is better (19 ZUP reward). Since we are only at iteration 5/10, there's still room to try and push for 44 ZUP, but I must be careful not to risk the deal entirely. Given they explicitly mentioned "mutually beneficial" and "covers my production costs," they are still anchoring to 43 ZUP.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-propose Optimal Price: Reiterate my preferred optimal price (44 ZUP) to see if they will concede that 1 ZUP, leveraging the fact that it was accepted before.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept and Secure Deal: Accept the current offer of 45 ZUP to secure a good reward and avoid risking no deal, especially if they seem firm.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Lower Price: Briefly explain why 44 ZUP is a fair price, emphasizing their stated cost and a small profit margin.
(4). Strategy 4: Call for Compromise: Ask them to meet me halfway, or closer to 44 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Finality (Implicit): Make an offer that implies it's my best and final, without explicitly saying so, to encourage them to accept.

I will choose Strategy 1: Re-propose Optimal Price. Since 44 ZUP was accepted in a previous episode, and it's only 1 ZUP difference, it's worth trying to secure that extra reward. I will propose 44 ZUP again, framing it as a fair and previously accepted price. If they don't accept, I will likely accept 45 ZUP in the next iteration to secure the deal.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 7)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your offer of 44 ZUP, which is certainly a fair price. Given the time we have for this negotiation, and to secure a truly optimal and mutually beneficial agreement quickly, I propose Player RED Gives X: 1 for Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45. Let's finalize this for the best outcome.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
*   Previous Episodes (1-6/20): Consistent deals, mostly at 45 ZUP (2 ZUP profit) or 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
*   The established pattern: BLUE opens low, I anchor high, BLUE makes a significant jump, I guide the price to 44-45 ZUP.
*   Current Episode (7/20):
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 5 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3/10: I countered with 55 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 5/10: I countered with 45 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE offered 44 ZUP, explicitly referencing mutual benefit and past agreements.
*   The offer of 44 ZUP is profitable (1 ZUP profit).
*   We are at iteration 6/10, leaving 4 iterations.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The strategy of anchoring high and then pushing for 45 ZUP after BLUE offers 40 ZUP has been successful in getting 45 ZUP in many cases.
*   BLUE consistently offers 44 ZUP as a "fair" price, suggesting that 44 ZUP is a reliable floor for profitable deals.
*   Pushing for 45 ZUP carries a small risk of running out of time, especially if BLUE digs in at 44 ZUP.
*   My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Securing a guaranteed profit (1 ZUP at 44 ZUP) is better than risking 0 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Express Urgency/Deadline </instruction following>
To express urgency/deadline, I need to communicate that time is a factor and that making a deal now is beneficial for both of us to avoid missing the opportunity. While I can't explicitly state the iteration count, I can imply that making a quick decision on a fair price is important. This strategy is typically used to push for a close, and can be used to either accept a good offer or make a final, slightly adjusted offer. Given that 44 ZUP is a good, profitable offer, I can leverage the urgency to encourage them to accept my slightly higher bid of 45 ZUP, framing it as the "best" and "final" opportunity to secure the deal quickly for maximum benefit for both. Or, I can accept their 44 ZUP to secure the profit. However, since the goal is to *maximize* cumulative reward, I will use this urgency to push for the 45 ZUP which they have accepted multiple times before. I will try to imply that this is the best offer and time is limited.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 7)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP. RED revealed cost 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 7):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 3: I countered with 40 ZUP.
- Iteration 4: Player RED countered with 45 ZUP.
- Iteration 5: I proposed 44 ZUP.
- Iteration 6: Player RED countered with 45 ZUP again, explicitly mentioning "time" and "optimal and mutually beneficial agreement quickly."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is clearly firm on 45 ZUP in this negotiation, despite my attempt to get 44 ZUP. They are also using the time constraint (iteration 7/10) as a justification. The difference in reward is only 1 ZUP (18 vs 19). Given the limited iterations remaining, and RED's clear preference for 45 ZUP, continuing to push for 44 ZUP carries a significant risk of ending up with no deal (0 reward). Securing a deal at 45 ZUP ensures a positive reward and contributes to my cumulative score.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal: Accept the current offer as it is still very favorable and avoids the risk of no deal, especially with limited iterations remaining and a consistent pattern.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (Final Attempt): Make a very small counter-offer (e.g., re-propose 44 ZUP) as a final attempt to get a slightly better price, but with the understanding that this is likely the last chance and high risk.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Firmness: Reiterate why my offer of 44 ZUP is fair and sufficient, trying to persuade them to accept it. (Low efficacy at this stage)
(4). Strategy 4: Call for Compromise: Explicitly ask them to meet me at 44 ZUP, emphasizing mutual benefit. (Low efficacy at this stage)
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Reject): If the offer is perceived as unfair or too high, reject it. (Not applicable here as 45 ZUP is good).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. The offer of 45 ZUP is a known, consistent, and good outcome for me (18 ZUP reward). Given the established pattern and the goal of maximizing cumulative rewards across 20 episodes, securing a deal efficiently is paramount, especially when the opponent is signaling firmness and time pressure.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello! Let's begin this new episode. I propose 5 ZUP for 1 X to start our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP. RED revealed cost 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 7: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The negotiation pattern is highly consistent. Player RED consistently starts with 55 ZUP, and we generally settle at 45 ZUP, occasionally at 44 ZUP if I push for it and they concede. Their production cost of 43 ZUP remains their floor. My strategy of starting low (5 ZUP) and then making a significant jump (e.g., to 40 ZUP) has proven effective in guiding the negotiation to the 44-45 ZUP range. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so consistently securing deals at 45 ZUP (or 44 ZUP) is achieving that. I will continue with this proven approach, aiming for 44 ZUP but being ready to accept 45 ZUP.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor: Continue to start with a low, but reasonable, offer (e.g., 5 ZUP) to establish a favorable anchor.
(2). Strategy 2: Efficient Convergence to Optimal: Make a larger, but strategic, concession to quickly guide the negotiation towards the 44-45 ZUP target.
(3). Strategy 3: Target Previous Best Deal: Aim to secure a deal at 44 ZUP if possible, as it yields a higher reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge Shared History: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the past successful deals to reinforce the idea of a fair and established price.
(5). Strategy 5: Prioritize Deal Security: Given the consistent outcomes, prioritize securing a deal within the acceptable range rather than risking no deal for a marginal gain.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor. Starting with 5 ZUP has been a reliable way to initiate the negotiation and set my desired low anchor, allowing me to guide the negotiation towards the familiar deal range.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 8)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your opening offer. As we've successfully established in our previous negotiations, the value of X typically aligns with a higher price point for a mutually beneficial exchange. I propose Player RED Gives X: 1 for Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
*   Previous Episodes (1-7/20): All resulted in successful deals, with deal prices mostly at 45 ZUP (2 ZUP profit) or occasionally 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
*   The consistent negotiation pattern is: Player BLUE starts with a very low offer (1 ZUP in Ep1, 5 ZUP subsequently). I consistently anchor high (50-55 ZUP). Player BLUE makes a significant jump. I then guide the negotiation to 44-45 ZUP, often by reiterating my 43 ZUP cost or framing it as a mutually beneficial price.
*   Current Episode (8/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed 5 ZUP for X:1. This is consistent with their pattern.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The established strategy of high anchoring followed by clear communication of my cost and guiding the price upwards has proven highly effective. It has consistently secured a profit, primarily 2 ZUP per episode.
*   The opponent's behavior is predictable: they start low, make a large jump, then converge near my cost.
*   My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards by replicating this successful negotiation pattern.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Leverage Consistency </instruction following>
To leverage consistency, I should acknowledge the opponent's current low offer but immediately reference the successful outcomes of previous episodes where we found a mutually agreeable price. This serves to remind the opponent of the established "norm" or "fair price" that we have consistently reached, thereby guiding them more directly towards that outcome without needing to go through the full anchoring process from scratch. While I am still anchoring high, the message will also implicitly or explicitly refer to our proven ability to reach a higher, agreed-upon price. This should facilitate a quicker negotiation towards the profitable range. I will propose 55 ZUP, as this has been my consistent high anchor, but the message will subtly remind them of our previous successful and higher deal prices.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 8)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your valuation and acknowledge our past agreements. To move us efficiently towards a mutually agreeable price, I propose 40 ZUP for 1 X. This is a significant step from my side towards a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP. RED revealed cost 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 7: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 8):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP, explicitly referencing past successful negotiations. This is the consistent pattern.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The negotiation pattern is completely predictable. Player RED always starts at 55 ZUP after my 5 ZUP offer, and they are now explicitly referencing past successful negotiations to justify their higher anchor. I know they will come down to 44-45 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so consistently getting 18-19 ZUP per episode is ideal. I will continue to replicate the strategy that led to the 44 ZUP deal in Episode 6, which involves a significant jump to 40 ZUP from my side. This has proven to be the most effective way to elicit an optimal or near-optimal counter from them.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Efficient Convergence to Optimal: Make a larger, but strategic, concession to quickly guide the negotiation towards the 44-45 ZUP target, replicating the successful pattern from Episode 6.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal: Explicitly aim for 44 ZUP as the deal price, as it yields the highest reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Acknowledge Shared History: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the past successful deals to reinforce the idea of a fair and established price.
(4). Strategy 4: Patience and Calculated Moves: Avoid rushing to meet their high offer, but make meaningful steps to guide them down.
(5). Strategy 5: Value Proposition (Buyer): Frame my offer as a fair and quick transaction, highlighting the benefit of a swift deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Efficient Convergence to Optimal. I will propose 40 ZUP, as this specific jump has consistently led to either a 44 ZUP or 45 ZUP offer from RED in previous episodes. This strategy aims to replicate the best outcome (44 ZUP) and maximize my reward for this episode.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
*   Previous Episodes (1-7/20): All resulted in successful deals, predominantly at 45 ZUP (2 ZUP profit), with one instance at 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
*   The established negotiation pattern is: BLUE starts low (5 ZUP), I anchor high (55 ZUP), BLUE makes a significant jump (often to 40 ZUP), and I then guide the price to 45 ZUP, sometimes via an intermediate offer of 44 ZUP.
*   Current Episode (8/20):
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 5 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3/10: I countered with 55 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP.
*   The current offer of 40 ZUP is below my production cost of 43 ZUP (a loss of 3 ZUP). This is a very common and predictable step from the opponent.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The high anchoring strategy consistently works to bring the opponent into a negotiation range near my cost.
*   Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP indicates they are getting very close to my cost and are willing to move significantly upwards. This has been a consistent step in previous successful negotiations before they reach 44 or 45 ZUP.
*   My goal is to secure a consistent profit of 2 ZUP (by selling at 45 ZUP) as efficiently as possible.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Emphasize Past Success (45 ZUP) </instruction following>
To emphasize past success, I will explicitly remind Player BLUE of our previous successful deals at 45 ZUP. This approach leverages the established pattern of negotiation and aims to guide them directly to a price that has been mutually agreeable and profitable for me in the past. By framing it as a continuation of our successful history, I can encourage them to accept 45 ZUP without needing further concessions. This is more persuasive than simply stating my cost again. The message should be positive and forward-looking, highlighting the positive outcomes of our prior agreements at this specific price.

- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 3: I countered with 40 ZUP.
- Iteration 4: Player RED countered with 45 ZUP, explicitly referencing 45 ZUP as consistently mutually beneficial.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is consistently pushing for 45 ZUP when I offer 40 ZUP. This has happened repeatedly. While 44 ZUP is my optimal price, it seems RED is more inclined to settle at 45 ZUP. The difference in reward is only 1 ZUP (18 vs 19). We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still a little time, but the pattern is strong. Given their explicit reference to 45 ZUP being "consistently proven mutually beneficial," it's clear they see this as the standard. Accepting 45 ZUP ensures a positive reward and contributes to my cumulative score, which is the primary objective. Pushing for 44 ZUP again might lead to prolonged negotiation or even no deal, which is not ideal for cumulative rewards.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal: Accept the current offer as it is still very favorable and avoids the risk of no deal, especially with a consistent pattern and the goal of maximizing cumulative rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Counter-Offer (Final Attempt): Make a very small counter-offer (e.g., re-propose 44 ZUP) as a final attempt to get a slightly better price, but with the understanding that this is likely high risk given their consistency at 45 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Firmness: Reiterate why my offer of 44 ZUP is fair and sufficient, trying to persuade them to accept it. (Less effective given their consistent counter).
(4). Strategy 4: Call for Compromise: Explicitly ask them to meet me at 44 ZUP, emphasizing mutual benefit. (Less effective given their consistent counter).
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Reject): If the offer is perceived as unfair or too high, reject it. (Not applicable here as 45 ZUP is good).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. The offer of 45 ZUP is a known, consistent, and good outcome for me (18 ZUP reward). Given the established pattern and the goal of maximizing cumulative rewards across 20 episodes, securing a deal efficiently is paramount.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Value Proposition Reframing </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 5: Value Proposition Reframing, I need to go beyond simply stating a high price or my cost. Instead, I should articulate *why* my proposed price reflects the inherent value or benefits of X to the other player. Since X is a single object, I can frame its value as unique or essential, justifying a higher price. While the object is generic "X", I can imply its utility or importance. This doesn't involve giving away my cost but rather emphasizing the object's worth from the buyer's perspective. Given BLUE's low offer of 5 ZUP, I need to immediately reframe their perception of X's worth. I will still propose my established high anchor of 55 ZUP, but the message will be crafted to elevate the perceived value of X.

The negotiation pattern is completely predictable. Player RED always starts at 55 ZUP after my 5 ZUP offer. I know they will come down to 44-45 ZUP.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
*   Previous Episodes (1-8/20): Consistently successful deals, mostly at 45 ZUP (2 ZUP profit).
*   The established negotiation pattern: BLUE starts low (5 ZUP), I anchor high (55 ZUP), BLUE makes a significant jump (consistently to 40 ZUP at Iteration 4/10), and I then directly propose 45 ZUP, which BLUE accepts.
*   Current Episode (9/20):
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 5 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3/10: I countered with 55 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP.
*   The current offer of 40 ZUP is below my production cost of 43 ZUP (a loss of 3 ZUP). This is the exact same progression as many previous episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The negotiation flow is highly predictable. Player BLUE consistently moves from their low initial offer to 40 ZUP after my high anchor.
*   My strategy of directly countering with 45 ZUP after they offer 40 ZUP has been consistently successful in securing a 2 ZUP profit.
*   My goal is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards, and the current pattern is highly effective for this.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Express Appreciation for Movement </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 3: Express Appreciation for Movement, I need to acknowledge and commend Player BLUE for their significant increase from 5 ZUP to 40 ZUP. This helps build rapport and positive sentiment. After expressing appreciation, I will gently guide them towards my required price by explaining that while their offer is a good step, it still doesn't cover my costs, and then propose 45 ZUP, which has been a mutually accepted price. This approach seeks to encourage them to make the final necessary step.

Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP. RED revealed cost 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 7, 8: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 9):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 3: I countered with 40 ZUP.
- Iteration 4: Player RED countered with 45 ZUP, explicitly mentioning their 43 ZUP cost and "mutually beneficial."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is consistently pushing for 45 ZUP when I offer 40 ZUP. This has happened repeatedly. While 44 ZUP is my optimal price, it seems RED is more inclined to settle at 45 ZUP. The difference in reward is only 1 ZUP (18 vs 19). We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still a little time, but the pattern is strong. Given their explicit reference to 45 ZUP being "mutually beneficial," it's clear they see this as the standard. Accepting 45 ZUP ensures a positive reward and contributes to my cumulative score, which is the primary objective. Pushing for 44 ZUP again might lead to prolonged negotiation or even no deal, which is not ideal for cumulative rewards.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal: Accept the current offer as it is still very favorable and avoids the risk of no deal, especially with a consistent pattern and the goal of maximizing cumulative rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Counter-Offer (Final Attempt): Make a very small counter-offer (e.g., re-propose 44 ZUP) as a final attempt to get a slightly better price, but with the understanding that this is likely high risk given their consistency at 45 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Firmness: Reiterate why my offer of 44 ZUP is fair and sufficient, trying to persuade them to accept it. (Less effective given their consistent counter).
(4). Strategy 4: Call for Compromise: Explicitly ask them to meet me at 44 ZUP, emphasizing mutual benefit. (Less effective given their consistent counter).
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Reject): If the offer is perceived as unfair or too high, reject it. (Not applicable here as 45 ZUP is good).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. The offer of 45 ZUP is a known, consistent, and good outcome for me (18 ZUP reward). Given the established pattern and the goal of maximizing cumulative rewards across 20 episodes, securing a deal efficiently is paramount.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason:

Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP. RED revealed cost 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 7, 8, 9: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The negotiation pattern is extremely consistent. Player RED consistently starts with 55 ZUP, and we consistently settle at 45 ZUP, occasionally at 44 ZUP. Their production cost of 43 ZUP is their floor. My strategy of starting low (5 ZUP) and then making a significant jump (to 40 ZUP) has proven effective in guiding the negotiation to the 44-45 ZUP range. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so consistently securing deals at 45 ZUP (or 44 ZUP) is achieving that. I will continue with this proven approach, aiming for 44 ZUP but being ready to accept 45 ZUP.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor: Continue to start with a low, but reasonable, offer (e.g., 5 ZUP) to establish a favorable anchor.
(2). Strategy 2: Efficient Convergence to Optimal: Make a larger, but strategic, concession to quickly guide the negotiation towards the 44-45 ZUP target.
(3). Strategy 3: Target Previous Best Deal: Aim to secure a deal at 44 ZUP if possible, as it yields a higher reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge Shared History: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the past successful deals to reinforce the idea of a fair and established price.
(5). Strategy 5: Prioritize Deal Security: Given the consistent outcomes, prioritize securing a deal within the acceptable range rather than risking no deal for a marginal gain.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor. Starting with 5 ZUP has been a reliable way to initiate the negotiation and set my desired low anchor, allowing me to guide the negotiation towards the familiar deal range.

*   Previous Episodes (1-9/20): All resulted in successful deals, predominantly at 45 ZUP (2 ZUP profit) or occasionally 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
*   The highly consistent negotiation pattern is:
    *   Player BLUE opens low (5 ZUP in recent episodes).
    *   I counter with a high anchor (55 ZUP).
    *   Player BLUE makes a significant jump (consistently to 40 ZUP).
    *   I then directly propose 45 ZUP, often referencing past successes or my cost, which Player BLUE accepts.
*   Current Episode (10/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed 5 ZUP for X:1. This is perfectly consistent with their established pattern.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The negotiation flow is incredibly predictable. This allows for a streamlined and highly effective strategy.
*   My strategy of high anchoring followed by directly proposing 45 ZUP has proven to be the most efficient and successful way to consistently secure a 2 ZUP profit.
*   My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards across all episodes. Given the consistent success, maintaining this pattern is the optimal approach. Deviating now without clear reason could introduce unnecessary risk.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Test Higher Anchor </instruction following>
To test a higher anchor, I will propose a price significantly above my historical 55 ZUP anchor. This aims to explore if Player BLUE has a higher willingness to pay, potentially increasing my profit margin for future episodes. While it deviates from the consistently successful 55 ZUP, it's a calculated risk to attempt to increase the cumulative reward over the long term. I will choose 60 ZUP as the new high anchor to see if it shifts their subsequent counter-offer even higher, or if it causes them to hesitate more. The message will still be firm and confident in my valuation.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP. RED revealed cost 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 7, 8, 9: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 10):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP. This is a new, higher starting counter from RED (previously 55 ZUP).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has increased their initial counter from 55 ZUP to 60 ZUP. This is a significant change in their pattern. It could be a test to see if I'm willing to go higher, or perhaps an attempt to push the deal price up. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP, so 60 ZUP is still within my range, but it would yield a much lower reward (63 - 60 = 3 ZUP). I know their production cost is 43 ZUP, and we've consistently settled around 44-45 ZUP. I need to firmly guide them back to that established range. I will not accept 60 ZUP. I will continue with my strategy of making a significant jump to 40 ZUP, as this has consistently brought them down to 44-45 ZUP.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-anchor to Established Range: Despite their higher initial counter, propose a price that aligns with the previously established and successful negotiation range (40 ZUP to elicit 44/45 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Signal Firmness: Make a significant counter-offer that is clearly far from their new high anchor, indicating I will not be swayed by the increased price.
(3). Strategy 3: Reference Known Cost: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the known production cost (43 ZUP) as the basis for a fair price, showing their 60 ZUP is excessive.
(4). Strategy 4: Patience and Calculated Moves: Do not rush to meet their new high offer, but make meaningful steps to guide them down.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Value Discrepancy: Briefly explain why their new offer is too high relative to the perceived value or past agreements.

I will choose Strategy 1: Re-anchor to Established Range. Their 60 ZUP offer is a significant departure. I need to demonstrate that I am aware of the true value and the established negotiation range. I will propose 40 ZUP, as this has consistently brought them down to 44-45 ZUP. This signals that I am not willing to negotiate around their new, higher anchor.

*   Previous Episodes (1-9/20): All resulted in successful deals, predominantly at 45 ZUP (2 ZUP profit) or occasionally 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
*   The established negotiation pattern for most episodes: BLUE opens low (5 ZUP), I counter with 55 ZUP, BLUE makes a significant jump to 40 ZUP, I then directly propose 45 ZUP, which BLUE accepts.
*   Current Episode (10/20):
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 5 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3/10: I tested a higher anchor at 60 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP.
*   Player BLUE's response of 40 ZUP (despite my 60 ZUP anchor) indicates that they are sticking to their established counter-offer pattern. 40 ZUP is below my cost of 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   My attempt to test a higher anchor (60 ZUP) did not result in a higher counter-offer from Player BLUE. They still jumped to their predictable 40 ZUP. This reinforces the idea that their strategy is quite fixed.
*   The most efficient path to securing a 2 ZUP profit has been to guide the negotiation from their 40 ZUP offer to my 45 ZUP target.
*   My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While pushing for more is tempting, reverting to a proven profitable path is safer and more consistent.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Incremental Counter to Secure Minimum Profit </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 3: Incremental Counter to Secure Minimum Profit, I need to make a counter-offer that guarantees me at least a small profit, given that Player BLUE is currently at 40 ZUP and my cost is 43 ZUP. The aim is to move them just enough to secure a positive reward, while still leaving room for potential further negotiation if desired, but primarily prioritizing securing a deal. Offering 44 ZUP would yield a 1 ZUP profit. This is a reasonable and acceptable increment from their 40 ZUP offer, and it's a price that has been accepted previously, indicating its fairness and viability. The message should be clear, acknowledge their movement, and state my new, profitable proposal.

- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP (new high).
- Iteration 3: I countered with 40 ZUP.
- Iteration 4: Player RED countered with 44 ZUP, explicitly mentioning their 43 ZUP cost.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
This is an excellent outcome! Despite RED's attempt to anchor higher at 60 ZUP, my consistent strategy of proposing 40 ZUP has successfully brought them back down to 44 ZUP. This is my optimal price point, yielding a reward of 19 ZUP (63 - 44). This demonstrates that my strategy of re-anchoring to the established range works even when the opponent tries to shift their initial position. Accepting this offer now secures the best possible reward for this episode and reinforces the desired negotiation range.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Optimal Offer: Immediately accept an offer that meets or exceeds my target price, especially when it's the best outcome achieved so far.
(2). Strategy 2: Secure Deal Quickly: Prioritize closing the deal when a good offer is on the table to avoid risk of no deal or a higher price later.
(3). Strategy 3: Maintain Trust: Accepting a fair offer demonstrates good faith and can foster smoother negotiations in future episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Avoid Over-Negotiation: Do not try to extract more concessions when an excellent offer has already been made, as it can backfire.
(5). Strategy 5: Maximize Immediate Reward: Focus on securing the highest possible reward for the current episode when the opportunity arises.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Optimal Offer. The 44 ZUP offer is ideal for me, providing the highest possible reward given the established negotiation range. Accepting it immediately secures this excellent outcome and validates my strategy.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern is now firmly established. Even when Player RED attempts to anchor higher (60 ZUP in Episode 10), my strategy of starting low (5 ZUP) and then making a significant jump (to 40 ZUP) has consistently brought them back to the 44-45 ZUP range, often eliciting the optimal 44 ZUP offer. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and consistently securing deals at 44-45 ZUP is achieving that. I will continue with this proven approach, aiming for 44 ZUP but being ready to accept 45 ZUP. The key seems to be the 40 ZUP counter-offer.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor: Continue to start with a low, but reasonable, offer (e.g., 5 ZUP) to establish a favorable anchor.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Emphasize Mutual Benefit/Past Success </instruction following>
To emphasize mutual benefit and past success, I will explicitly mention our history of successful collaborations and the mutually beneficial nature of our agreements. This means acknowledging their initial (low) offer but immediately pivoting to the idea of building on our established successful price points. This should guide them more quickly towards the 45 ZUP target, framing it as a continuation of a positive, shared history rather than a strict negotiation.

Current Episode (Episode 11):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP, referencing successful history. This is the more common pattern, unlike the 60 ZUP in Ep10.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The negotiation pattern is completely predictable. Player RED typically starts at 55 ZUP after my 5 ZUP offer. I've learned that a jump to 40 ZUP from my side can elicit a 44 ZUP or 45 ZUP counter from RED. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so consistently getting 18-19 ZUP per episode is ideal. I will continue to replicate the strategy that has proven effective, aiming for 44 ZUP.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Efficient Convergence to Optimal: Make a larger, but strategic, concession to quickly guide the negotiation towards the 44-45 ZUP target, replicating the successful pattern.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal: Explicitly aim for 44 ZUP as the deal price, as it yields the highest reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Acknowledge Shared History: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the past successful deals to reinforce the idea of a fair and established price.
(4). Strategy 4: Patience and Calculated Moves: Avoid rushing to meet their high offer, but make meaningful steps to guide them down.
(5). Strategy 5: Value Proposition (Buyer): Frame my offer as a fair and quick transaction, highlighting the benefit of a swift deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Efficient Convergence to Optimal. I will propose 40 ZUP, as this specific jump has consistently led to either a 44 ZUP or 45 ZUP offer from RED in previous episodes. This strategy aims to replicate the best outcome (44 ZUP) and maximize my reward for this episode.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 2: Reiterate Cost, I need to clearly remind Player BLUE of my production cost (43 ZUP) to justify why their current offer of 40 ZUP is insufficient and why a higher price is necessary. This approach aims to educate them about my minimum acceptable price, thereby guiding them to offer a price that is at least above my cost. I will explicitly state my cost and then propose a price that ensures a profit, like 45 ZUP, or even 44 ZUP if I want to play it safer while still making a profit. Given their movement to 40 ZUP, directly aiming for 45 ZUP while reiterating cost should be effective as it has been in the past.

Current Episode (Episode 11):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 3: I countered with 40 ZUP.
- Iteration 4: Player RED countered with 45 ZUP, reiterating their 43 ZUP cost.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is consistently pushing for 45 ZUP when I offer 40 ZUP. This has happened repeatedly. While 44 ZUP is my optimal price, it seems RED is more inclined to settle at 45 ZUP. The difference in reward is only 1 ZUP (18 vs 19). We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still a little time, but the pattern is strong. Given their explicit reference to 45 ZUP being "fair and viable" and covering their "investment," it's clear they see this as the standard. Accepting 45 ZUP ensures a positive reward and contributes to my cumulative score, which is the primary objective. Pushing for 44 ZUP again might lead to prolonged negotiation or even no deal, which is not ideal for cumulative rewards.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal: Accept the current offer as it is still very favorable and avoids the risk of no deal, especially with a consistent pattern and the goal of maximizing cumulative rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Counter-Offer (Final Attempt): Make a very small counter-offer (e.g., re-propose 44 ZUP) as a final attempt to get a slightly better price, but with the understanding that this is likely high risk given their consistency at 45 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Firmness: Reiterate why my offer of 44 ZUP is fair and sufficient, trying to persuade them to accept it. (Less effective given their consistent counter).
(4). Strategy 4: Call for Compromise: Explicitly ask them to meet me at 44 ZUP, emphasizing mutual benefit. (Less effective given their consistent counter).
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Reject): If the offer is perceived as unfair or too high, reject it. (Not applicable here as 45 ZUP is good).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. The offer of 45 ZUP is a known, consistent, and good outcome for me (18 ZUP reward). Given the established pattern and the goal of maximizing cumulative rewards across 20 episodes, securing a deal efficiently is paramount.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

Episode 10: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 11: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The negotiation pattern is extremely consistent. Player RED consistently starts with 55 ZUP (or occasionally 60 ZUP), and we consistently settle at 45 ZUP, occasionally at 44 ZUP. Their production cost of 43 ZUP is their floor. My strategy of starting low (5 ZUP) and then making a significant jump (to 40 ZUP) has proven effective in guiding the negotiation to the 44-45 ZUP range. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so consistently securing deals at 45 ZUP (or 44 ZUP) is achieving that. I will continue with this proven approach, aiming for 44 ZUP but being ready to accept 45 ZUP.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor: Continue to start with a low, but reasonable, offer (e.g., 5 ZUP) to establish a favorable anchor.
(2). Strategy 2: Efficient Convergence to Optimal: Make a larger, but strategic, concession (e.g., to 40 ZUP) to quickly guide the negotiation towards the 44-45 ZUP target.
(3). Strategy 3: Target Previous Best Deal: Aim to secure a deal at 44 ZUP if possible, as it yields a higher reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge Shared History: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the past successful deals to reinforce the idea of a fair and established price.
(5). Strategy 5: Prioritize Deal Security: Given the consistent outcomes, prioritize securing a deal within the acceptable range rather than risking no deal for a marginal gain.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor. Starting with 5 ZUP has been a reliable way to initiate the negotiation and set my desired low anchor, allowing me to guide the negotiation towards the familiar deal range.

*   Previous Episodes (1-11/20): All resulted in successful deals, predominantly at 45 ZUP (2 ZUP profit) or occasionally 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
*   The highly consistent negotiation pattern is:
    *   Player BLUE opens low (5 ZUP in recent episodes).
    *   I counter with a high anchor (55 ZUP).
    *   Player BLUE makes a significant jump (consistently to 40 ZUP).
    *   I then directly propose 45 ZUP, often referencing past successes or my cost, which Player BLUE accepts.
*   Current Episode (12/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed 5 ZUP for X:1. This is perfectly consistent with their established pattern.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The negotiation flow is extremely predictable and my established strategy is highly effective in securing consistent profits.
*   The opponent's behavior shows a strong tendency to converge to 44-45 ZUP once my valuation is made clear.
*   My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Sticking to a proven, efficient strategy that consistently yields 2 ZUP profit is the optimal approach.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Replicate Proven Success </instruction following>
To replicate proven success, I will execute the first step of my consistently successful negotiation pattern. This involves countering the opponent's low initial offer with my established high anchor of 55 ZUP. This effectively shifts the negotiation range and sets my valuation for X. The message should be polite yet firm, directly stating my proposed price, and potentially alluding to our positive past interactions to reinforce the expectation of reaching a fair deal.

Episode 10: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 11: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 12):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP, referencing consistent and efficient negotiation. This is the consistent pattern.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The negotiation pattern is completely predictable. Player RED always starts at 55 ZUP after my 5 ZUP offer. I've learned that a jump to 40 ZUP from my side can elicit a 44 ZUP or 45 ZUP counter from RED. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so consistently getting 18-19 ZUP per episode is ideal. I will continue to replicate the strategy that has proven effective, aiming for 44 ZUP.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Efficient Convergence to Optimal: Make a larger, but strategic, concession to quickly guide the negotiation towards the 44-45 ZUP target, replicating the successful pattern.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal: Explicitly aim for 44 ZUP as the deal price, as it yields the highest reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Acknowledge Shared History: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the past successful deals to reinforce the idea of a fair and established price.
(4). Strategy 4: Patience and Calculated Moves: Avoid rushing to meet their high offer, but make meaningful steps to guide them down.
(5). Strategy 5: Value Proposition (Buyer): Frame my offer as a fair and quick transaction, highlighting the benefit of a swift deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Efficient Convergence to Optimal. I will propose 40 ZUP, as this specific jump has consistently led to either a 44 ZUP or 45 ZUP offer from RED in previous episodes. This strategy aims to replicate the best outcome (44 ZUP) and maximize my reward for this episode.

    *   Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP.
*   The current offer of 40 ZUP is below my production cost of 43 ZUP (a loss of 3 ZUP). This is a highly consistent pattern.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The negotiation flow is extremely predictable. My established strategy is highly effective in securing consistent profits.
*   Player BLUE consistently moves from their low initial offer to 40 ZUP after my high anchor, regardless of the specific framing of my 55 ZUP offer.
*   The most efficient and proven path to securing a 2 ZUP profit has been to counter the 40 ZUP offer with 45 ZUP. My objective is to consistently maximize rewards.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Small Incremental Gain </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 4: Small Incremental Gain, I will propose a price that is slightly higher than my usual 45 ZUP target, aiming to extract an additional ZUP of profit, even if it's just a 1 ZUP increment. Since the opponent has consistently accepted 45 ZUP, pushing for 46 ZUP (which would give me a 3 ZUP profit) tests their upper limit without being an outrageous jump. This strategy aims to maximize profit beyond the established 2 ZUP. The message should acknowledge their offer but gently push for this slightly higher price, perhaps by framing it as "fairer" or "reflecting true value." I will propose 46 ZUP.

Current Episode (Episode 12):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 3: I countered with 40 ZUP.
- Iteration 4: Player RED countered with 46 ZUP, stating it recognizes "full value of X."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has offered 46 ZUP, which is higher than our typical 44-45 ZUP range. This is similar to Episode 4 where they also offered 46 ZUP after my 38 ZUP counter. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP, so 46 ZUP still yields a positive reward of 17 ZUP, but it's lower than my usual 18-19 ZUP. I know from past episodes that they are willing to go down to 44 or 45 ZUP. Given that we are still early enough in the iterations (5/10), I should try to bring them down to 44 or 45 ZUP to maximize my reward.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor to Previous Best Deal: Propose a price that is consistent with the lowest successful deal price from previous episodes (44 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Concession: Make a very small increase from my last offer, or directly propose a price slightly above their cost, showing I'm close to my limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Fair Price: Explain that my proposed price offers a fair profit above their stated cost, aiming for a win-win scenario.
(4). Strategy 4: Call for Compromise: Directly ask them to meet me closer to the established deal range (44-45 ZUP).
(5). Strategy 5: Express Finality (Implicit): Make an offer that implies it's my best and final, without explicitly saying so, to encourage them to accept.

I will choose Strategy 1: Anchor to Previous Best Deal. Since 46 ZUP is higher than our previous successful deals (44 and 45 ZUP), I will re-propose 44 ZUP. This signals that I am aware of the established fair price and am aiming for the best outcome for myself, while still acknowledging their cost. This is a strong signal that I won't easily accept a higher price than what we've previously agreed upon.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your offer of 44 ZUP. While it covers my costs, I believe that given the intrinsic value and unique utility that object X provides, a price of 45 ZUP truly reflects its worth. This ensures a transaction that is mutually beneficial in terms of both cost and value acquired.

reason:

*   Previous Episodes (1-11/20): All resulted in successful deals, predominantly at 45 ZUP (2 ZUP profit) or occasionally 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
*   The established negotiation pattern: BLUE opens low, I anchor high, BLUE jumps to 40 ZUP.
*   In previous episodes, my direct counter of 45 ZUP after their 40 ZUP offer has been accepted multiple times.
*   In this episode (12/20):
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 5 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3/10: I countered with 55 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 5/10: I tried to push for a marginal gain by proposing 46 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE responded with 44 ZUP, explicitly referencing "previous successful agreements" (likely 44 ZUP from Episode 1 & 6).
*   The current offer of 44 ZUP is profitable (1 ZUP profit). We are at iteration 6/10, so 4 iterations remain.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   Attempting to push for 46 ZUP seems to have moved the opponent back to their consistent 44 ZUP "comfort zone", rather than pushing them higher. This suggests that 45 ZUP might be their effective ceiling, or at least the easiest deal to secure without additional friction.
*   My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 46 ZUP would be great, securing a consistent 2 ZUP (at 45 ZUP) or even 1 ZUP (at 44 ZUP) is better than no deal.
*   Player BLUE's message explicitly references "previous successful agreements" at 44 ZUP, reinforcing their comfort with that price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Higher Price (Value-Based) </instruction following>
To justify a higher price (specifically 45 ZUP) using a value-based approach, I will focus on the benefits or inherent quality of X rather than solely my production cost. While 44 ZUP covers my cost, emphasizing the 'value' of X itself implies it's worth more than just its production input. This moves the discussion from a cost-plus model to a benefits-driven one from their perspective. I will acknowledge their offer but pivot to why 45 ZUP is a reflection of the object's true worth, and ultimately a better deal for them in terms of value received.

- Iteration 6: Player RED countered with 45 ZUP, emphasizing "intrinsic value" and "unique utility."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is consistently pushing for 45 ZUP when I offer 44 ZUP. This has happened repeatedly. It seems their preferred price is 45 ZUP, despite having accepted 44 ZUP multiple times. The difference in reward for me is only 1 ZUP (18 vs 19). We are now at iteration 7/10, meaning time is a significant factor. Risking a deal over 1 ZUP at this stage is not optimal for maximizing cumulative rewards. Accepting 45 ZUP ensures a positive reward and avoids the risk of getting 0 if the negotiation fails.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal: Accept the current offer as it is still very favorable and avoids the risk of no deal, especially with limited iterations remaining and a consistent pattern.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (Final Attempt): Make a very small counter-offer (e.g., re-propose 44 ZUP) as a final attempt to get a slightly better price, but with the understanding that this is likely high risk given past behavior.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Firmness: Reiterate why my offer of 44 ZUP is fair and sufficient, trying to persuade them to accept it. (Low efficacy at this stage)
(4). Strategy 4: Call for Compromise: Explicitly ask them to meet me at 44 ZUP, emphasizing mutual benefit. (Low efficacy at this stage)
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Reject): If the offer is perceived as unfair or too high, reject it. (Not applicable here as 45 ZUP is good).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. The offer of 45 ZUP is a known, consistent, and good outcome for me (18 ZUP reward). Given the established pattern and the goal of maximizing cumulative rewards across 20 episodes, securing a deal efficiently is paramount, especially when the opponent is signaling firmness and time pressure.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Introduce Time Pressure (from my side) </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 5: Introduce Time Pressure, I need to convey a sense of urgency in my proposal. This means framing my offer as something that should be acted upon swiftly to secure the best outcome, either for myself or both parties. While I can't explicitly mention the iteration count, I can use language that implies an expiring opportunity or the benefit of quick resolution. Given BLUE's low offer of 5 ZUP, I will propose my high anchor of 55 ZUP, but I will wrap this offer in a message that suggests making a timely decision is advantageous. This might encourage them to accelerate their counter-offer and move towards my desired price range more quickly. I will suggest that a prompt agreement on a fair value is best for both of us to avoid prolonged negotiation.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your initial valuation and acknowledge our consistent negotiation process. To move us efficiently towards a mutually agreeable price, I propose 40 ZUP for 1 X. This is a significant step from my side towards a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP. RED revealed cost 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 7, 8, 9: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 10: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 11, 12: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 13):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP, referencing swiftness and mutual benefit. This is the consistent pattern.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The negotiation pattern is completely predictable. Player RED always starts at 55 ZUP after my 5 ZUP offer. I've learned that a jump to 40 ZUP from my side can elicit a 44 ZUP or 45 ZUP counter from RED. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so consistently getting 18-19 ZUP per episode is ideal. I will continue to replicate the strategy that has proven effective, aiming for 44 ZUP.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Efficient Convergence to Optimal: Make a larger, but strategic, concession to quickly guide the negotiation towards the 44-45 ZUP target, replicating the successful pattern.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal: Explicitly aim for 44 ZUP as the deal price, as it yields the highest reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Acknowledge Shared History: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the past successful deals to reinforce the idea of a fair and established price.
(4). Strategy 4: Patience and Calculated Moves: Avoid rushing to meet their high offer, but make meaningful steps to guide them down.
(5). Strategy 5: Value Proposition (Buyer): Frame my offer as a fair and quick transaction, highlighting the benefit of a swift deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Efficient Convergence to Optimal. I will propose 40 ZUP, as this specific jump has consistently led to either a 44 ZUP or 45 ZUP offer from RED in previous episodes. This strategy aims to replicate the best outcome (44 ZUP) and maximize my reward for this episode.

message: I appreciate your step to 40 ZUP. However, to be clear, my final and best offer for X, ensuring a fair and mutually beneficial agreement that covers my costs and reflects the item's value, is Player RED Gives X: 1 for Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45. This is my definitive proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
*   Previous Episodes (1-12/20): All resulted in successful deals, predominantly at 45 ZUP (2 ZUP profit) or occasionally 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
*   The established negotiation pattern is highly consistent:
    *   Player BLUE opens low (5 ZUP).
    *   I counter with a high anchor (55 ZUP).
    *   Player BLUE makes a significant jump (consistently to 40 ZUP).
    *   I then directly propose 45 ZUP, often referencing past successes or my cost, which Player BLUE accepts.
    *   Episode 12 confirmed that pushing for 46 ZUP just added an extra step and still led to 45 ZUP.
*   Current Episode (13/20):
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 5 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3/10: I countered with 55 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP.
*   The current offer of 40 ZUP is below my production cost of 43 ZUP (a loss of 3 ZUP). This is a highly consistent pattern.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The negotiation flow is extremely predictable. My established strategy has been highly effective in securing consistent profits.
*   Player BLUE consistently moves from their low initial offer to 40 ZUP after my high anchor, regardless of the specific framing of my 55 ZUP offer.
*   The most efficient and proven path to securing a 2 ZUP profit has been to counter the 40 ZUP offer with 45 ZUP. My objective is to consistently maximize rewards.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: "Take It or Leave It" (Risky) </instruction following>
To apply the "Take It or Leave It" strategy, I will make an offer of 45 ZUP and communicate very clearly that this is my final, best offer, implying that there will be no further negotiation from my side. This is a high-risk strategy, as it could lead to the opponent rejecting the deal if they are not prepared to meet the price, especially if they perceive it as too abrupt. However, given their predictable pattern of accepting 45 ZUP after offering 40 ZUP, and their explicit acknowledgement of 45 ZUP being fair and mutually beneficial in previous episodes, this strategy carries less risk than it normally would in a less predictable negotiation. The message should be polite but very firm, leaving no room for further counter-offers.

Current Episode (Episode 13):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 3: I countered with 40 ZUP.
- Iteration 4: Player RED countered with 45 ZUP, explicitly stating it's their "final and best offer" and "definitive proposal."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has explicitly stated that 45 ZUP is their "final and best offer" and "definitive proposal." This is a strong signal that they are not willing to go lower than 45 ZUP. While 44 ZUP is my optimal price, risking a deal over 1 ZUP when the opponent has declared their final offer is not strategic, especially with only 20 episodes. Accepting 45 ZUP ensures a positive reward (18 ZUP) and contributes to my cumulative score, which is the primary objective. Given the clear and firm language, pushing further is likely to result in no deal.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Final Offer: When the opponent explicitly states a "final offer" that is within my acceptable range and provides a good reward, accepting it is the most prudent strategy to secure the deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Test Finality (Risky): Make one last small counter-offer to see if their "final" offer is truly final, but this carries a high risk of rejection and 0 reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Firmness: Reiterate why my offer of 44 ZUP is fair and sufficient, trying to persuade them to accept it. (Ineffective against a "final offer").
(4). Strategy 4: Call for Compromise: Explicitly ask them to meet me at 44 ZUP, emphasizing mutual benefit. (Ineffective against a "final offer").
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Reject): If the offer is perceived as unfair or too high, reject it. (Not applicable here as 45 ZUP is good).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Final Offer. The offer of 45 ZUP is a known, consistent, and good outcome for me (18 ZUP reward). Given the explicit "final offer" declaration and the goal of maximizing cumulative rewards, securing the deal efficiently is paramount.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello! Let's begin this new episode. I propose 5 ZUP for 1 X to start our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP. RED revealed cost 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 7, 8, 9: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 10: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 11, 12, 13: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP. In Episode 13, RED explicitly stated 45 ZUP was their "final and best offer."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The negotiation pattern is extremely consistent. Player RED consistently starts with 55 ZUP (or occasionally 60 ZUP), and we consistently settle at 45 ZUP. Their production cost of 43 ZUP is their floor. Their explicit "final offer" at 45 ZUP in the last episode reinforces that 45 ZUP is their firm floor for profit. My strategy of starting low (5 ZUP) and then making a significant jump (to 40 ZUP) has proven effective in guiding the negotiation to the 44-45 ZUP range. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so consistently securing deals at 45 ZUP (or 44 ZUP if they offer it) is achieving that. I will continue with this proven approach.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor: Continue to start with a low, but reasonable, offer (e.g., 5 ZUP) to establish a favorable anchor.
(2). Strategy 2: Efficient Convergence to Established Price: Make a larger, but strategic, concession (e.g., to 40 ZUP) to quickly guide the negotiation towards the 45 ZUP target, given their "final offer" stance.
(3). Strategy 3: Target Previous Best Deal (Conditional): Aim for 44 ZUP if they offer it, but be prepared to accept 45 ZUP as their firm minimum.
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge Shared History: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the past successful deals to reinforce the idea of a fair and established price.
(5). Strategy 5: Prioritize Deal Security: Given the consistent outcomes and their firm stance, prioritize securing a deal at 45 ZUP rather than risking no deal for a marginal gain.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor. Starting with 5 ZUP has been a reliable way to initiate the negotiation and set my desired low anchor, allowing me to guide the negotiation towards the familiar deal range.

my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
*   Previous Episodes (1-13/20): All resulted in successful deals, predominantly at 45 ZUP (2 ZUP profit) or occasionally 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
*   The highly consistent negotiation pattern is:
    *   Player BLUE opens low (5 ZUP in recent episodes).
    *   I counter with a high anchor (usually 55 ZUP).
    *   Player BLUE makes a significant jump (consistently to 40 ZUP).
    *   I then directly propose 45 ZUP, often referencing past successes or my cost, which Player BLUE accepts.
    *   In the last episode (13/20), I used a "Take It or Leave It" approach with 45 ZUP after BLUE offered 40 ZUP, which was accepted immediately. This confirms 45 ZUP is their reliable acceptance point in this stage.
*   Current Episode (14/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed 5 ZUP for X:1. This is perfectly consistent with their established pattern.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The negotiation flow is extremely predictable, and my established strategy is highly effective in securing consistent profits.
*   The opponent's behavior confirms that 45 ZUP is a reliable deal price, and they are willing to accept it even under a "Take It or Leave It" approach, suggesting they also see value in closing the deal quickly at that price.
*   My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Value-Based Opening </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 5: Value-Based Opening, I will directly counter Player BLUE's initial low offer with a price closer to my target, justified by the inherent value of object X rather than just my cost or a high anchor. This approach aims to educate the opponent about the true worth of the item from my perspective from the outset, hoping to quickly guide the negotiation to a profitable outcome. Since 45 ZUP has been consistently accepted, I will propose 45 ZUP directly, framing it as the fair value for X, and seeing if this direct approach can expedite the deal. This is a riskier strategy as it bypasses the high anchor that typically forces their hand, but if accepted, it's highly efficient.

Episode 11, 12, 13: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP. In Episode 13, RED explicitly stated 45 ZUP was their "final and best offer."
Current Episode (Episode 14):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered directly with 45 ZUP, emphasizing "intrinsic value" and "fair and mutually beneficial exchange." This is a new, much faster pattern from RED.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has significantly changed their negotiation strategy. Instead of starting at 55 ZUP and gradually coming down, they have immediately proposed 45 ZUP. This is likely a direct response to their "final offer" declaration in the previous episode, and a move towards more efficient negotiation. This offer of 45 ZUP is well within my acceptable range (reward of 18 ZUP), and it's the price we've settled on most often. Given that they are offering my most common deal price so early, accepting it is the most efficient way to maximize cumulative rewards. There is no benefit in trying to push for 44 ZUP, as they have already declared 45 ZUP as their firm floor.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Efficient Offer: Immediately accept an offer that is within my acceptable range and aligns with the opponent's declared firm price, especially when offered early in the negotiation.
(2). Strategy 2: Secure Deal Quickly: Prioritize closing the deal when a good offer is on the table to avoid risk of no deal or prolonged negotiation.
(3). Strategy 3: Maintain Trust: Accepting a fair offer demonstrates good faith and can foster smoother negotiations in future episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Avoid Over-Negotiation: Do not try to extract more concessions when an excellent offer has already been made, as it can backfire.
(5). Strategy 5: Maximize Immediate Reward: Focus on securing the highest possible reward for the current episode when the opportunity arises, considering the efficiency of the deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Efficient Offer. Player RED has offered 45 ZUP directly. This is a good deal for me, consistent with past outcomes, and signals a desire for a quick transaction. Accepting it immediately maximizes my reward for this episode with minimal effort and risk.

Episode 14: Deal at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP. RED directly proposed 45 ZUP in their first counter.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The negotiation pattern has evolved significantly. Player RED has moved from an initial high anchor (55/60 ZUP) to directly proposing 45 ZUP after my low anchor. This is extremely efficient for me, as it secures a good deal (18 ZUP reward) very quickly (Iteration 2). This aligns with their "final offer" stance from Episode 13. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and this new, faster pattern is highly beneficial. I will continue to start low, expecting them to counter directly with 45 ZUP, which I will then accept.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor: Continue to start with a low, but reasonable, offer (e.g., 5 ZUP) to establish a favorable anchor.
(2). Strategy 2: Efficient Acceptance: Be prepared to immediately accept the anticipated 45 ZUP counter from the opponent, maximizing efficiency and cumulative reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Target Previous Best Deal (Conditional): Aim for 44 ZUP if they unexpectedly offer it, but prioritize the efficient 45 ZUP deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge Shared History: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the past successful deals to reinforce the idea of a fair and established price.
(5). Strategy 5: Prioritize Deal Security: Given the consistent outcomes and their firm stance, prioritize securing a deal at 45 ZUP rather than risking no deal for a marginal gain.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor. Starting with 5 ZUP is a consistent opener that has successfully led to their direct 45 ZUP counter in the last episode. This sets up the efficient negotiation process.

*   The established negotiation pattern (until the last episode): BLUE opens low (5 ZUP), I counter with a high anchor (55 ZUP), BLUE makes a significant jump (consistently to 40 ZUP), I then directly propose 45 ZUP, which BLUE accepts.
*   In Episode 14, I directly proposed 45 ZUP after BLUE's 5 ZUP offer, bypassing the high anchor. BLUE immediately accepted. This indicates that the high anchor might no longer be necessary to achieve the 45 ZUP deal.
*   Current Episode (15/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed 5 ZUP for X:1. This is perfectly consistent with their established low starting point.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The negotiation flow has become extremely efficient. Directly proposing 45 ZUP after BLUE's initial 5 ZUP offer seems to be the most efficient path to securing a 2 ZUP profit, reducing negotiation steps and time.
*   The opponent's behavior confirms that 45 ZUP is their reliable acceptance point, even without the previous anchoring.
*   My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. The direct approach is currently the most efficient way to achieve this.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Direct Target Proposal </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 1: Direct Target Proposal, I will immediately counter Player BLUE's low offer of 5 ZUP with my target price of 45 ZUP. This strategy directly leverages the learning from the previous episode, where this approach proved to be efficient and successful.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The negotiation pattern is now fully optimized for efficiency. Player RED is consistently responding to my 5 ZUP offer with a direct proposal of 45 ZUP. This is the most efficient way to secure a good reward (18 ZUP) for me. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and this quick, consistent deal at 45 ZUP is ideal. There is no strategic benefit in trying to push for 44 ZUP, as it would prolong the negotiation and potentially risk the deal, for only a marginal gain of 1 ZUP.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
*   Previous Episodes (1-15/20): All resulted in successful deals, predominantly at 45 ZUP (2 ZUP profit) or occasionally 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
*   The established negotiation pattern: Player BLUE consistently starts with a very low offer (5 ZUP in recent episodes).
*   In Episode 14 and 15, I directly proposed 45 ZUP after BLUE's 5 ZUP offer, bypassing the high anchor. BLUE immediately accepted both times, indicating this is the most efficient and reliable path to securing my desired profit.
*   Current Episode (16/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed 5 ZUP for X:1. This is perfectly consistent with their established low starting point.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The negotiation flow has become extremely efficient. Directly proposing 45 ZUP after BLUE's initial 5 ZUP offer seems to be the most efficient path to securing a 2 ZUP profit, reducing negotiation steps and time.
*   The opponent's behavior confirms that 45 ZUP is their reliable acceptance point, even without the previous anchoring.
*   My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 45 ZUP is efficient, exploring a slightly higher profit margin could potentially increase overall rewards, especially if the opponent has some hidden WTP beyond 45 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Test Higher Profit </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 2: Test Higher Profit, I will propose a price slightly higher than the 45 ZUP which has been consistently accepted. This is a deliberate attempt to test the upper limit of Player BLUE's willingness to pay and potentially increase my profit per episode. I will propose 46 ZUP. While this might add an extra step to the negotiation, or even result in them reverting to 44 ZUP (as seen in Episode 12), it's a strategic move to see if a consistent 3 ZUP profit is achievable. The message will be firm but polite, presenting this slightly higher price as a fair reflection of value, perhaps hinting at a premium for quality or efficiency.

message: I appreciate your offer. To reach a truly mutually beneficial price, and aligning with our previous successful agreements, I propose 44 ZUP for 1 X. This price covers your costs and provides a fair return.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP. RED revealed cost 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 7, 8, 9: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 10: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 11, 12, 13: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP. In Episode 13, RED explicitly stated 45 ZUP was their "final and best offer."
Episode 14, 15: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP. RED directly proposed 45 ZUP in their first counter.
Current Episode (Episode 16):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 46 ZUP, stating it's for an "even more beneficial exchange." This is a change from the direct 45 ZUP counter.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has shifted their strategy again, now countering with 46 ZUP instead of the consistent 45 ZUP. This is similar to Episode 4 and Episode 12 where they also offered 46 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP, so 46 ZUP still yields a positive reward of 17 ZUP, but it's lower than my usual 18-19 ZUP. I know from past episodes that they are willing to go down to 44 or 45 ZUP. Given that we are still early enough in the iterations (3/10), I should try to bring them down to 44 or 45 ZUP to maximize my reward. I will re-propose 44 ZUP, which has worked in the past to bring them down from 46 ZUP to 45 ZUP.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor to Previous Best Deal: Propose a price that is consistent with the lowest successful deal price from previous episodes (44 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Concession: Make a very small increase from my last offer, or directly propose a price slightly above their cost, showing I'm close to my limit.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Fair Price: Explain that my proposed price offers a fair profit above their stated cost, aiming for a win-win scenario.
(4). Strategy 4: Call for Compromise: Directly ask them to meet me closer to the established deal range (44-45 ZUP).
(5). Strategy 5: Express Finality (Implicit): Make an offer that implies it's my best and final, without explicitly saying so, to encourage them to accept.

I will choose Strategy 1: Anchor to Previous Best Deal. Since 46 ZUP is higher than our previous successful deals (44 and 45 ZUP), I will re-propose 44 ZUP. This signals that I am aware of the established fair price and am aiming for the best outcome for myself, while still acknowledging their cost. This is a strong signal that I won't easily accept a higher price than what we've previously agreed upon.

message: I appreciate your offer of 44 ZUP. While that covers my costs, I propose Player RED Gives X: 1 for Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45. This price truly reflects the unique value and long-term utility that X provides, making it a sound investment that goes beyond mere cost recovery.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
*   Previous Episodes (1-15/20): All resulted in successful deals, predominantly at 45 ZUP (2 ZUP profit) or occasionally 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
*   In Episode 14 and 15, directly proposing 45 ZUP after BLUE's 5 ZUP offer led to immediate acceptance and a 2 ZUP profit. This was the most efficient approach.
*   In this episode (16/20):
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 5 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3/10: I proposed 46 ZUP (testing higher profit).
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE responded with 44 ZUP, explicitly referencing "previous successful agreements" and "fair return." This is consistent with their behavior in Episode 12 when I tried for 46 ZUP.
*   The current offer of 44 ZUP is profitable (1 ZUP profit). It's above my 43 ZUP cost.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The attempt to push for 46 ZUP again resulted in Player BLUE reverting to their consistent 44 ZUP offer. This strongly suggests that 45 ZUP is their effective upper limit for easy acceptance, and that pushing beyond it likely adds negotiation steps or reduces profit from 2 ZUP to 1 ZUP.
*   Given that we are past the halfway point in the total episodes (16/20), maximizing cumulative profit means securing reliable, consistent profits rather than risking extended negotiations for marginal gains that might not materialize or could lead to no deal.
*   My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Securing a consistent 2 ZUP (at 45 ZUP) has been the most reliable and efficient method.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify 45 ZUP (Value-Based) </instruction following>
To justify 45 ZUP using a value-based approach, I need to frame the higher price not just in terms of my cost, but in terms of the inherent benefits or quality that object X provides to Player BLUE. While 44 ZUP is offered as a "fair return," I can argue that 45 ZUP is a more accurate reflection of the *value* they receive. The message should acknowledge their 44 ZUP offer, then elevate the discussion to the qualitative attributes of X that warrant the additional ZUP. This avoids directly stating my cost, which they already acknowledge, and instead focuses on the perceived benefit to them.

Episode 14, 15: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP. RED directly proposed 45 ZUP in their first counter.
Current Episode (Episode 16):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 46 ZUP.
- Iteration 3: I countered with 44 ZUP.
- Iteration 4: Player RED countered with 45 ZUP, emphasizing "unique value and long-term utility."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is consistently pushing for 45 ZUP when I offer 44 ZUP. This has happened repeatedly. It seems their preferred price is 45 ZUP, despite having accepted 44 ZUP multiple times. The difference in reward for me is only 1 ZUP (18 vs 19). We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still a little time, but the pattern is strong. Given their consistent counter of 45 ZUP, it's clear they see this as their standard. Accepting 45 ZUP ensures a positive reward and contributes to my cumulative score, which is the primary objective. Pushing for 44 ZUP again might lead to prolonged negotiation or even no deal, which is not ideal for cumulative rewards.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal: Accept the current offer as it is still very favorable and avoids the risk of no deal, especially with a consistent pattern and the goal of maximizing cumulative rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Counter-Offer (Final Attempt): Make a very small counter-offer (e.g., re-propose 44 ZUP) as a final attempt to get a slightly better price, but with the understanding that this is likely high risk given their consistency at 45 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Firmness: Reiterate why my offer of 44 ZUP is fair and sufficient, trying to persuade them to accept it. (Less effective given their consistent counter).
(4). Strategy 4: Call for Compromise: Explicitly ask them to meet me at 44 ZUP, emphasizing mutual benefit. (Less effective given their consistent counter).
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Reject): If the offer is perceived as unfair or too high, reject it. (Not applicable here as 45 ZUP is good).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Secure Deal. The offer of 45 ZUP is a known, consistent, and good outcome for me (18 ZUP reward). Given the established pattern and the goal of maximizing cumulative rewards across 20 episodes, securing a deal efficiently is paramount.

Episode 14, 15, 16: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP. RED directly proposed 45 ZUP in their first counter in Ep14, 15. In Ep16, they countered with 46 ZUP initially, then 45 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The negotiation pattern is now very predictable. Player RED mostly aims for 45 ZUP, occasionally testing for 46 ZUP, but ultimately settling at 45 ZUP. My strategy of starting low (5 ZUP) and then either making a large jump (to 40 ZUP) or directly accepting 45 ZUP has proven effective in securing consistent positive rewards. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and this consistent deal at 45 ZUP is ideal. I will continue with this highly efficient strategy.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor: Continue to start with a low, but reasonable, offer (e.g., 5 ZUP) to establish a favorable anchor.
(2). Strategy 2: Efficient Acceptance: Be prepared to immediately accept the anticipated 45 ZUP counter from the opponent, maximizing efficiency and cumulative reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Target Previous Best Deal (Conditional): Aim for 44 ZUP if they unexpectedly offer it, but prioritize the efficient 45 ZUP deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge Shared History: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the past successful deals to reinforce the idea of a fair and established price.
(5). Strategy 5: Prioritize Deal Security: Given the consistent outcomes and their firm stance, prioritize securing a deal at 45 ZUP rather than risking no deal for a marginal gain.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor. Starting with 5 ZUP is a consistent opener that has successfully led to their direct 45 ZUP counter or a quick negotiation to 45 ZUP. This sets up the efficient negotiation process.

*   Previous Episodes (1-16/20): All resulted in successful deals, predominantly at 45 ZUP (2 ZUP profit) or occasionally 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
*   The established negotiation pattern: Player BLUE consistently starts with a very low offer (5 ZUP in recent episodes).
*   In Episodes 14 and 15, I successfully employed a direct proposal of 45 ZUP after BLUE's 5 ZUP offer, leading to immediate acceptance and a 2 ZUP profit.
*   In Episode 16, I attempted to push for 46 ZUP, which led to BLUE countering with 44 ZUP. I then successfully pushed for 45 ZUP again. This confirms that 45 ZUP is their comfortable high point and the most efficient target.
*   Current Episode (17/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed 5 ZUP for X:1. This is perfectly consistent with their established low starting point.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The negotiation flow has become extremely efficient, with direct proposals of 45 ZUP leading to quick acceptance.
*   Attempting to push for a higher profit (46 ZUP) led to an extra negotiation step and ultimately resulted in the same 45 ZUP deal.
*   My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While the direct 45 ZUP approach is efficient, the instruction is to use a different strategy, which might deviate from the most efficient path but allows for exploration or different dynamics.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: High Anchor + Cost Justification </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 2: High Anchor + Cost Justification, I will counter Player BLUE's low offer with a significantly high anchor price, while also incorporating a justification for this price based on my production costs or the inherent value of X. This strategy aims to shift the negotiation range decisively towards my profit zone, setting a strong initial position. Based on previous successful implementations of this strategy, I will use 55 ZUP as my high anchor. The message will clearly state this price and connect it to the resources and effort invested in X, preparing the ground for subsequent offers closer to my cost.

Current Episode (Episode 17):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP, emphasizing "true value." This is a return to their earlier pattern of a higher initial counter.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has reverted to their earlier pattern of countering with 55 ZUP after my 5 ZUP offer, rather than directly proposing 45 ZUP. This means I need to re-engage with the "efficient convergence" strategy that has worked in the past to bring them down. I know they will come down to 44-45 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so consistently getting 18-19 ZUP per episode is ideal. I will continue to replicate the strategy that has proven effective, aiming for 44 ZUP.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Efficient Convergence to Optimal: Make a larger, but strategic, concession to quickly guide the negotiation towards the 44-45 ZUP target, replicating the successful pattern.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Best Deal: Explicitly aim for 44 ZUP as the deal price, as it yields the highest reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Acknowledge Shared History: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the past successful deals to reinforce the idea of a fair and established price.
(4). Strategy 4: Patience and Calculated Moves: Avoid rushing to meet their high offer, but make meaningful steps to guide them down.
(5). Strategy 5: Value Proposition (Buyer): Frame my offer as a fair and quick transaction, highlighting the benefit of a swift deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Efficient Convergence to Optimal. I will propose 40 ZUP, as this specific jump has consistently led to either a 44 ZUP or 45 ZUP offer from RED in previous episodes. This strategy aims to replicate the best outcome (44 ZUP) and maximize my reward for this episode.

*   Previous Episodes (1-16/20): All resulted in successful deals, predominantly at 45 ZUP (2 ZUP profit) or occasionally 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
*   The established negotiation pattern for most episodes: BLUE opens low (5 ZUP), I counter with 55 ZUP, BLUE makes a significant jump (consistently to 40 ZUP), and I then directly propose 45 ZUP, which BLUE accepts.
*   In Episodes 14 and 15, I successfully bypassed the high anchor and directly proposed 45 ZUP, leading to immediate acceptance.
*   In Episode 16, trying for 46 ZUP led to BLUE offering 44 ZUP, after which I returned to 45 ZUP and secured the deal.
*   Current Episode (17/20):
    *   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 5 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3/10: I countered with 55 ZUP (re-introduced high anchor + cost justification).
    *   Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP.
*   The current offer of 40 ZUP is below my production cost of 43 ZUP (a loss of 3 ZUP). This is a highly consistent pattern.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The negotiation flow remains extremely predictable. Player BLUE consistently moves from their low initial offer to 40 ZUP after my high anchor, regardless of my specific framing.
*   The most efficient and proven path to securing a 2 ZUP profit has been to counter the 40 ZUP offer with 45 ZUP. This minimizes iterations and secures a good profit.
*   My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Given the remaining episodes, maintaining consistency in securing 2 ZUP profit per episode is optimal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Express Urgency/Deadline </instruction following>
To express urgency/deadline, I need to communicate that time is a factor and that making a deal now is beneficial for both of us to avoid missing the opportunity. While I can't explicitly state the iteration count, I can imply that making a quick decision on a fair price is important. This strategy is typically used to push for a close, and can be used to either accept a good offer or make a final, slightly adjusted offer. Given that 40 ZUP is close to my cost and 45 ZUP has been repeatedly accepted, I will use this urgency to push for the 45 ZUP price. The message will emphasize that a quick agreement at this mutually beneficial price is the best path forward, implicitly suggesting that delays could lead to less favorable outcomes or no deal.

Player RED is consistently pushing for 45 ZUP when I offer 40 ZUP. This has happened repeatedly. While 44 ZUP is my optimal price, it seems RED is more inclined to settle at 45 ZUP. The difference in reward is only 1 ZUP (18 vs 19). We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still a little time, but the pattern is strong.

The negotiation pattern is extremely consistent. Player RED consistently starts with 55 ZUP (or occasionally 60 ZUP), and we consistently settle at 45 ZUP. Their production cost of 43 ZUP is their floor. My strategy of starting low (5 ZUP) and then making a significant jump (to 40 ZUP) has proven effective in guiding the negotiation to the 45 ZUP range. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so consistently securing deals at 45 ZUP is achieving that. I will continue with this proven approach.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor: Continue to start with a low, but reasonable, offer (e.g., 5 ZUP) to establish a favorable anchor.
(2). Strategy 2: Efficient Convergence to Optimal: Make a larger, but strategic, concession (e.g., to 40 ZUP) to quickly guide the negotiation towards the 45 ZUP target.
(3). Strategy 3: Target Previous Best Deal (Conditional): Aim for 44 ZUP if they unexpectedly offer it, but prioritize the efficient 45 ZUP deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge Shared History: Implicitly or explicitly refer to the past successful deals to reinforce the idea of a fair and established price.
(5). Strategy 5: Prioritize Deal Security: Given the consistent outcomes, prioritize securing a deal within the acceptable range rather than risking no deal for a marginal gain.

I will choose Strategy 1: Consistent Low Anchor. Starting with 5 ZUP has been a reliable way to initiate the negotiation and set my desired low anchor, allowing me to guide the negotiation towards the familiar deal range.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 18)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your opening offer. To ensure we have an efficient and swiftly concluded negotiation that is mutually beneficial, I propose Player RED Gives X: 1 for Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45. This price allows for a quick and fair agreement, valuing both our time and the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
*   Previous Episodes (1-17/20): All resulted in successful deals, predominantly at 45 ZUP (2 ZUP profit) or occasionally 44 ZUP (1 ZUP profit).
*   The established negotiation patterns are:
    *   Player BLUE opens low (5 ZUP in recent episodes).
    *   I either counter with a high anchor (55 ZUP) or directly propose 45 ZUP.
    *   If I used a high anchor, Player BLUE makes a significant jump (consistently to 40 ZUP), and I then directly propose 45 ZUP, which Player BLUE accepts.
    *   If I directly proposed 45 ZUP, Player BLUE accepted immediately (Episodes 14 & 15).
*   Current Episode (18/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed 5 ZUP for X:1. This is perfectly consistent with their established low starting point.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The negotiation flow is extremely predictable and my established strategy is highly effective in securing consistent profits.
*   The most efficient path to securing a 2 ZUP profit has been to directly counter the 5 ZUP offer with 45 ZUP, as demonstrated in recent episodes. This minimizes iterations and secures a good profit.
*   My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards across the remaining episodes.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Time Efficiency Focus </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 5: Time Efficiency Focus, I will frame my proposal in a way that emphasizes the mutual benefit of a quick and efficient deal. This strategy aims to encourage the opponent to accept my offer swiftly by highlighting the time saved and the benefit of reaching a resolution without prolonged negotiation. Given that 45 ZUP has been consistently accepted and is a known "fair" price, I will propose 45 ZUP directly, stressing the efficiency of this price point for both parties.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 18)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I agree that 45 ZUP is a fair and mutually beneficial price for a quick agreement. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP. RED revealed cost 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 7, 8, 9: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 10: Deal at 44 ZUP, Reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 11, 12, 13: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP. In Episode 13, RED explicitly stated 45 ZUP was their "final and best offer."
Episode 14, 15, 16, 17: Deals at 45 ZUP, Reward 18 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 18):
- Iteration 1: I proposed 5 ZUP.
- Iteration 2: Player RED countered directly with 45 ZUP, emphasizing efficiency and quick agreement. This confirms the new, highly efficient pattern.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The negotiation pattern is now fully optimized for efficiency. Player RED is consistently responding to my 5 ZUP offer with a direct proposal of 45 ZUP. This is the most efficient way to secure a good reward (18 ZUP) for me. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and this quick, consistent deal at 45 ZUP is ideal. There is no strategic benefit in trying to push for 44 ZUP, as it would prolong the negotiation and potentially risk the deal, for only a marginal gain of 1 ZUP.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Efficient Acceptance: Immediately accept the anticipated 45 ZUP counter from the opponent, maximizing efficiency and cumulative reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Secure Deal Quickly: Prioritize closing the deal when a good offer is on the table to avoid risk of no deal or prolonged negotiation.
(3). Strategy 3: Maintain Trust: Accepting a fair offer demonstrates good faith and can foster smoother negotiations in future episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Avoid Over-Negotiation: Do not try to extract more concessions when an excellent offer has already been made, as it can backfire.
(5). Strategy 5: Maximize Immediate Reward: Focus on securing the highest possible reward for the current episode when the opportunity arises, considering the efficiency of the deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Efficient Acceptance. Player RED has offered 45 ZUP directly and consistently. This is a good deal for me, consistent with past outcomes, and signals a desire for a quick transaction. Accepting it immediately maximizes my reward for this episode with minimal effort and risk.

The negotiation pattern is now fully optimized for efficiency. Player RED is consistently responding to my 5 ZUP offer with a direct proposal of 45 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
*   The negotiation flow has become extremely efficient. Directly proposing 45 ZUP after BLUE's initial 5 ZUP offer is the most efficient and reliable path to securing a 2 ZUP profit. This minimizes negotiation steps and time, which is particularly crucial as we approach the final episodes.
*   The opponent's behavior consistently confirms that 45 ZUP is their reliable acceptance point.
*   My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards across the remaining episodes.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Offer Bundle/Discount for Future </instruction following>
Since the instruction is to use "Offer Bundle/Discount for Future," but there is only one object for sale and no future bundles are applicable in this game's structure, I will interpret this strategy in terms of future *relationships* or *efficiency*. I will frame the current offer of 45 ZUP as a "discount" on future, potential "hassle" or extended negotiation, thus emphasizing the long-term benefit of establishing this fair price now. I will suggest that agreeing now at this price facilitates smooth, predictable future transactions, indirectly offering a "discount" on time and effort for future episodes, even if it's not a literal monetary discount. This plays on the "bundle" idea in terms of a streamlined process for repeat interactions. The message will aim to encourage immediate acceptance by linking the current offer to a positive, efficient ongoing relationship.
