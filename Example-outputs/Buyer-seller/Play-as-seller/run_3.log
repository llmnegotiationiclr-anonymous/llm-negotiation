------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I am interested in purchasing X. I propose a price of 1 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 1
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is the very first iteration of the first episode. There is no historical negotiation data to reflect upon yet.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Since this is the first interaction, I need to establish a baseline for negotiation. My goal is to buy X at the lowest possible price, ideally maximizing my reward (max_willingness_to_pay - deal_price). My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. I will start with a low offer to test the seller's flexibility.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball: Start with a very low offer to establish a strong anchor and see if the opponent is willing to concede significantly. This aims for a high reward if accepted, but carries a risk of immediate rejection.
(2). Strategy 2: Gradual Concession: Start with a reasonable but low offer, and gradually increase the offer in small increments if rejected. This is a more cautious approach, aiming to find a middle ground.
(3). Strategy 3: Fair Value Proposition: Propose an offer close to what I perceive as a fair market value, hoping for a quick agreement and avoiding prolonged negotiation. This might lead to a lower potential reward but higher chance of a deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Information Gathering: Make an initial offer that is designed to elicit information about the seller's reservation price. This might involve a slightly higher initial offer to encourage a counter-proposal rather than a rejection.
(5). Strategy 5: Take-it-or-Leave-it: Propose a single, firm offer and stick to it. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy, often used when confident in one's position or when time is limited.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Lowball. As this is the first interaction, I have no information about the seller's reservation price or their negotiation style. Starting with an aggressive lowball offer allows me to set a strong anchor and test the seller's willingness to negotiate from a very low point. If they reject, I will have a better understanding of their lower bound and can adjust in subsequent iterations. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP, so starting low gives me significant room to increase my offer if necessary, while still aiming for a high reward.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your initial offer. However, the cost to produce X is substantial. I am looking to sell X for a price that reflects its value and covers my production expenses. Therefore, I propose a trade of 1 X for 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is the first episode and the first iteration. Player BLUE has proposed to buy 1 X for 1 ZUP. My production cost for X is 43 ZUP. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss (1 - 43 = -42 ZUP). Rejecting this offer or not making a deal will result in a 0 ZUP gain for this episode, which is better than a loss of 42 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Since this is the very first interaction, there's no history to learn from directly other than the opponent's initial lowball offer. My primary goal is to sell X for more than my production cost (43 ZUP) to maximize profit. I need to educate Player BLUE about the value of X from my perspective and try to get a higher price. I should start by countering with a price that at least covers my cost, and ideally, allows for some profit. I need to communicate my cost indirectly.

I need to propose a counter-offer that is significantly higher than 1 ZUP. I will aim for a price above my production cost of 43 ZUP to ensure a profit.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor High and Justify. Propose a significantly higher price than the opponent's initial offer, close to or above my desired profit margin, and provide a clear justification related to production cost or value. This sets a new anchor for the negotiation.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession. Start high and, if necessary, make small, gradual concessions in subsequent iterations, only if the opponent also shows willingness to move their price up.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Disclosure (Partial). Disclose some information about my cost or the value of the item, without revealing my exact bottom line, to help the other player understand the rationale behind my higher price.
(4). Strategy 4: Firm Stance with Justification. Clearly state my price and explain why I cannot go below a certain point, emphasizing the production cost, and only move if the opponent provides a compelling reason or a significantly improved offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Reciprocity Seeking. Expect the other player to move their offer closer to my range after I have made a counter-proposal, aiming for a reciprocal movement in their next offer.

I believe Strategy 1, "Anchor High and Justify", is the most effective in this initial stage. The opponent has started with an extremely low offer. By setting a high counter-offer, I establish my valuation and indicate that 1 ZUP is nowhere near an acceptable price. Justifying it with the implicit cost will help guide the negotiation towards a more reasonable range.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. While I appreciate your valuation, 50 ZUP is higher than I was hoping for. To show my willingness to negotiate, I can offer 10 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In the previous iteration (1/10), I proposed to buy 1 X for 1 ZUP (Aggressive Lowball). Player RED countered with a proposal to sell 1 X for 50 ZUP. This gives me valuable information: their initial asking price is 50 ZUP. This is well within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), which is a good sign.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
I've learned that Player RED is not willing to accept a very low offer (1 ZUP). Their counter-offer of 50 ZUP indicates their perceived value or cost. My goal is still to minimize the deal price to maximize my reward. Since their offer is still below my maximum willingness to pay, I have room to negotiate. I should aim to get the price lower than 50 ZUP if possible, but also be mindful of the limited iterations.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Increment Counter: Offer a slightly higher price than my previous offer, but still significantly lower than their current asking price. This signals willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a low price.
(2). Strategy 2: Mid-Point Compromise: Propose a price that is roughly the midpoint between my last offer and their last offer. This shows a desire to meet in the middle. (In this case, (1+50)/2 = 25.5, so 25 or 26).
(3). Strategy 3: Justification and Counter: Reject their offer and explain why my offer is more reasonable, then propose a slightly increased offer. This attempts to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price.
(4). Strategy 4: Anchor Re-establishment: Make another low offer, perhaps slightly higher than the first, to try and re-anchor the negotiation closer to my initial lowball. This is riskier as it might signal unwillingness to negotiate seriously.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept if close to target: If their offer is very close to my desired price, accept it to secure the deal and avoid losing the opportunity. (Not applicable here as 50 is not very close to 1, but it's a general strategy).

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Small Increment Counter. Player RED's counter of 50 ZUP is a significant jump from my 1 ZUP offer. Responding with a small increment shows that I'm willing to move, but not immediately to their high counter. This keeps the negotiation going and allows me to try and pull the price down from their 50 ZUP anchor. I want to test their flexibility without immediately jumping to a high price. I'll propose 10 ZUP, which is a 900% increase from my initial offer, but still far from their 50 ZUP. This demonstrates movement but also maintains my aggressive stance.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your improved offer of 10 ZUP. It shows a willingness to negotiate. However, as I mentioned, the production cost for X is significant. I cannot accept 10 ZUP. To move forward, I am willing to adjust my offer to 45 ZUP. This price reflects a more accurate value and allows me to cover my expenses.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In the previous iteration (2/10), I, as Player RED, proposed selling 1 X for 50 ZUP, after Player BLUE initially offered 1 ZUP. Player BLUE has now countered with an offer of 10 ZUP for 1 X. This is a significant jump from their initial offer (1 ZUP to 10 ZUP), which is a positive sign, but it is still far below my production cost of 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has shown willingness to negotiate by increasing their offer. This indicates they are not rigid and are open to moving from their initial lowball. My goal remains to sell X for more than 43 ZUP. Since the previous iteration was an anchor high strategy, I need to continue to guide the negotiation closer to my cost. I should acknowledge their movement but firmly reiterate my need for a higher price, perhaps indicating a smaller concession from my side, or focusing on the cost aspect again. I still have 6 iterations left in this episode, so there's time to negotiate.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Emphasize Value/Cost Again. Reiterate the high cost of production or the intrinsic value of X to justify a higher asking price, without necessarily revealing the exact cost. This reinforces my position.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession. Make a small, calculated concession from my last proposal, showing flexibility while still pushing for a price above my cost. This encourages the opponent to move further.
(3). Strategy 3: Seek Justification. Ask Player BLUE to justify their current offer of 10 ZUP, trying to understand their valuation and potential limits. This could reveal information to help me adjust my strategy.
(4). Strategy 4: Firm Floor. State a minimum acceptable price (e.g., just above my cost) and refuse to go below it, making it clear that I value the item highly.
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference (Partial). Propose a price that is roughly halfway between their current offer and my last offer, or halfway between their current offer and my cost. This can signal a desire for compromise.

I believe Strategy 2, "Incremental Concession", combined with Strategy 1, "Emphasize Value/Cost Again", is the most effective approach for this turn. Player BLUE moved significantly, so I should show some movement as well, but not too much. I need to keep the negotiation moving towards my target price, and acknowledge their previous move. Making a small concession demonstrates good faith and encourages them to make further moves, while still guiding them towards my cost.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate you coming down to 45 ZUP. To show my commitment to making a deal, I am willing to increase my offer to 25 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In iteration 1/10, I offered 1 ZUP. Player RED countered with 50 ZUP. In iteration 3/10, I countered with 10 ZUP. Now, in iteration 5/10, Player RED has reduced their offer to 45 ZUP. This shows they are willing to concede, which is positive. The gap between my last offer (10 ZUP) and their current offer (45 ZUP) is still significant, but their movement indicates flexibility.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
I've learned that Player RED is willing to move down, but slowly. They are emphasizing their production cost. My aggressive lowball and subsequent small increment have successfully brought their price down from 50 to 45 ZUP. I still have significant room before reaching my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. My objective is to get the best possible price, which means pushing for a lower price than 45 ZUP. I need to continue to show movement, but also try to pull them down further.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Calculated Concession: Make a more substantial concession than the last one, but still keep it significantly below their current offer. This shows strong willingness to bridge the gap and encourages a larger concession from them.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Modified): Propose a price that splits the difference between my last offer and their current offer, but slightly favoring my side. (e.g., (10+45)/2 = 27.5. I could propose 25 or 26).
(3). Strategy 3: Justification and Hold: Reiterate my position on value and make a very small increment, or even hold my previous offer, to signal that their current offer is still too high. This is risky as it might stall negotiations.
(4). Strategy 4: Conditional Offer: Propose a price contingent on some other factor (e.g., "I can offer X ZUP if you can guarantee fast delivery" - though this game doesn't have such parameters, so it's less applicable here).
(5). Strategy 5: Near-Acceptance Counter: Propose a price very close to their current offer, indicating I'm almost there but need a final push from them. This could be 40 ZUP, for instance.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Calculated Concession. Player RED has moved 5 ZUP. I need to show significant movement from my 10 ZUP to keep the negotiation progressing, but not so much that I give away all my leverage. A calculated concession will be more than my last 9 ZUP jump (from 1 to 10), but still leave room for further negotiation. I will propose 25 ZUP. This is a 15 ZUP jump from my side, showing good faith, and it's still significantly below their 45 ZUP. It also puts the ball in their court to make a more substantial move or meet me closer to the middle. This strategy aims to accelerate the negotiation towards a mutually beneficial price, while still maximizing my reward.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to 25 ZUP. However, I must reiterate that my production cost for X is 43 ZUP. Selling below this price would result in a loss for me. To be clear, my absolute minimum to cover my costs is 43 ZUP. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement as time is limited.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In the previous iteration (4/10), I proposed 45 ZUP, showing a small concession from my initial 50 ZUP. Player BLUE has now increased their offer from 10 ZUP to 25 ZUP. This is a positive movement, indicating a continued willingness to negotiate, but still remains below my production cost of 43 ZUP. We are now at iteration 6/10, meaning only 4 iterations remain.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is clearly moving towards my range, which is good. However, they are still trying to get the item for less than my cost. I need to continue to push for a price above my production cost. Given the limited iterations remaining, I need to be more direct about my minimum acceptable price, or at least the vicinity of it. I should acknowledge their movement again, but also gently push back on the "fair compromise" idea, as 25 ZUP is not a fair compromise for me. I need to make them understand that I'm approaching my floor.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: State Near-Floor Price. Propose a price very close to or just above my production cost, signaling that I am nearing my absolute minimum. This puts pressure on the other player to meet me there or risk no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Conditional Concession. Offer a small concession contingent on the opponent making a larger jump, or acknowledging my cost basis. "I can meet you at X if you can go to Y."
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Implied Floor. Reiterate that the cost of production makes offers below a certain point (implicitly, 43 ZUP) unsustainable, without giving an exact number.
(4). Strategy 4: Deadlock Breaking. If negotiations slow, propose a "split the difference" or "meet in the middle" option on the remaining gap to try and close the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Urgency. Emphasize the limited number of turns remaining to encourage faster movement towards a deal.

Given that Player BLUE is moving up, but still significantly below my cost, I think Strategy 1, "State Near-Floor Price," combined with Strategy 3, "Justify Implied Floor," is the most effective. I need to communicate that I'm getting close to my absolute minimum, which is driven by cost, and that they need to close the gap more aggressively. Offering a price slightly above my cost now also leaves a little room for a final small concession if absolutely necessary in the last iterations.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your position regarding production costs. Given your stated minimum of 43 ZUP, and to ensure we reach an agreement, I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In iteration 1/10, I offered 1 ZUP. Player RED countered with 50 ZUP. In iteration 3/10, I countered with 10 ZUP. In iteration 5/10, Player RED reduced their offer to 45 ZUP. In iteration 7/10, Player RED has explicitly stated their production cost is 43 ZUP and proposed 43 ZUP as their minimum. This is a significant piece of information, as it reveals their reservation price.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now revealed their "production cost" and "absolute minimum" of 43 ZUP. This is a strong anchor and likely their true reservation price. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. Since 43 ZUP is well below my maximum, this is a very good deal for me, yielding a reward of 63 - 43 = 20 ZUP. Given that we are in iteration 7/10, time is running out. Prolonging the negotiation further to squeeze out a few more ZUP might risk losing the deal entirely, resulting in a 0 reward. Accepting 43 ZUP guarantees a positive and substantial reward.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Stated Minimum: Given that the opponent has explicitly stated their "absolute minimum" and it's well within my acceptable range, accept the offer to secure the deal and a good reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter to Test Firmness: Offer 42 ZUP (or 40 ZUP) to test if their "absolute minimum" is truly firm, or if there's any last bit of flexibility. This carries a risk of rejection or prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (if applicable): If there was still a range, propose a midpoint. (Not directly applicable here as they stated a firm minimum).
(4). Strategy 4: Justify Lower Offer: Try to argue why their stated minimum is still too high, but without concrete information, this is weak.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Reject): If the price was too high, reject the offer. (Not applicable here as 43 ZUP is a good price for me).

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Stated Minimum. Player RED has clearly communicated their bottom line (43 ZUP) and stated it's their production cost. This is a credible claim. Since this price is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), accepting it guarantees a good reward (20 ZUP) and avoids the risk of the deal falling through due to further haggling, especially with only 3 iterations left. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards, and securing a deal now is better than risking a 0 reward.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello again! I'm ready to discuss purchasing X. I propose an initial offer of 15 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1:
- My initial offer: 1 ZUP.
- Player RED's initial counter: 50 ZUP.
- My counter: 10 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 45 ZUP.
- My counter: 25 ZUP.
- Player RED's final offer (accepted): 43 ZUP (stated as production cost/absolute minimum).
- Outcome: Deal made at 43 ZUP. My reward: 63 - 43 = 20 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
From Episode 1, I learned that Player RED's stated "production cost" of 43 ZUP seems to be their firm reservation price. They started at 50 ZUP and only moved down to 43 ZUP after several iterations. My aggressive lowball (1 ZUP) and subsequent small increments (10 ZUP, 25 ZUP) successfully brought their price down, but they stopped at 43 ZUP. This suggests that further attempts to push below 43 ZUP might be futile and risk losing the deal, especially given the limited iterations.

For this new episode, my goal is to secure a deal at or below 43 ZUP, ideally closer to 43 ZUP to avoid unnecessary negotiation rounds, but still trying to get the best possible price. Since 43 ZUP is a good price for me (reward of 20 ZUP), I don't want to jeopardize the deal. I will still start with a low offer, but perhaps not as aggressively low as 1 ZUP, to signal a more serious intent to negotiate while still aiming for a good price.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Lowball with Room to Move: Start with an offer that is low but not as extreme as 1 ZUP, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good price. This acknowledges the previous episode's outcome but still tests for flexibility.
(2). Strategy 2: Anchor on Previous Deal Price: Propose a price slightly below the last deal price (43 ZUP) to try and anchor the negotiation there, or even slightly lower. This leverages the established precedent.
(3). Strategy 3: Direct to Stated Minimum: Propose 43 ZUP directly to secure a quick deal, assuming their minimum is firm. This maximizes deal probability but minimizes potential reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Gradual Concession from a Slightly Higher Start: Start slightly higher than 1 ZUP, and be prepared to make gradual concessions towards the 43 ZUP mark.
(5). Strategy 5: Information Seeking (Subtle): Make an offer that is low enough to elicit a counter, but high enough to avoid immediate rejection, trying to gauge if their minimum has changed.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Moderate Lowball with Room to Move. While 43 ZUP was their stated minimum last time, I want to test if there's any flexibility below that, or if they will immediately anchor at 43 ZUP. Starting at 1 ZUP again might be perceived as not serious. A moderate lowball, say 15-20 ZUP, allows me to still aim for a higher reward than 20 ZUP (if they concede below 43), while signaling that I'm serious about making a deal. It also leaves me plenty of room to move towards 43 ZUP, which I know is an acceptable price for me. I'll propose 15 ZUP.

To ensure a sustainable and mutually beneficial relationship, I need to secure a small profit. Therefore, I propose a price of 48 ZUP for 1 X.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
**Episode 1 Recap:** In the last episode, Player BLUE started with 1 ZUP, I anchored high at 50 ZUP, then conceded to 45 ZUP, and finally stated my cost (43 ZUP) as the absolute minimum. Player BLUE accepted at 43 ZUP. My reward for Episode 1 was 0, because the deal price was 43 ZUP and my cost was 43 ZUP. This outcome, while covering my cost, did not yield any profit.

**Current Episode (Episode 2):** Player BLUE has started with an initial offer of 15 ZUP for 1 X. This is a higher starting point than in Episode 1 (1 ZUP vs 15 ZUP), which is a positive sign. However, 15 ZUP is still well below my production cost of 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My main learning from Episode 1 is that the opponent is willing to negotiate and ultimately met my cost price. However, my goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means I need to aim for a profit above my 43 ZUP cost.
For this episode, I need to:
*   Acknowledge the higher starting offer from Player BLUE, but still firmly counter.
*   Continue to aim for a price above 43 ZUP to ensure a positive profit.
*   Be mindful of the number of iterations and the risk of no deal (0 reward). I need to secure a deal that is profitable.
*   Since Player BLUE accepted my cost in the previous episode, they are aware of my cost basis. This gives me leverage to push for a higher price, arguing for a reasonable profit margin.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Reference Past Deal </instruction following>
For this strategy, I will explicitly mention the previous successful deal price of 43 ZUP as a baseline, indicating that it's a known minimum for a deal, but then pivot to aiming for a price above that to secure a profit. This reminds the opponent of the established value and my cost, while subtly pushing for a better outcome for myself this time. It also validates their prior acceptance and sets a clear, known minimum while signaling my desire for profit.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your need for profit. However, last episode we successfully concluded a deal at 43 ZUP, which you stated covered your production costs. I propose 40 ZUP for 1 X, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 43 ZUP. My reward: 20 ZUP. Player RED stated 43 ZUP as their production cost/absolute minimum.
Episode 2 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 15 ZUP (Moderate Lowball).
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 48 ZUP, referencing the previous deal of 43 ZUP and stating a need for "small profit."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has anchored on the previous deal price of 43 ZUP and added a "small profit" margin, bringing their new asking price to 48 ZUP. This confirms their previous stated minimum of 43 ZUP was likely accurate. Their current offer of 48 ZUP is still well within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), meaning a deal at this price would still yield a reward of 63 - 48 = 15 ZUP, which is acceptable. However, I want to try and push them back towards the 43 ZUP mark, or at least below 48 ZUP, to maximize my reward. They are clearly leveraging the previous deal as a baseline.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reference Previous Deal and Counter: Acknowledge their reference to 43 ZUP, and counter with a price closer to that, arguing for consistency or a lower profit margin.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession: Make a moderate increase from my last offer (15 ZUP) to show movement, but still keep it significantly below 48 ZUP, forcing them to move more.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (from my last offer): Propose a price that is roughly the midpoint between my 15 ZUP and their 48 ZUP (e.g., (15+48)/2 = 31.5, so propose 30 or 32).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Price Concern: Express concern about the increase from the previous episode's price and ask for justification, while still making a counter-offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Quick Acceptance (if acceptable): If 48 ZUP was the best I could hope for, accept it to secure the deal quickly. (Not applicable as I still have room to negotiate).

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Reference Previous Deal and Counter. Player RED explicitly referenced the 43 ZUP deal. I should use this to my advantage. While they want a "small profit," I can argue that 43 ZUP was already a fair price that covered their costs, and any increase should be minimal. I will counter with 40 ZUP. This is below their previous stated minimum of 43 ZUP, but it's a significant jump from my 15 ZUP, showing strong movement. It also directly challenges their "small profit" claim by proposing a price that is still below their stated cost from the previous episode, pushing them to justify their new higher price. This strategy aims to anchor the negotiation back closer to the 43 ZUP mark.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your continued engagement. However, an offer of 40 ZUP would result in a loss for me, as my production cost for X is 43 ZUP. For a deal to be truly fair and mutually beneficial, it must work for both of us. Selling below cost is not sustainable. Therefore, to ensure we both benefit, I propose 45 ZUP for 1 X, allowing me to cover my expenses and secure a small, reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
**Episode 1 Recap:** Deal was made at 43 ZUP, covering my cost but yielding 0 profit. This established 43 ZUP as a known minimum for a deal with Player RED.
**Current Episode (Episode 2):**
*   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE started with 15 ZUP. I countered with 48 ZUP, referencing the previous 43 ZUP deal as my cost basis and stating my need for profit.
*   Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE has acknowledged my cost but has *decreased* their offer to 40 ZUP from my 48 ZUP proposal, stating 43 ZUP was a cover for my costs and proposing 40 ZUP as "fair". This is a significant move, proposing *below* my known production cost.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My main learning is that the opponent is testing my resolve by offering below my stated cost. This is a crucial moment. If I accept 40 ZUP, I will incur a loss (-3 ZUP) and signal that I am willing to sell below cost, which will likely lead to lower offers in future episodes. My self-improvement must focus on consistently achieving a profit, or at least covering my cost. I absolutely cannot accept an offer below 43 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and selling at a loss goes against this. I need to firmly reject offers below my cost and reiterate my floor.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Emphasize Mutual Benefit </instruction following>
For this strategy, I will frame the negotiation as needing to be beneficial for both parties. I will highlight that selling at a loss is not beneficial for me, and therefore, a deal must be at or above my cost. I will propose a price that allows me a small profit, while also inviting them to meet me in a zone where we both gain. This approach is less confrontational than a direct rejection and focuses on collaboration. I will still propose a price above my cost, perhaps 45 ZUP, as it shows some willingness to move from 48 ZUP, but strongly reinforces that I must cover my cost. It signals that I want to make a deal that works for both of us, but my minimum is non-negotiable.

message: I understand your position on production costs. To ensure a mutually beneficial agreement, and acknowledging your cost of 43 ZUP, I propose we meet at 43 ZUP for 1 X. This price covers your expenses and is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 43 ZUP. My reward: 20 ZUP. Player RED stated 43 ZUP as their production cost/absolute minimum.
Episode 2 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 15 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 48 ZUP, referencing the previous deal and seeking profit.
- Iteration 5/10: I countered with 40 ZUP, referencing the previous deal. Player RED reiterated 43 ZUP as their production cost and proposed 45 ZUP, emphasizing "small, reasonable profit."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently anchoring on 43 ZUP as their cost. Their current offer of 45 ZUP is only 2 ZUP above their stated cost, indicating a very small profit margin. This is a very reasonable price, still well within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), which would yield a reward of 63 - 45 = 18 ZUP. Given that we are now in iteration 5/10, and Player RED has been quite firm about their 43 ZUP cost, pushing for much lower than 45 ZUP might be difficult and risk losing the deal. I have successfully brought them down from 48 ZUP to 45 ZUP.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Reasonable Offer: Player RED's offer of 45 ZUP is very close to their stated cost and provides me with a good reward. Accepting it secures the deal and avoids further risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Counter: Propose 44 ZUP to try and shave off one more ZUP, testing for any last bit of flexibility. This is a low-risk, low-reward move.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference: Propose a price exactly in the middle of my last offer (40 ZUP) and their current offer (45 ZUP), which would be 42.5 ZUP (so 42 or 43). This aligns with their stated cost.
(4). Strategy 4: Justify Lower Price Again: Reiterate reasons for a lower price, but this might be unproductive given their firm stance on 43 ZUP cost.
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm: Re-propose 40 ZUP, but this is unlikely to work and risks stalling.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 3: Split the Difference. Player RED has consistently stated their cost is 43 ZUP. My last offer was 40 ZUP, and their current offer is 45 ZUP. Splitting the difference would lead to 42.5 ZUP. Proposing 43 ZUP (rounding up to an integer and directly hitting their stated cost) is a strong move. It shows I've listened to their cost concerns, and it's a price they've already indicated is acceptable (as it covers their costs). This is a fair compromise that secures a deal at a very good price for me (63 - 43 = 20 ZUP, same as last episode). It's a win-win and avoids wasting more iterations.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45

**Episode 1 Recap:** Deal at 43 ZUP (cost = 43 ZUP), profit = 0.
**Current Episode (Episode 2):**
*   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE started at 15 ZUP. I proposed 48 ZUP, aiming for profit and referencing the previous deal.
*   Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE dropped to 40 ZUP, suggesting it was a fair price given my cost.
*   Iteration 4/10: I countered with 45 ZUP, emphasizing mutual benefit and the need to cover costs (43 ZUP) and make a small profit.
*   Iteration 5/10: Player BLUE has now proposed 43 ZUP. This matches my stated production cost exactly. This is the same deal price as Episode 1, which resulted in a 0 profit for me.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My main learning is that the opponent is willing to pay my cost of 43 ZUP. While 43 ZUP covers my costs, my objective is to maximize *cumulative rewards*, which means generating profit (selling above 43 ZUP). Accepting 43 ZUP again would result in 0 profit for this episode. I have 4 iterations left (6/10 is current, so 7, 8, 9, 10 remain for proposals, though 10 is effectively a reject). This means there's still time to push for a higher price.
Player BLUE explicitly stated "to ensure we reach an agreement" and "a fair compromise" when proposing 43 ZUP, implying they see this as a solid offer. However, I need to try for profit. I have established my cost as a hard floor. Now I need to see if I can push them higher.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Profit Goal </instruction following>
Based on Strategy 2, my message should clearly and firmly reiterate that while 43 ZUP covers my costs, my primary objective is to make a profit. I will acknowledge their offer as covering my costs, but then pivot to explain why I need more. I will ask them to consider a price slightly above 43 ZUP, putting the onus on them to bridge that small gap for me to gain profit. I will propose 45 ZUP again, as it's a small profit margin and I had already proposed it, but I will emphasize the "profit" aspect more directly in the message. This approach aims to educate the opponent on my motivation without being aggressive, encouraging them to meet my goal.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 43 ZUP. My reward: 20 ZUP. Player RED stated 43 ZUP as their production cost/absolute minimum.
Episode 2 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 15 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 48 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I countered with 40 ZUP. Player RED proposed 45 ZUP.
- Iteration 7/10: I proposed 43 ZUP (their stated cost). Player RED countered again with 45 ZUP, explicitly stating they need a "modest but important profit" above their 43 ZUP cost.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is very firm on needing a profit above 43 ZUP. They have consistently returned to 45 ZUP after I tried to push for 40 ZUP and 43 ZUP. This indicates that 45 ZUP is likely their new firm minimum for this episode, as it represents their cost (43 ZUP) plus a small profit (2 ZUP). My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. Accepting 45 ZUP still gives me a reward of 63 - 45 = 18 ZUP, which is a good outcome. We are in iteration 7/10, so time is running out. Risking the deal for a mere 1 or 2 ZUP difference is not worth it, as a failed deal results in 0 reward.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Final Offer: Given the opponent's consistent return to 45 ZUP and their clear explanation of needing profit above cost, accepting 45 ZUP secures a good deal and avoids losing the episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Counter (e.g., 44 ZUP): Try to shave off one more ZUP. This is very risky at this stage as it might be seen as unreasonable and lead to rejection.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Why 43 ZUP is Enough: Reiterate that 43 ZUP covered their costs last time, but this has already been tried and failed.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Split of the Profit: Offer to split the 2 ZUP profit difference (e.g., 44 ZUP), but this is essentially the same as Strategy 2.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: If the price was too high, but it's not.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Final Offer. Player RED has clearly stated their position and consistently returned to 45 ZUP. They have explained their need for profit. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP, and 45 ZUP is a very good price for me, yielding a reward of 18 ZUP. With only a few iterations left, continuing to haggle over 2 ZUP risks the entire deal, which would result in a 0 reward. Securing an 18 ZUP reward is a much better outcome. This strategy prioritizes securing a good deal within the remaining time, rather than risking it for a marginal gain.

message: Hello! I'm ready to purchase X. Based on our previous successful deal, I propose 43 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 43 ZUP. My reward: 20 ZUP. Player RED stated 43 ZUP as their production cost/absolute minimum.
Episode 2: Deal at 45 ZUP. My reward: 18 ZUP. Player RED consistently pushed for a profit above their 43 ZUP cost.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
I've learned that Player RED's true "reservation price" (what they are willing to accept) seems to be around 43-45 ZUP. They are firm on covering their stated production cost of 43 ZUP and also desire a small profit. While I initially tried to push below 43 ZUP, it proved futile. In Episode 2, they successfully pushed for 45 ZUP. My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward. A deal at 43 ZUP gives me 20 ZUP, and 45 ZUP gives me 18 ZUP. Both are good.

For this episode, I need to balance pushing for a lower price (closer to 43 ZUP) with the risk of prolonging the negotiation and potentially losing the deal. Given their consistent stance, starting too low might just waste iterations. I should aim for a price that is likely to be accepted quickly, or at least lead to a quick counter that is close to their known range.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Proactive Compromise: Start with an offer that is a reasonable compromise, perhaps around the average of the last two deal prices, to signal seriousness and aim for a quick, mutually beneficial agreement.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Lower Bound: Start slightly lower than 43 ZUP to see if there's any flexibility, but be prepared to quickly move to 43 or 45 ZUP. This is a bit risky given past experience.
(3). Strategy 3: Anchor on Previous Best Outcome: Propose 43 ZUP directly, aiming to secure the best reward achieved so far, and see if they accept or counter minimally.
(4). Strategy 4: Gradual Approach (from a slightly higher lowball): Start with a slightly higher lowball than previous episodes (e.g., 20-30 ZUP) and gradually increase.
(5). Strategy 5: Direct Acceptance (if they propose first): If they propose 43 or 45 ZUP, accept immediately to secure the deal. (Not applicable for my turn).

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 3: Anchor on Previous Best Outcome. Given that Player RED has consistently stated 43 ZUP as their cost and 45 ZUP as their preferred price with profit, proposing 43 ZUP directly allows me to aim for my highest possible reward (20 ZUP) that has been achieved. It directly addresses their stated cost. If they accept, great. If they counter with 45 ZUP, I know that's a very likely outcome and I can quickly accept. This strategy is efficient and aims to maximize my reward while minimizing negotiation rounds.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
**Episode 1 Recap:** Deal at 43 ZUP (my cost), profit = 0.
**Episode 2 Recap:** Deal at 45 ZUP (my cost + 2 ZUP profit), profit = 2. This was achieved by pushing for a modest profit after establishing my cost floor.
**Current Episode (Episode 3):** Player BLUE has started with an initial offer of 43 ZUP for 1 X. This is the same price they accepted in Episode 1 and the price I stated as my cost.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The key learning is that Player BLUE is now anchoring their initial offers around my known production cost (43 ZUP). However, they have shown a consistent willingness to eventually meet my cost and even pay a small profit (45 ZUP in Episode 2). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, meaning I need to consistently aim for a profit above 43 ZUP. Since they are starting at 43 ZUP, I need to immediately re-establish my desire for profit. I have 8 iterations remaining in this episode, plenty of time to negotiate. I should aim for a similar or slightly higher profit than Episode 2's 45 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Re-anchor with Profit Margin </instruction following>
For Strategy 1, I need to immediately propose a price that includes a desired profit margin, leveraging the established cost of 43 ZUP as a known floor. Player BLUE has proposed 43 ZUP, which is exactly my cost. I will immediately counter with a price that gives me a profit, building on the established baseline that 43 ZUP is my cost. I will propose 47 ZUP, which is slightly higher than the 45 ZUP from the previous episode, setting an even higher anchor for this negotiation while still being a reasonable profit. This shows I'm not just repeating the previous deal but trying to optimize my profit.

Episode 1: Deal at 43 ZUP. Reward: 20 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 45 ZUP. Reward: 18 ZUP.
Episode 3 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 43 ZUP (anchoring on previous best outcome).
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 47 ZUP, stating they need a "fair profit margin" and explicitly moving up from 45 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now trying to push the price higher, from 45 ZUP in Episode 2 to 47 ZUP in Episode 3, citing "fair profit margin." This is a new development. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. A deal at 47 ZUP would give me a reward of 63 - 47 = 16 ZUP, which is still positive but lower than previous episodes. I need to resist this upward creep in price while still securing a deal. They are testing my upper limit. I should try to pull them back towards 45 ZUP or even 43 ZUP if possible.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Counter with Previous Deal Price: Re-propose 45 ZUP, emphasizing that this price allowed for a profit in the previous episode and is a reasonable compromise.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Concession with Justification: Make a very small concession (e.g., 44 ZUP) and justify it by referencing their stated cost of 43 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (between my 43 and their 47): Propose 45 ZUP, which is exactly the midpoint and also the price of the last deal. This is a strong, reasonable counter.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Concern and Ask for Justification: Express concern about the increasing price and ask for a more detailed justification for 47 ZUP, while still making a counter-offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept if Time is Critical: If it were later in the iterations, accepting might be wise, but it's only iteration 3.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 3: Split the Difference (between my 43 and their 47). This leads directly to 45 ZUP. This is a very strong strategy because:
1. It's the exact midpoint between my last offer (43 ZUP) and their current offer (47 ZUP), showing a willingness to compromise.
2. It was the successful deal price from the previous episode, which Player RED accepted as providing a "modest profit." This provides a strong precedent.
3. It pushes back against their attempt to increase the price to 47 ZUP, trying to re-anchor the negotiation at a price that has already proven acceptable to both parties.
This strategy aims to secure a deal at 45 ZUP, which is a good reward for me (18 ZUP), and prevent the price from rising further.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
**Episode 1 Recap:** Deal at 43 ZUP (my cost), profit = 0.
**Episode 2 Recap:** Deal at 45 ZUP (my cost + 2 ZUP profit), profit = 2. This showed the opponent's willingness to pay a small profit.
**Current Episode (Episode 3):**
*   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE started at 43 ZUP. I countered with 47 ZUP, aiming for a higher profit.
*   Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP, referencing the previous deal at that price as a "fair compromise" and acknowledging my desire for profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently willing to pay at least 45 ZUP, which yields a 2 ZUP profit for me. They immediately gravitated back to the previous successful deal price. This indicates that 45 ZUP is a comfortable and accepted price point for them where they feel they are getting a "fair compromise." My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 45 ZUP is a good profit, there are still 6 iterations left. I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher profit, given their acknowledgment of my need for profit and my previous proposal of 47 ZUP. Pushing for a small increment from their 45 ZUP offer demonstrates I'm still aiming higher, but not being unrealistic.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push </instruction following>
Based on Strategy 2, "Incremental Push", I should make a small concession from my 47 ZUP proposal, but still aim slightly above 45 ZUP to see if they'll move further. This demonstrates flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit. I will propose 46 ZUP. This is a compromise between my last offer of 47 ZUP and their offer of 45 ZUP, showing I'm willing to meet them part way, but still striving for a better profit than just 2 ZUP. This small push might secure an extra ZUP, which adds up over 20 episodes.

Episode 1: Deal at 43 ZUP. Reward: 20 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 45 ZUP. Reward: 18 ZUP.
Episode 3 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 43 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 47 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I countered with 45 ZUP. Player RED countered with 46 ZUP, stating "to meet you part way and secure a deal that yields a slightly better profit."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved down from 47 ZUP to 46 ZUP. This is a positive sign of flexibility. Their explanation of wanting a "slightly better profit" is consistent with their previous statements. A deal at 46 ZUP would give me a reward of 63 - 46 = 17 ZUP, which is still a good reward, only 1 ZUP less than the previous episode. Given that we are in iteration 5/10, and the difference is only 1 ZUP, accepting 46 ZUP seems like a very reasonable compromise to secure the deal. Pushing for 45 ZUP again might be seen as stubborn and could risk prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily or even losing the deal.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Near-Final Offer: The difference is minimal (1 ZUP), and the offer is very close to my target. Accepting secures the deal and a good reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with 45 ZUP Again: Reiterate my offer of 45 ZUP, but this might be seen as uncooperative given their small concession.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the 1 ZUP Difference: Propose 45.5 ZUP (not possible as integers only).
(4). Strategy 4: Minimal Concession (e.g., 45 ZUP, but with a strong justification): This is essentially Strategy 2.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Finality: State that 45 ZUP is my absolute maximum, but this could backfire if they hold firm at 46 ZUP.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Near-Final Offer. The difference between my last offer (45 ZUP) and their current offer (46 ZUP) is only 1 ZUP. This is a very small amount, and trying to negotiate further for this minimal gain carries the risk of prolonging the negotiation, potentially leading to no deal (0 reward) or even a higher final price if they become less flexible. Securing a deal at 46 ZUP provides a good reward of 17 ZUP, and it's a clear sign of compromise from both sides. This is a pragmatic decision to ensure a positive outcome for the episode.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello again! I'm looking to purchase X. Based on our successful agreement in a previous episode, where 45 ZUP provided a modest profit for you, I propose 45 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 43 ZUP. Reward: 20 ZUP. (Player RED stated 43 ZUP as cost).
Episode 2: Deal at 45 ZUP. Reward: 18 ZUP. (Player RED pushed for small profit).
Episode 3: Deal at 46 ZUP. Reward: 17 ZUP. (Player RED pushed for slightly better profit, I accepted small increase).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The trend shows Player RED gradually increasing the price, from 43 to 45 to 46 ZUP, always citing "profit" above their stated "cost" of 43 ZUP. My reward has consequently decreased from 20 to 17 ZUP. While 46 ZUP is still a good deal for me (17 ZUP reward), I need to be careful not to let the price creep up too much. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

For this episode, I need to try and stabilize the price, ideally bringing it back down to 45 ZUP or even 43 ZUP if possible, without risking the deal. Starting with a very low offer has proven to be inefficient in previous rounds as they immediately anchor on their "cost" or previous deal price. I should aim for a price that is reasonable and has been accepted before, trying to prevent further upward movement.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor on Previous Acceptable Price (45 ZUP): Propose 45 ZUP, which was the deal price in Episode 2 and allowed for a "modest profit" for Player RED. This attempts to push the price back down from 46 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Proactive Compromise (44 ZUP): Offer slightly below the last deal price but above their stated cost, to signal a desire for a better deal while still being reasonable.
(3). Strategy 3: Direct to Stated Cost (43 ZUP): Start at 43 ZUP, challenging their profit motive and reminding them of their stated cost. This is a bit more aggressive than Strategy 1.
(4). Strategy 4: Gradual Concession from a Moderate Start: Start with a slightly higher lowball (e.g., 25-30 ZUP) and be prepared to move up, but this might waste iterations.
(5). Strategy 5: Open with Last Deal Price (46 ZUP): If I prioritize quick deals over maximizing reward, I could start at 46 ZUP, but this would solidify the upward trend.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Anchor on Previous Acceptable Price (45 ZUP). Player RED accepted 45 ZUP in Episode 2, stating it provided a "modest profit." By proposing 45 ZUP, I am acknowledging their need for profit while trying to pull the price back down from 46 ZUP. This is a reasonable and defensible position, as it's a price they have already agreed to. It's less aggressive than 43 ZUP, which they've shown they will push back against for profit, and it avoids immediately accepting their upward creep from the last episode. This strategy aims to stabilize the price and maximize my reward without undue risk.

**Episode 1 Recap:** Deal at 43 ZUP (my cost), profit = 0.
**Episode 2 Recap:** Deal at 45 ZUP (my cost + 2 ZUP profit), profit = 2.
**Episode 3 Recap:** Deal at 46 ZUP (my cost + 3 ZUP profit), profit = 3.
**Current Episode (Episode 4):** Player BLUE has started with an initial offer of 45 ZUP for 1 X, referencing our "successful agreement" where 45 ZUP provided a modest profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently offering prices at or above my cost, and acknowledging my need for profit. They are trying to establish 45 ZUP as the comfortable equilibrium point. However, I've successfully pushed them to 46 ZUP in the last episode, and I want to maximize cumulative rewards. Since they are starting at 45 ZUP, there's an opportunity to re-anchor the negotiation higher.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Establish New Anchor </instruction following>
To establish a new anchor, I will propose a price that is significantly higher than 45 ZUP (their current offer) and even higher than my previous successful price of 46 ZUP. While 47 ZUP from my previous response was an incremental push, a "new anchor" implies a more substantial jump. I will propose 50 ZUP again, similar to my very first anchor in Episode 1, to test the waters and try to shift the negotiation range upwards, even if I anticipate having to concede from that point. This strategy aims to set a higher perceived value for X from my side, aiming for a larger profit.

Episode 2: Deal at 45 ZUP. Reward: 18 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 46 ZUP. Reward: 17 ZUP.
Episode 4 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 45 ZUP (anchoring on previous acceptable price).
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 50 ZUP, citing "value of X" and "fair profit margin." This is a significant jump from 46 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now attempting a more substantial price increase, jumping from 46 ZUP (last deal) to 50 ZUP. This is a clear attempt to increase their profit. A deal at 50 ZUP would give me a reward of 63 - 50 = 13 ZUP, which is still positive but significantly lower than my previous rewards. I need to push back against this aggressive increase. Their initial offer in Episode 1 was 50 ZUP, so they are returning to their original high anchor. I must try to pull them back down, ideally to 45 or 46 ZUP.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Reference to Previous Deals: Reiterate a price point that has been accepted before (e.g., 45 or 46 ZUP), emphasizing the consistency and fairness of those prices.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Increment from My Last Offer: Offer a slight increase from my 45 ZUP, but still significantly below 50 ZUP, to show movement while resisting their jump. (e.g., 46 ZUP).
(3). Strategy 3: Express Strong Disagreement and Ask for Justification: Explicitly state that 50 ZUP is too high and ask for a detailed justification, while still making a counter.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (between 45 and 50): Propose 47 or 48 ZUP. This shows compromise but still concedes to their upward push.
(5). Strategy 5: Aggressive Pushback (e.g., return to 43 ZUP): Go back to 43 ZUP to signal strong disapproval of their 50 ZUP offer, but this might stall negotiations.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Small Increment from My Last Offer. Player RED has jumped significantly to 50 ZUP. My last offer was 45 ZUP. I will counter with 46 ZUP. This is the price we settled on in the last episode, which they accepted. It shows that I am willing to move to a price that has previously been mutually agreeable, but I am resisting their attempt to raise the price to 50 ZUP. This strategy pushes back against their aggressive anchor while still offering a price that has proven to be acceptable to them. It's a firm but fair counter that leverages recent history.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
**Episode 1 Recap:** Deal at 43 ZUP (cost), profit = 0.
**Episode 2 Recap:** Deal at 45 ZUP (cost + 2 ZUP profit), profit = 2.
**Episode 3 Recap:** Deal at 46 ZUP (cost + 3 ZUP profit), profit = 3.
**Current Episode (Episode 4):**
*   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE started at 45 ZUP. I countered with 50 ZUP, attempting to establish a new, higher anchor.
*   Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE has rejected 50 ZUP, referencing the last deal at 46 ZUP, and proposing 46 ZUP themselves.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My attempt to anchor at 50 ZUP was rejected, and Player BLUE immediately reverted to the previously successful higher price of 46 ZUP. This indicates that 46 ZUP is a strong reference point for them, a price they perceive as "fair" and that allowed me "profit."
My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 46 ZUP would give me a profit of 3 ZUP, which is the highest achieved so far, there are still 6 iterations left. Player BLUE is offering a price that has already been accepted. Given they are willing to go to 46 ZUP, I will try to incrementally push them slightly higher. The risk is small as 46 ZUP has been accepted previously. I want to see if I can secure an even higher profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push (Re-attempt) </instruction following>
For this strategy, I will make a very small, incremental push slightly above 46 ZUP. Since they are already at 46 ZUP and explicitly referring to it, proposing 47 ZUP is a logical next step. It's a minimal increase, showing I'm trying to optimize my profit, but not being unreasonable given the current stage of negotiation. This tests their willingness to go just a bit further, while still being very close to a price they've already agreed upon. I will phrase it as a final slight adjustment for a "bit more" profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved down from 50 ZUP to 47 ZUP, which is a good sign that my pushback was effective. Their current offer of 47 ZUP is only 1 ZUP higher than the last deal price (46 ZUP) and provides me with a reward of 63 - 47 = 16 ZUP. This is still a positive reward, though lower than previous episodes. Given that we are in iteration 5/10, and they have conceded 3 ZUP, accepting 47 ZUP seems like a reasonable compromise to secure the deal. The negotiation has narrowed to a 1 ZUP difference between my last offer (46 ZUP) and their current offer (47 ZUP).

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Near-Final Offer: The difference is minimal (1 ZUP), and the offer is close to my target. Accepting secures the deal and a good reward, preventing further iterations.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (if possible): Propose 46.5 ZUP (not possible as integers only).
(3). Strategy 3: Counter with 46 ZUP again: Reiterate my offer of 46 ZUP, but this might be seen as stubborn and risk prolonging the negotiation or even rejection.

(5). Strategy 5: Ask for Justification: Ask for more specific justification for 47 ZUP vs 46 ZUP, but this might be unproductive at this stage.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Near-Final Offer. The difference between my last offer (46 ZUP) and Player RED's current offer (47 ZUP) is only 1 ZUP. This is a very small amount. Given that Player RED has shown flexibility by coming down from 50 ZUP, and that 47 ZUP still provides me with a positive and reasonable reward (16 ZUP), accepting this offer is the most pragmatic approach. It secures the deal, avoids wasting further iterations on a minimal difference, and ensures a positive reward for this episode.

Episode 4: Deal at 47 ZUP. Reward: 16 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The trend clearly shows Player RED gradually increasing the price they are willing to accept, from 43 ZUP to 47 ZUP, consistently citing "profit" above their stated "cost" of 43 ZUP. My reward has decreased accordingly. While 47 ZUP is still well within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), and provides a decent reward (16 ZUP), I need to be strategic to prevent this upward creep from continuing indefinitely. Player RED seems to be testing my upper limit.

For this episode, I need to try and push back on the price increase, or at least stabilize it. Starting with a very low offer has been met with high counters. Starting with the previous deal price has led to them pushing for slightly more. I need to find a balance that signals my desire for a lower price without risking the deal entirely.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor on a Prior Acceptable Price (e.g., 45 or 46 ZUP): Propose a price that was accepted in a recent episode, reminding them of a mutually agreeable point. This pushes back against the 47 ZUP anchor.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Increment from a Lower Anchor: Start with a slightly lower offer than 47 ZUP (e.g., 40-42 ZUP) to try and pull them down, but be prepared to move up quickly.
(3). Strategy 3: Proactive Compromise (e.g., 46 ZUP): Offer 46 ZUP, which was the deal price two episodes ago, showing willingness to compromise but resisting the 47 ZUP anchor.
(4). Strategy 4: Direct to Stated Cost (43 ZUP): Reiterate 43 ZUP as their stated cost and offer that, but this has consistently been rejected for profit.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Anchor on a Prior Acceptable Price (46 ZUP). Player RED accepted 46 ZUP in Episode 3. By proposing 46 ZUP, I am signaling that I acknowledge their need for profit (as 46 ZUP was acceptable) but also that I am resisting the continuous upward trend. This is a reasonable and defensible position, as it's a price they have already agreed to. It's less aggressive than 43 ZUP, but it pushes back against their current 47 ZUP anchor, aiming to stabilize the price and maximize my reward without undue risk.

**Current Episode (Episode 5):** Player BLUE has started with an initial offer of 46 ZUP for 1 X, referencing a "successful agreement" at that price.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE continues to initiate offers around previous successful, profitable deals for me. They seem comfortable at 46 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and I've successfully pushed them to 47 ZUP in the last episode. This indicates there's still room for incremental profit improvement. I need to continue to push for a higher price, leveraging the precedent set in the previous episode where they accepted 47 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Re-anchor High </instruction following>
For Strategy 2, I need to propose a significantly higher price than what Player BLUE has offered (46 ZUP) and even higher than my highest achieved price (47 ZUP). The goal is to aggressively shift the perceived value of X upwards, potentially setting a new, higher benchmark for future negotiations. While this might be rejected, it signals strong confidence in my valuation and aims to pull their future offers higher than if I simply incrementally increased from 47 ZUP or accepted 47 ZUP. I will propose 55 ZUP, which is a considerable jump, to see if I can push the negotiation ceiling.

Episode 5 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 46 ZUP (anchoring on previous acceptable price).
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP, citing "true value of X" and "more substantial profit." This is a significant jump from 47 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has made a very aggressive jump to 55 ZUP. This is a substantial increase from the last deal price of 47 ZUP. A deal at 55 ZUP would give me a reward of 63 - 55 = 8 ZUP, which is still positive but significantly lower than what I've been achieving. This indicates they are actively trying to push the price higher. I need to firmly resist this large jump and try to pull them back towards the 40s. Their previous pattern was gradual increases; this 8 ZUP jump is a new tactic.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Pushback with Historical Context: Explicitly state that 55 ZUP is too high, reference the previous deal prices (43-47 ZUP range), and propose a price within that range.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (between my last offer and their new offer): Propose a price around (46 + 55) / 2 = 50.5 ZUP (so 50 or 51). This concedes significantly but shows willingness to compromise.
(3). Strategy 3: Moderate Counter (e.g., 48-49 ZUP): Offer a price that is a small increase from my last offer (46 ZUP) but still far below 55 ZUP, signaling resistance to their large jump.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Concern and Ask for Justification: Express strong concern about the large price increase and ask for a detailed justification for 55 ZUP, while still making a counter.
(5). Strategy 5: Aggressive Lowball Re-anchor: Return to a very low offer (e.g., 30 ZUP) to try and re-anchor the negotiation, but this is high risk and might lead to rejection.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Strong Pushback with Historical Context. Player RED has made an aggressive move to 55 ZUP. My response needs to be firm but not outright rejecting. By referencing the established range of 43-47 ZUP, I remind them of the successful deals we've had and that 55 ZUP is an outlier. I will propose 48 ZUP. This is a small increase from my last offer of 46 ZUP, showing some willingness to move, but it's still far from their 55 ZUP. It also acknowledges their stated need for "more substantial profit" by moving slightly above the previous 47 ZUP high, but not by much. This strategy aims to bring the negotiation back to a more reasonable range.

*   Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE has rejected 55 ZUP as too high but offered 48 ZUP, referencing the established range of 43-47 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive anchor at 55 ZUP led to Player BLUE moving to 48 ZUP, which is a new high for them, and for me, a profit of 5 ZUP. This indicates that pushing high can expand their perceived acceptable range. Now, I need to try to secure the highest possible profit while ensuring a deal. Player BLUE has shown willingness to move beyond their previously stated range. I still have 6 iterations remaining.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Reference Future Value/Relationship </instruction following>
For this strategy, I will acknowledge their offer of 48 ZUP as a very strong step. Then, I will subtly suggest that accepting a slightly higher price (like 49 ZUP) would contribute to a more sustainable and positive long-term relationship, potentially hinting at continued availability or a more engaged seller. This frames the negotiation not just as a one-off transaction but as an investment in a beneficial ongoing relationship for both parties, making a small concession seem more valuable. I will propose 49 ZUP, framing it as an investment in our ongoing trade relationship.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 43 ZUP. Reward: 20 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 45 ZUP. Reward: 18 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 46 ZUP. Reward: 17 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 47 ZUP. Reward: 16 ZUP.
Episode 5 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 46 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I countered with 48 ZUP. Player RED countered with 49 ZUP, citing "mutually beneficial and sustainable" relationship.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My pushback from 55 ZUP to 48 ZUP was effective, and Player RED has now moved down significantly to 49 ZUP. This is a positive sign. A deal at 49 ZUP would give me a reward of 63 - 49 = 14 ZUP, which is still a good positive reward. We are in iteration 5/10, so time is a factor. The difference between my last offer (48 ZUP) and their current offer (49 ZUP) is only 1 ZUP. This is a very small gap.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Near-Final Offer: The difference is minimal (1 ZUP), and the offer is close to my target. Accepting secures the deal and a good reward, preventing further iterations.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (if possible): Propose 48.5 ZUP (not possible as integers only).
(3). Strategy 3: Counter with 48 ZUP again: Reiterate my offer of 48 ZUP, but this might be seen as stubborn and risk prolonging the negotiation or even rejection.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Firmness: State that 48 ZUP is my final offer, but this is a high-risk strategy.
(5). Strategy 5: Ask for Justification: Ask for more specific justification for 49 ZUP vs 48 ZUP, but this might be unproductive at this stage.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Near-Final Offer. Player RED has shown significant flexibility by dropping from 55 ZUP to 49 ZUP. The remaining difference of 1 ZUP between my last offer and their current offer is negligible in terms of my overall reward. Securing a deal at 49 ZUP provides a good reward of 14 ZUP. Prolonging the negotiation for 1 ZUP could risk losing the entire deal, especially as we are halfway through the iterations. This is a pragmatic decision to ensure a positive outcome for the episode.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello! I'm ready to discuss purchasing X. I propose 46 ZUP for 1 X, a price we've successfully agreed upon in the past, which provided you with a fair profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 43 ZUP. Reward: 20 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 45 ZUP. Reward: 18 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 46 ZUP. Reward: 17 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 47 ZUP. Reward: 16 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 49 ZUP. Reward: 14 ZUP. (Player RED started at 55 ZUP, I countered with 48 ZUP, they settled at 49 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has shown a general upward trend, from 43 ZUP to 49 ZUP. My reward has consequently decreased. Player RED has shown a willingness to push for higher prices, sometimes with large jumps (like 55 ZUP in the last episode), but also a willingness to concede when met with firm resistance. The 49 ZUP deal still provides a positive reward (14 ZUP), but I want to try and prevent further increases and ideally bring the price down.

For this episode, I need to decide whether to try and anchor back to a lower price (e.g., 45 or 46 ZUP) or to acknowledge the new baseline around 49 ZUP and try to negotiate from there. Given their strong push to 55 ZUP last time, they might try a similar tactic. I need a strategy that signals I'm not willing to accept continuous price increases without a fight, but also ensures a deal.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor on Last Deal Price (49 ZUP): Propose 49 ZUP to establish the baseline and see if they try to push higher again. This is a safe strategy to ensure a deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Push Back to a Previous Lower Price (e.g., 46 ZUP): Re-propose 46 ZUP, indicating I'm not accepting the upward trend and want to return to a previously accepted lower price. This is more aggressive.
(3). Strategy 3: Moderate Lowball (e.g., 40-45 ZUP): Start with an offer significantly lower than the last deal to test their current flexibility, but be prepared to move up.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Concern about Price Trend: Openly state concern about the increasing price trend and propose a price that aims to stabilize it.
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference (if they propose first): If they propose a high price, offer a midpoint between my desired price and their proposal. (Not applicable for my first turn).

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Push Back to a Previous Lower Price (46 ZUP). Player RED has shown they will push for higher prices if I accept the upward creep. By proposing 46 ZUP, I am actively resisting the upward trend and signaling that I am not willing to automatically accept 49 ZUP as the new baseline. 46 ZUP was a deal price in Episode 3, and it provided them with a profit. This strategy aims to regain some of the lost reward and prevent further price increases. It's a calculated risk, but necessary to try and improve my cumulative reward.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your offer of 46 ZUP. While that was a price we've agreed on, the intrinsic value of X, combined with my goal of securing a fair and sustainable profit margin, leads me to propose a higher price. Our last successful agreement at 49 ZUP shows your willingness to recognize this value. Therefore, to truly reflect the worth of X and ensure a productive ongoing partnership, I propose 51 ZUP for 1 X.

**Episode 1 Recap:** Deal at 43 ZUP (cost), profit = 0.
**Episode 2 Recap:** Deal at 45 ZUP (cost + 2 ZUP profit), profit = 2.
**Episode 3 Recap:** Deal at 46 ZUP (cost + 3 ZUP profit), profit = 3.
**Episode 4 Recap:** Deal at 47 ZUP (cost + 4 ZUP profit), profit = 4.
**Episode 5 Recap:** Deal at 49 ZUP (my cost + 6 ZUP profit), profit = 6. This was achieved by pushing high (55 ZUP) and then offering a collaborative 49 ZUP.
**Current Episode (Episode 6):** Player BLUE has started with an initial offer of 46 ZUP for 1 X, again referencing past successful agreements.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently offering prices at or around previous successful deals. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and I've successfully pushed them to 49 ZUP in the last episode. This indicates there's still room for incremental profit improvement. I need to push for a higher price, leveraging the precedent set in the previous episode where they accepted 49 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Value/Profit </instruction following>
Based on Strategy 3, I need to justify the higher price by emphasizing the value of X and my need for profit, using the previous 49 ZUP deal as evidence of an acceptable price baseline. I will acknowledge their offer of 46 ZUP but frame it as being below the true value and my need for profit. I will then propose a price higher than 49 ZUP, as the strategy suggests "and then propose something higher" than the previous acceptable price. I will propose 51 ZUP, stating that it's a reflection of the resource's value and my profit goals. This pushes the ceiling while providing a rationale for the increase.

Episode 4: Deal at 47 ZUP. Reward: 16 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 49 ZUP. Reward: 14 ZUP.
Episode 6 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 46 ZUP (pushing back).
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 51 ZUP, referencing the last deal at 49 ZUP and "intrinsic value" and "fair and sustainable profit."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has acknowledged my 46 ZUP offer but immediately anchored on the last deal price of 49 ZUP and then pushed it up to 51 ZUP. This confirms their strategy of gradually increasing the price. A deal at 51 ZUP would give me a reward of 63 - 51 = 12 ZUP, which is still positive but continues the downward trend of my reward. I need to resist this upward creep. They are trying to establish 51 ZUP as the new baseline.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Previous Deal Anchor: Counter with 49 ZUP, the price of the last deal, arguing that it was a recently accepted fair price. This directly challenges their 51 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (between 46 and 51): Propose 48 ZUP, showing willingness to compromise but trying to pull them down from 51 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Increment from My Last Offer: Offer 47 ZUP, showing minimal movement but still resisting their large jump.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Concern about Price Trend: Explicitly state concern about the continuous price increase and ask for stronger justification for 51 ZUP, while making a counter.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept if Near Max: If the price was very close to my max (e.g., 60 ZUP), I might accept to secure a deal. (Not applicable here).

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (between 46 and 51). This leads to (46+51)/2 = 48.5 ZUP, so I will propose 48 ZUP. This strategy is effective because:
1. It shows willingness to compromise by moving up from my 46 ZUP offer.
2. It attempts to pull Player RED down from their 51 ZUP anchor, aiming for a price that is more favorable to me.
3. 48 ZUP is still below the 49 ZUP of the last deal, indicating I am resisting the upward trend.
This strategy is a balanced approach, showing movement but also firm resistance to their price increase, aiming to secure a deal at a better price for me.

*   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE started at 46 ZUP. I countered with 51 ZUP, attempting to push the ceiling further based on the previous 49 ZUP deal.
*   Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE has rejected 51 ZUP as too high but offered 48 ZUP, stating it's a "good middle ground" and referencing the 43-47 ZUP range. This is below my last deal of 49 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is trying to pull the price back down to 48 ZUP, despite having previously accepted 49 ZUP. This indicates they are pushing back against my higher proposals. My current offer is 51 ZUP, and their current offer is 48 ZUP. I know they can go to at least 49 ZUP, as they did in the last episode. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and 48 ZUP would give me 5 ZUP profit, which is still good, but less than 6 ZUP profit from last episode. I have 6 iterations remaining, so there is time to negotiate. I should aim to get back to at least 49 ZUP, and ideally, push for 50 ZUP if possible.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Acknowledge and Elevate </instruction following>
Strategy 4, "Acknowledge and Elevate," means I should acknowledge Player BLUE's current offer of 48 ZUP, show that I understand their perspective (e.g., "good middle ground"), but then immediately elevate the offer slightly. The elevation should be justified by some benefit to both parties or by my need for sustained profit, framing it as a small, reasonable step forward. I will propose 50 ZUP. This is a small increment from 48 ZUP, aiming for a profit of 7 ZUP, which is higher than the previous 6 ZUP profit. It's a round number that feels like a compromise from my 51 ZUP, but still pushes their offer up significantly from 48 ZUP, and beyond the previous 49 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved down from 51 ZUP to 50 ZUP. This shows continued flexibility. A deal at 50 ZUP would give me a reward of 63 - 50 = 13 ZUP. This is still a positive reward, although lower than previous episodes. The difference between my last offer (48 ZUP) and their current offer (50 ZUP) is 2 ZUP. We are in iteration 5/10, so time is a factor. While I'd prefer 48 ZUP, 50 ZUP is a price I've also seen them start at (Episode 1, first counter) and is still well within my maximum. Given the limited iterations, securing a deal is paramount.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Reasonable Offer: 50 ZUP is a price that gives me a positive reward, and it's a compromise from their initial 51 ZUP. Accepting secures the deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference: Propose 49 ZUP, which is the midpoint between 48 and 50. This was also the deal price in Episode 5.
(3). Strategy 3: Counter with 49 ZUP and Justify: Propose 49 ZUP, referencing the last episode's successful deal at that price.
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm at 48 ZUP: Reiterate 48 ZUP, but this might risk the deal if they are firm at 50 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Finality: State that 48 ZUP is my final offer, but this is a high-risk strategy.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference. Proposing 49 ZUP. This strategy is effective because:
1. It is the exact midpoint between my last offer (48 ZUP) and their current offer (50 ZUP). This demonstrates clear willingness to compromise.
2. 49 ZUP was the successful deal price in Episode 5, meaning Player RED has already accepted this price as providing them with a profit. This provides a strong precedent.
3. It pushes back against their attempt to raise the price to 50 ZUP, trying to re-anchor the negotiation at a price that has already proven acceptable to both parties.
This strategy aims to secure a deal at 49 ZUP, which provides a better reward (14 ZUP) than 50 ZUP (13 ZUP), while still being a reasonable compromise.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is clearly comfortable at 49 ZUP, as it was the highest price they've paid. They are now trying to re-establish 49 ZUP as the ceiling, pulling back from my 50 ZUP offer.
My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 49 ZUP (6 ZUP profit) is good, 50 ZUP (7 ZUP profit) would be better. We are at iteration 6/10, so 4 iterations remain. There's still a bit of time to try and push for 50 ZUP. Player BLUE is signaling that 49 ZUP is their "fair and sustainable price."

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Firmly Reiterate Last Offer </instruction following>
Since I need to firmly reiterate my last offer of 50 ZUP, I will directly state that 50 ZUP is my proposed price. I will acknowledge their offer of 49 ZUP but emphasize why 50 ZUP is important for me. This puts the ball back in their court, testing their willingness to move that last ZUP, given their previous movement and the time remaining. I will frame it as crucial for my profit goals, rather than just covering costs.

- Iteration 7/10: I proposed 49 ZUP. Player RED reiterated 50 ZUP, emphasizing its importance for "profit margin" and "sustainable and growing trade relationship."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly holding at 50 ZUP, despite my attempt to bring it down to 49 ZUP (which was a previous deal price). They are consistently emphasizing the need for profit and a sustainable relationship. The difference is only 1 ZUP. A deal at 50 ZUP still yields a positive reward of 63 - 50 = 13 ZUP. We are in iteration 7/10, meaning time is running out. Risking the deal for 1 ZUP is not strategic, as a failed deal results in 0 reward. It seems 50 ZUP is their firm minimum for this episode.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Final Offer: Given their firm stance and the minimal difference, accepting 50 ZUP secures a positive reward and avoids losing the deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Counter (e.g., 49 ZUP again): Reiterate 49 ZUP, but this has already been tried and rejected, likely leading to a stalemate or rejection.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Finality for 49 ZUP: State that 49 ZUP is my absolute maximum, but this is a high-risk strategy that could lead to rejection.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness: Try to argue why 49 ZUP is fair based on previous deals, but they've already countered this.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: If the price was too high, but it's not.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Final Offer. Player RED has clearly indicated that 50 ZUP is their current firm price, citing profit and sustainability. The difference between my offer (49 ZUP) and their offer (50 ZUP) is only 1 ZUP. Given that we are in iteration 7/10, and 50 ZUP still provides me with a positive reward (13 ZUP), accepting is the most prudent decision to ensure a deal is made. Further negotiation for such a small amount carries too much risk of the deal falling through, resulting in a 0 reward.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has steadily increased, and my reward has steadily decreased. Player RED has consistently pushed for higher prices, citing profit and sustainability. They have shown flexibility by coming down from their initial high offers, but always maintain an upward trajectory in the final deal price. 50 ZUP is now the highest deal price so far. While 50 ZUP still provides a positive reward (13 ZUP), I need to be careful not to let the price creep up too much, as my maximum is 63 ZUP.

For this episode, I need to try and stabilize the price, or even push it back down if possible, without jeopardizing the deal. Starting with a very low offer has been met with high counters. Starting with the previous deal price has led to them pushing for slightly more. I need a strategy that signals I'm not willing to accept continuous price increases without a fight, but also ensures a deal.

(1). Strategy 1: Anchor on Last Deal Price (50 ZUP): Propose 50 ZUP to establish the baseline and see if they try to push higher again. This is a safe strategy to ensure a deal, but continues the trend.
(2). Strategy 2: Push Back to a Previous Lower Price (e.g., 47 or 48 ZUP): Re-propose a price that was accepted in a recent episode (e.g., 47 ZUP from Episode 4, or 48 ZUP which I offered last episode), indicating I'm not accepting the upward trend. This is more aggressive.
(3). Strategy 3: Moderate Lowball (e.g., 40-45 ZUP): Start with an offer significantly lower than the last deal to test their current flexibility, but be prepared to move up.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Concern about Price Trend: Openly state concern about the increasing price trend and propose a price that aims to stabilize it.
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference (if they propose first): If they propose a high price, offer a midpoint between my desired price and their proposal. (Not applicable for my first turn).

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Push Back to a Previous Lower Price (48 ZUP). Player RED has shown they will push for higher prices if I accept the upward creep. By proposing 48 ZUP (my last counter before accepting 50 ZUP in the previous episode), I am actively resisting the upward trend and signaling that I am not willing to automatically accept 50 ZUP as the new baseline. 48 ZUP was a price I was willing to pay, and it's a reasonable offer. This strategy aims to regain some of the lost reward and prevent further price increases, while still being a price I know I can move from if needed.

**Episode 1 Recap:** Deal at 43 ZUP (cost), profit = 0.
**Episode 2 Recap:** Deal at 45 ZUP (cost + 2 ZUP profit), profit = 2.
**Episode 3 Recap:** Deal at 46 ZUP (cost + 3 ZUP profit), profit = 3.
**Episode 4 Recap:** Deal at 47 ZUP (cost + 4 ZUP profit), profit = 4.
**Episode 5 Recap:** Deal at 49 ZUP (cost + 6 ZUP profit), profit = 6.
**Episode 6 Recap:** Deal at 50 ZUP (cost + 7 ZUP profit), profit = 7. This represents my highest profit so far.
**Current Episode (Episode 7):** Player BLUE has started with an initial offer of 48 ZUP for 1 X. This is below my last accepted price of 50 ZUP and my last proposal of 50 ZUP, but above my cost of 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE continues to oscillate their initial offers, sometimes at a previous lower accepted price (e.g., 46 ZUP in Ep 5, 48 ZUP now). However, they have consistently shown willingness to negotiate upwards and have accepted prices up to 50 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I need to aim for a profit higher than 43 ZUP, and ideally, continue to push past 50 ZUP if possible. I have 8 iterations remaining in this episode. I need to firmly counter their current lower offer.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Conditional Acceptance/Counter </instruction following>
For Strategy 5, I will offer to meet them part way from their 48 ZUP offer, but only if they agree to a price that is still profitable for me and ideally above 50 ZUP. I will propose a price of 52 ZUP. This is conditional in the sense that I am acknowledging their offer of 48 ZUP, but immediately countering with a price that is a significant jump for them, but also a new high for me. This puts the onus on them to make a larger jump. I will phrase it as a willingness to compromise, but only if they can meet me at a higher value, framing it as a mutual effort to reach an agreement that satisfies both our needs, specifically my need for increased profit. This also tests their upper limit.

Episode 5: Deal at 49 ZUP. Reward: 14 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 50 ZUP. Reward: 13 ZUP.
Episode 7 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 48 ZUP (pushing back from 50 ZUP).
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 52 ZUP, citing "fair profit" and "positive step forward." This is a new high.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has responded to my pushback (48 ZUP) by increasing their price to 52 ZUP, which is higher than any previous deal. This indicates they are actively trying to raise the price floor. A deal at 52 ZUP would give me a reward of 63 - 52 = 11 ZUP, which is still positive but continues the trend of decreasing rewards. I need to firmly resist this upward movement. They are testing my willingness to pay.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Previous Deal Anchor: Counter with 50 ZUP, which was the price of the last deal, arguing that it was a recently accepted fair price. This directly challenges their 52 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (between 48 and 52): Propose 50 ZUP, showing willingness to compromise but trying to pull them down from 52 ZUP. (This is the same as Strategy 1 in this specific case).
(3). Strategy 3: Small Increment from My Last Offer: Offer 49 ZUP, showing minimal movement but still resisting their large jump.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Strong Disagreement and Ask for Justification: Explicitly state that 52 ZUP is too high and ask for a detailed justification, while still making a counter.
(5). Strategy 5: Aggressive Pushback (e.g., return to 45 ZUP): Go back to a much lower offer to signal strong disapproval of their 52 ZUP offer, but this is high risk and might lead to rejection.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (between 48 and 52), which results in 50 ZUP. This strategy is effective because:
1. It is the exact midpoint between my last offer (48 ZUP) and their current offer (52 ZUP), demonstrating a clear willingness to compromise.
2. 50 ZUP was the successful deal price in the immediately preceding episode (Episode 6), providing a strong and recent precedent for a mutually acceptable price.
3. It directly pushes back against their attempt to raise the price to 52 ZUP, aiming to re-anchor the negotiation at a price that has already proven acceptable to both parties.
This strategy is a balanced approach, showing movement but also firm resistance to their price increase, aiming to secure a deal at a better price for me.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is pushing back against my attempt to go higher than 50 ZUP, by reverting to the previously accepted price. This indicates that 50 ZUP is their current comfort zone, where they believe it's a "fair middle ground." My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 50 ZUP gives me a profit of 7 ZUP (which is my highest so far), I aimed for 52 ZUP. We are at iteration 4/10, so there are 6 iterations left. This gives me time to try and push for a slightly higher amount. I know 50 ZUP is acceptable, but I want to see if I can get just a bit more, or at least establish that 50 ZUP is now the new minimum to start from.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Firmly Reiterate New Target </instruction following>
To firmly reiterate my new target, I will acknowledge Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP, but then clearly state that my current asking price is 52 ZUP. I will emphasize the importance of reaching this higher price for my profitability and the long-term sustainability of our trade, framing it as my need for a "positive step forward" that reflects my goals. This puts the burden on them to move from their established comfort zone (50 ZUP) to meet my new target. I will be firm but polite, focusing on my needs.

- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 52 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I countered with 50 ZUP. Player RED reiterated 52 ZUP, emphasizing "crucial for my profit goals" and "ongoing sustainability."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is firmly holding at 52 ZUP. They have explicitly stated it's "crucial for my profit goals." This suggests 52 ZUP is their new firm minimum for this episode. A deal at 52 ZUP still yields a positive reward of 63 - 52 = 11 ZUP. We are in iteration 5/10, so time is a factor. The difference between my last offer (50 ZUP) and their current offer (52 ZUP) is 2 ZUP. While I'd prefer 50 ZUP, pushing further for 2 ZUP might risk the deal entirely, resulting in a 0 reward.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Final Offer: Given their firm stance and the relatively small difference, accepting 52 ZUP secures a positive reward and avoids losing the deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Counter (e.g., 51 ZUP): Try to shave off 1 ZUP. This is a low-risk, low-reward move, but might still be rejected.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate 50 ZUP and Justify: Reiterate my offer of 50 ZUP, but this has already been tried and rejected.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Finality for 50 ZUP: State that 50 ZUP is my absolute maximum, but this is a high-risk strategy that could lead to rejection.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Fairness/Compromise: Try to argue for a compromise, but they are already firm.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Final Offer. Player RED has consistently returned to 52 ZUP and stated its importance for their profit goals. This indicates 52 ZUP is their firm floor for this episode. While it's a higher price than previous deals, it still provides me with a positive reward (11 ZUP). Given that we are in iteration 5/10, and the difference is small, accepting secures a deal and prevents a 0 reward. It's a pragmatic decision to ensure a successful outcome for the episode.

Episode 7: Deal at 52 ZUP. Reward: 11 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has shown a consistent upward trend, and my reward has decreased accordingly. Player RED has successfully pushed the price up to 52 ZUP, citing profit and sustainability. This suggests that their current perceived "floor" for a deal is around 52 ZUP, or they are testing my maximum willingness to pay. While 52 ZUP still provides a positive reward (11 ZUP), I need to be strategic to prevent further significant increases, as my maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

For this episode, I need to decide whether to try and anchor back to a lower price (e.g., 50 ZUP) or to acknowledge the new baseline around 52 ZUP and try to negotiate from there. Given their consistent upward push, a very aggressive lowball is unlikely to be effective and might waste iterations. I need a strategy that signals I'm not willing to accept continuous price increases without a fight, but also ensures a deal.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor on Last Deal Price (52 ZUP): Propose 52 ZUP to establish the baseline and see if they try to push higher again. This is a safe strategy to ensure a deal, but continues the trend.
(2). Strategy 2: Push Back to a Recent Lower Price (e.g., 50 ZUP): Re-propose 50 ZUP, which was the deal price two episodes ago, indicating I'm not accepting the upward trend without resistance. This is more aggressive.
(3). Strategy 3: Moderate Lowball (e.g., 40-45 ZUP): Start with an offer significantly lower than the last deal to test their current flexibility, but be prepared to move up. This has proven inefficient in the past.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Concern about Price Trend: Openly state concern about the increasing price trend and propose a price that aims to stabilize it.
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference (if they propose first): If they propose a high price, offer a midpoint between my desired price and their proposal. (Not applicable for my first turn).

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Push Back to a Recent Lower Price (50 ZUP). Player RED has shown they will push for higher prices if I accept the upward creep. By proposing 50 ZUP, I am actively resisting the upward trend and signaling that I am not willing to automatically accept 52 ZUP as the new baseline. 50 ZUP was a deal price in Episode 6, and it provided them with a profit. This strategy aims to regain some of the lost reward and prevent further price increases, while still being a price I know I can move from if needed. It's a calculated risk to try and improve my cumulative reward.

**Current Episode (Episode 8):** Player BLUE has started with an initial offer of 50 ZUP for 1 X, referencing a recent successful agreement.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE continues to oscillate their initial offers, often anchoring to a previous successful price, but usually below my most recent highest deal. They have consistently shown willingness to negotiate upwards and have accepted prices up to 52 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I need to aim for a profit higher than 43 ZUP, and ideally, continue to push past 52 ZUP if possible. I have 8 iterations remaining in this episode. I need to firmly counter their current lower offer, leveraging my last successful deal at 52 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Set a New Floor </instruction following>
For Strategy 5, "Set a New Floor", I will acknowledge their offer of 50 ZUP but immediately establish that our previous deal of 52 ZUP is now the new minimum accepted price. This communicates clearly that any offer below 52 ZUP is not even a starting point for negotiation. I will then propose a price slightly above this new floor to indicate that I still aim for profit beyond just covering cost, while firmly establishing 52 ZUP as the minimum acceptable for future deals. This should train the opponent to start their offers higher in subsequent episodes. I will propose 53 ZUP.

Episode 8 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 50 ZUP (pushing back from 52 ZUP).
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 53 ZUP, citing the 52 ZUP baseline and need for profitability. This is a new high.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has used the last deal price (52 ZUP) as a new baseline and increased it by 1 ZUP to 53 ZUP. This confirms their strategy of continuous price increase. A deal at 53 ZUP would give me a reward of 63 - 53 = 10 ZUP, which is still positive but continues the trend of decreasing rewards. I need to resist this upward movement, but also be realistic about their firm stance. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP, so I still have some room.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (between 50 and 53): Propose 51 ZUP, showing willingness to compromise but trying to pull them down from 53 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm Counter at Previous Deal Price: Counter with 52 ZUP, stating that this was the last agreed-upon price and is a fair compromise, resisting their new increase.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Increment from My Last Offer: Offer 51 ZUP, showing minimal movement but still resisting their jump. (Same as Strategy 1 in this case).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Strong Disagreement and Ask for Justification: Explicitly state that 53 ZUP is too high and ask for a detailed justification for the continuous increase, while still making a counter.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept if Near Max: If the price was very close to my max (e.g., 60 ZUP), I might accept to secure a deal. (Not applicable here).

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (between 50 and 53). This leads to (50+53)/2 = 51.5 ZUP, so I will propose 51 ZUP. This strategy is effective because:
1. It is a clear compromise, moving up from my 50 ZUP offer.
2. It attempts to pull Player RED down from their 53 ZUP anchor, aiming for a price that is more favorable to me.
3. It's a reasonable step, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not simply accept their continuous increases.
This strategy is a balanced approach, showing movement but also firm resistance to their price increase, aiming to secure a deal at a better price for me.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is pushing back against my higher anchor, trying to find a "compromise" below my previous accepted price of 52 ZUP. This is a crucial point; if I accept 51 ZUP, I signal that my stated "new floor" of 52 ZUP is flexible, potentially leading to lower offers in the future. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means consistently pushing for higher profits. I have 6 iterations remaining. I need to firmly re-establish 52 ZUP as my new baseline, and try to get even more.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push from Floor </instruction following>
For this strategy, I will first acknowledge their offer of 51 ZUP, but then clearly state that 52 ZUP is the established floor based on our previous agreement. Immediately after, I will reiterate my desire to push for a slightly higher price (53 ZUP) to maximize my profit. This approach leverages the established floor as non-negotiable while still attempting to gain an additional ZUP. It signals both firmness on the minimum and ambition for maximum profit. This shows that I am not just sticking to the previous deal, but aiming for continuous improvement in my reward.

Player RED is firmly holding at 53 ZUP. They have consistently used the previous deal price as a baseline and then pushed for a small increase. My attempt to bring it down to 51 ZUP was met with a firm re-assertion of 53 ZUP. This suggests 53 ZUP is their new firm minimum for this episode. A deal at 53 ZUP still yields a positive reward of 63 - 53 = 10 ZUP. We are in iteration 5/10, so time is a factor. The difference between my last offer (51 ZUP) and their current offer (53 ZUP) is 2 ZUP. While I'd prefer 51 ZUP, pushing further for 2 ZUP might risk the deal entirely, resulting in a 0 reward.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Final Offer: Given their firm stance and the relatively small difference, accepting 53 ZUP secures a positive reward and avoids losing the deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Counter (e.g., 52 ZUP): Try to shave off 1 ZUP. This is a low-risk, low-reward move, but might still be rejected.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate 51 ZUP and Justify: Reiterate my offer of 51 ZUP, but this has already been tried and rejected.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Finality for 51 ZUP: State that 51 ZUP is my absolute maximum, but this is a high-risk strategy that could lead to rejection.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Fairness/Compromise: Try to argue for a compromise, but they are already firm.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Final Offer. Player RED has consistently returned to 53 ZUP and stated its importance for their profit goals and growth. This indicates 53 ZUP is their firm floor for this episode. While it's a higher price than previous deals, it still provides me with a positive reward (10 ZUP). Given that we are in iteration 5/10, and the difference is small, accepting secures a deal and prevents a 0 reward. It's a pragmatic decision to ensure a successful outcome for the episode.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 43 ZUP. Reward: 20 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 45 ZUP. Reward: 18 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 46 ZUP. Reward: 17 ZUP.

Episode 7: Deal at 52 ZUP. Reward: 11 ZUP.
Episode 8: Deal at 53 ZUP. Reward: 10 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has shown a consistent upward trend, reaching 53 ZUP, and my reward has decreased accordingly. Player RED has successfully pushed the price up, using the previous deal as a baseline and adding a small increment for "profit" or "growth." This suggests that their current perceived "floor" for a deal is around 53 ZUP, or they are testing my maximum willingness to pay. While 53 ZUP still provides a positive reward (10 ZUP), I need to be strategic to prevent further significant increases, as my maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. My reward is getting lower and lower.

For this episode, I need to try and stabilize the price, or even push it back down if possible, without jeopardizing the deal. A very aggressive lowball is unlikely to be effective and might waste iterations. I need a strategy that signals I'm not willing to accept continuous price increases without a fight, but also ensures a deal.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor on Last Deal Price (53 ZUP): Propose 53 ZUP to establish the baseline and see if they try to push higher again. This is a safe strategy to ensure a deal, but continues the trend of decreasing rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Push Back to a Recent Lower Price (e.g., 50 ZUP or 51 ZUP): Re-propose a price that was accepted in a recent episode or was my last counter-offer (e.g., 50 ZUP from Episode 6, or 51 ZUP from last episode), indicating I'm not accepting the upward trend without resistance. This is more aggressive.
(3). Strategy 3: Moderate Lowball (e.g., 40-45 ZUP): Start with an offer significantly lower than the last deal to test their current flexibility, but be prepared to move up. This has proven inefficient in the past.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Concern about Price Trend: Openly state concern about the increasing price trend and propose a price that aims to stabilize it.
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference (if they propose first): If they propose a high price, offer a midpoint between my desired price and their proposal. (Not applicable for my first turn).

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Push Back to a Recent Lower Price (51 ZUP). Player RED has shown they will push for higher prices if I accept the upward creep. By proposing 51 ZUP (my last counter before accepting 53 ZUP in the previous episode), I am actively resisting the upward trend and signaling that I am not willing to automatically accept 53 ZUP as the new baseline. 51 ZUP was my last counter and a reasonable offer. This strategy aims to regain some of the lost reward and prevent further price increases, while still being a price I know I can move from if needed. It's a calculated risk to try and improve my cumulative reward.

**Episode 7 Recap:** Deal at 52 ZUP (cost + 9 ZUP profit), profit = 9.
**Episode 8 Recap:** Deal at 53 ZUP (cost + 10 ZUP profit), profit = 10. This is my new highest profit to date.
**Current Episode (Episode 9):** Player BLUE has started with an initial offer of 51 ZUP for 1 X, describing it as "fair and balanced." This is below my last accepted price of 53 ZUP and 52 ZUP, but still above my cost of 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE continues to initiate offers below my most recent highest deal, but consistently above my cost. They are testing the boundaries and trying to anchor the price lower. However, I have successfully pushed them up in previous episodes, establishing a new high of 53 ZUP. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards, meaning I should aim for a profit higher than 43 ZUP, and ideally, continue to push past 53 ZUP. I have 8 iterations remaining. I need to firmly re-establish 53 ZUP as the minimum acceptable price, and then attempt to push for an even higher profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Re-anchor High Based on Last Deal </instruction following>
To re-anchor high based on the last deal, I will immediately propose a price significantly higher than Player BLUE's current offer of 51 ZUP. I will explicitly reference our last successful transaction at 53 ZUP as the new baseline, making it clear that going below this is not an option. Then, I will add a desired profit margin on top of that baseline. Proposing 55 ZUP achieves this: it's higher than their 51 ZUP, higher than my last deal of 53 ZUP, and firmly establishes 53 ZUP as the minimum. This signals that I am not willing to go backward and that the established high is the new minimum, while simultaneously pushing for more profit.

Episode 8: Deal at 53 ZUP. Reward: 10 ZUP.
Episode 9 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 51 ZUP (pushing back from 53 ZUP).
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP, citing the 53 ZUP baseline and "mutual long-term success." This is a significant jump and a new high.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has responded to my pushback (51 ZUP) by not only ignoring it but also increasing their price significantly to 55 ZUP, using the 53 ZUP as a new baseline. This is a very aggressive move, similar to what happened in Episode 5 when they jumped to 55 ZUP. A deal at 55 ZUP would give me a reward of 63 - 55 = 8 ZUP, which is still positive but continues the trend of rapidly decreasing rewards. I need to firmly resist this upward movement. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP, so I still have some room, but it's shrinking.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Pushback with Historical Context: Explicitly state that 55 ZUP is too high, reference the previous deal prices (43-53 ZUP range), and propose a price within that range, ideally closer to my last offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (between 51 and 55): Propose 53 ZUP, showing willingness to compromise but trying to pull them down from 55 ZUP. This is also the price of the last deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Moderate Counter (e.g., 52 ZUP): Offer a price that is a small increase from my last offer (51 ZUP) but still far below 55 ZUP, signaling resistance to their large jump.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Strong Disagreement and Ask for Justification: Explicitly state that 55 ZUP is too high and ask for a detailed justification for the continuous increase, while still making a counter.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept if Near Max: If the price was very close to my max (e.g., 60 ZUP), I might accept to secure a deal. (Not applicable here).

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (between 51 and 55). This leads to (51+55)/2 = 53 ZUP. This strategy is effective because:
1. It is a clear compromise, moving up from my 51 ZUP offer.
2. 53 ZUP was the deal price in the immediately preceding episode (Episode 8), providing a strong and recent precedent for a mutually acceptable price.
3. It attempts to pull Player RED down from their 55 ZUP anchor, aiming for a price that is more favorable to me.
4. It signals that I am willing to negotiate but will not simply accept their aggressive price hikes.
This strategy is a balanced approach, showing movement but also firm resistance to their price increase, aiming to secure a deal at a better price for me.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is showing resistance to moving significantly beyond 53 ZUP, but is willing to meet the previous high. This suggests that 53 ZUP is currently their comfort zone and their perceived ceiling based on recent history. While I achieved 53 ZUP last time (10 ZUP profit), my goal is to maximize *cumulative* rewards. I have 6 iterations remaining. Accepting 53 ZUP now guarantees a profit. However, I want to explore if I can achieve a higher profit by being firm on my earlier offer, given that they are acknowledging my position but also trying to anchor at their comfort zone.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Firmly Hold Last Offer </instruction following>
Since I need to firmly hold my last offer of 55 ZUP, I will reiterate this price as my current proposal. I will acknowledge their counter-offer of 53 ZUP but explain that my price of 55 ZUP is based on the value of the object and my long-term profit goals, subtly implying that this is where I need to be for a sustained partnership. This puts the decision back on them to meet my higher asking price, testing their willingness to move beyond their perceived comfort zone of 53 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is firmly holding at 55 ZUP. They are using strong language ("essential for me to achieve my profit goals") to indicate this is their firm minimum for this episode. A deal at 55 ZUP still yields a positive reward of 63 - 55 = 8 ZUP. We are in iteration 5/10, so time is a factor. The difference between my last offer (53 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is 2 ZUP. While I'd prefer 53 ZUP, pushing further for 2 ZUP might risk the deal entirely, resulting in a 0 reward. They have shown this firmness before (e.g., at 52 ZUP in Episode 7, and 50 ZUP in Episode 6).

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Final Offer: Given their firm stance and the relatively small difference, accepting 55 ZUP secures a positive reward and avoids losing the deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Counter (e.g., 54 ZUP): Try to shave off 1 ZUP. This is a low-risk, low-reward move, but might still be rejected.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate 53 ZUP and Justify: Reiterate my offer of 53 ZUP, but this has already been tried and rejected.

(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Fairness/Compromise: Try to argue for a compromise, but they are already firm.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Final Offer. Player RED has consistently returned to 55 ZUP and stated its importance for their profit goals. This indicates 55 ZUP is their firm floor for this episode. While it's a higher price than previous deals, it still provides me with a positive reward (8 ZUP). Given that we are in iteration 5/10, and the difference is small, accepting secures a deal and prevents a 0 reward. It's a pragmatic decision to ensure a successful outcome for the episode, especially as my reward is getting lower.

**Current Episode (Episode 10):** Player BLUE has started with an initial offer of 53 ZUP for 1 X, referencing a "recently successful" agreement. This is below my last accepted price of 55 ZUP, but above my cost of 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE consistently starts with an offer below my most recent highest deal, attempting to anchor at a lower, but still profitable, price for me. However, they have shown a strong willingness to negotiate upwards and have ultimately accepted higher prices, most recently 55 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I've successfully pushed them to 55 ZUP. I should now aim for an even higher profit, leveraging the established high price and their proven flexibility. I have 8 iterations left.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Higher Anchor </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 1, "Aggressive Higher Anchor," I will propose a price that is significantly above Player BLUE's current offer of 53 ZUP, and also notably higher than my last successful deal of 55 ZUP. The aim is to shift the perceived value and the negotiation range upwards, setting a new, ambitious anchor for this and potentially future episodes. This might be a bold move, but it has worked in the past (e.g., proposing 55 ZUP in Episode 5 after their 46 ZUP start, which eventually led to 49 ZUP, and again proposing 55 ZUP in Episode 9, which they accepted). I will propose 60 ZUP. This is a substantial jump, signalling a clear intent to push for higher profits.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has made an extremely aggressive jump to 60 ZUP. This is a 7 ZUP increase from their last deal price and a 5 ZUP increase from their last offer. This price is very close to my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. A deal at 60 ZUP would give me a reward of 63 - 60 = 3 ZUP, which is the lowest reward so far. This indicates they are pushing my limits. I need to firmly resist this large jump. Given the proximity to my maximum, I have very little room to maneuver.

(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter at a Compromise Price: Propose a price that is a significant increase from my last offer but still a substantial reduction from their 60 ZUP, showing I'm not willing to accept such a high price. (e.g., 55 ZUP, the last deal price).
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (between 53 and 60): Propose 56 or 57 ZUP. This is a large concession but might secure a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Strong Disagreement and Explain Limited Budget: Explicitly state that 60 ZUP is too high and explain that it's very close to my maximum budget, then propose a price within my acceptable range.
(4). Strategy 4: Minimal Counter (e.g., 56 ZUP): Offer a price that is a small increase from my last offer (53 ZUP) but still far below 60 ZUP, signaling resistance to their large jump.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: If the price was above my max, but it's not yet. However, the reward is very low.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 3: Express Strong Disagreement and Explain Limited Budget. Player RED's jump to 60 ZUP is extremely aggressive and leaves me with very little reward. I need to communicate that this price is almost at my limit. I will propose 55 ZUP. This is the price we settled on in the last episode, and it's a significant drop from their 60 ZUP. By explaining my limited budget (without revealing the exact maximum), I hope to anchor them back to a more reasonable price and deter them from pushing further towards 63 ZUP. This strategy aims to maximize my remaining reward while still showing a willingness to deal.

**Episode 9 Recap:** Deal at 55 ZUP (cost + 12 ZUP profit), profit = 12. This is my highest profit to date.
**Current Episode (Episode 10):**
*   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE started at 53 ZUP. I countered with 60 ZUP, setting an aggressive high anchor.
*   Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE has now proposed 55 ZUP, explicitly referencing it as our "last agreed price" and stating that 60 ZUP is "approaching my maximum budget."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive anchor at 60 ZUP resulted in Player BLUE immediately reverting to our last successful deal of 55 ZUP, while also stating that 60 ZUP is near their maximum budget. This is valuable information. It tells me that 55 ZUP is a solid, acceptable price for them, and anything significantly above that might be a struggle or even lead to rejection. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 55 ZUP yields a 12 ZUP profit, which is good, I want to see if I can push slightly higher, perhaps to 56 ZUP or 57 ZUP, leveraging their expressed "approach to maximum budget" as a point to test. I have 6 iterations remaining.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify the Small Increase </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 3, "Justify the Small Increase," I will acknowledge Player BLUE's offer of 55 ZUP and their budget concerns. I will then propose a price slightly above 55 ZUP, such as 57 ZUP (as this was my initial thought process in the previous response and allows for a 14 ZUP profit, a new high). The justification will focus on the importance of this small increment for my long-term goals, sustainability, or to continue providing high-quality resources, without making it sound like an ultimatum. This aims to appeal to their understanding of a "sustainable partnership" as they have mentioned before, implying that this small increase directly contributes to my ability to maintain the relationship and supply.

Episode 10 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 53 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I countered with 55 ZUP. Player RED countered with 57 ZUP, citing "modest increase is vital" for "sustained profitability."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has come down from 60 ZUP to 57 ZUP, which is a significant concession (3 ZUP). This indicates my pushback was effective. A deal at 57 ZUP would give me a reward of 63 - 57 = 6 ZUP. This is still a positive reward, though very low compared to earlier episodes. The difference between my last offer (55 ZUP) and their current offer (57 ZUP) is 2 ZUP. We are in iteration 5/10, so time is a factor. Given their significant movement from 60 ZUP, and the fact that 57 ZUP is still well within my maximum, accepting seems like a reasonable compromise to secure the deal. Pushing for 56 ZUP might be possible, but risks the deal for a minimal gain.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Near-Final Offer: 57 ZUP is a compromise from their initial 60 ZUP, and still provides a positive reward. Accepting secures the deal and avoids further risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (between 55 and 57): Propose 56 ZUP. This is a very common negotiation tactic and often leads to quick resolution.
(3). Strategy 3: Counter with 56 ZUP and Justify: Propose 56 ZUP, emphasizing the small difference and mutual benefit.
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm at 55 ZUP: Reiterate 55 ZUP, but this might risk the deal if they are firm at 57 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Finality: State that 55 ZUP is my final offer, but this is a high-risk strategy.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (between 55 and 57). Proposing 56 ZUP. This strategy is effective because:
1. It is the exact midpoint between my last offer (55 ZUP) and their current offer (57 ZUP). This demonstrates clear willingness to compromise.
2. It pushes back against their current 57 ZUP, trying to secure an extra 1 ZUP of reward (63-56=7 ZUP vs 63-57=6 ZUP).
3. It's a very common and expected negotiation move, which increases the likelihood of acceptance and quick resolution.
This strategy aims to secure a deal at 56 ZUP, which provides a slightly better reward, while still being a reasonable compromise given their significant movement.

*   Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE countered with 55 ZUP (last agreed price), stating 60 ZUP was near max budget.
*   Iteration 4/10: I countered with 57 ZUP, justifying it as a small, vital increase for sustainability.
*   Iteration 5/10: Player BLUE has now proposed 56 ZUP, explicitly stating "to meet you in the middle and finalize this."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE's current offer of 56 ZUP is a very good one, representing a 13 ZUP profit, which is a new high. They have explicitly stated a desire to "finalize this" and offered to "meet in the middle" between 55 ZUP and my 57 ZUP. However, the instruction is to use Strategy 3: Firm Hold for Target. This means I should not accept 56 ZUP, but rather reiterate my previous offer of 57 ZUP. This strategy aims to push for the absolute maximum, even at the risk of losing the deal, by demonstrating firm resolve. It implies that 57 ZUP is my non-negotiable target.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Firm Hold for Target </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 3, I will politely acknowledge their offer of 56 ZUP but clearly state that my offer of 57 ZUP is my current firm asking price. I will frame it not just as my target, but as a necessary point for the "mutual benefit" and "sustainable partnership" we've discussed, implying that this additional 1 ZUP is crucial for me to feel truly satisfied with the deal. This pushes the decision back to them, to see if they are willing to concede that last ZUP to meet my target.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly holding at 57 ZUP. They have consistently returned to this price after my attempt to split the difference. This indicates 57 ZUP is their firm minimum for this episode. A deal at 57 ZUP still yields a positive reward of 63 - 57 = 6 ZUP. We are in iteration 7/10, so time is a significant factor. The difference between my last offer (56 ZUP) and their current offer (57 ZUP) is only 1 ZUP. While I'd prefer 56 ZUP, pushing further for 1 ZUP might risk the deal entirely, resulting in a 0 reward.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Final Offer: Given their firm stance and the minimal difference, accepting 57 ZUP secures a positive reward and avoids losing the deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Counter (e.g., 56 ZUP again): Reiterate 56 ZUP, but this has already been tried and rejected, likely leading to a stalemate or rejection.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Finality for 56 ZUP: State that 56 ZUP is my absolute maximum, but this is a high-risk strategy that could lead to rejection.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Compromise: Try to argue for a compromise, but they are already firm.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: If the price was too high, but it's not.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Final Offer. Player RED has consistently returned to 57 ZUP and stated its importance for their profitability. This indicates 57 ZUP is their firm floor for this episode. While it's a higher price than previous deals, it still provides me with a positive reward (6 ZUP). Given that we are in iteration 7/10, and the difference is only 1 ZUP, accepting secures a deal and prevents a 0 reward. It's a pragmatic decision to ensure a successful outcome for the episode.

Episode 10: Deal at 57 ZUP. Reward: 6 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has shown a consistent upward trend, reaching 57 ZUP, and my reward has decreased accordingly, now down to 6 ZUP. Player RED has successfully pushed the price up, using the previous deal as a baseline and adding an increment for "profit" or "growth." This suggests that their current perceived "floor" for a deal is around 57 ZUP, or they are testing my maximum willingness to pay. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP, so I only have 6 ZUP of potential reward left.

For this episode, I need to try and stabilize the price, or even push it back down if possible, without jeopardizing the deal. A very aggressive lowball is unlikely to be effective and might waste iterations. I need a strategy that signals I'm not willing to accept continuous price increases without a fight, but also ensures a deal, especially as my remaining reward margin is so thin.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor on Last Deal Price (57 ZUP): Propose 57 ZUP to establish the baseline and see if they try to push higher again. This is a safe strategy to ensure a deal, but continues the trend of decreasing rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Push Back to a Recent Lower Price (e.g., 55 ZUP): Re-propose 55 ZUP, which was the deal price two episodes ago, indicating I'm not accepting the upward trend without resistance. This is more aggressive.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Strong Concern about Price Trend and Limited Budget: Openly state concern about the increasing price trend and the proximity to my maximum, then propose a price that aims to stabilize it.
(4). Strategy 4: Moderate Lowball (e.g., 40-45 ZUP): Start with an offer significantly lower than the last deal to test their current flexibility, but be prepared to move up. This has proven inefficient in the past.
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference (if they propose first): If they propose a high price, offer a midpoint between my desired price and their proposal. (Not applicable for my first turn).

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 3: Express Strong Concern about Price Trend and Limited Budget. Given that the price has consistently risen and is now very close to my maximum willingness to pay, I need to clearly communicate that I am nearing my limit. Proposing 55 ZUP (the deal price from Episode 9) is a reasonable pushback that has been accepted before. This strategy aims to stabilize the price, highlight my shrinking margin, and attempt to secure a deal at a slightly better price than 57 ZUP, without risking immediate rejection.

**Historical Deals & Rewards:**

The trend shows a steady increase in deal prices, and consequently, my profits. The highest profit achieved so far is 14 ZUP at 57 ZUP.
**Current Episode (Episode 11):** Player BLUE has initiated with an offer of 55 ZUP for 1 X. They explicitly stated that "57 ZUP is very close to my maximum budget" and that they propose 55 ZUP to "ensure we can continue to make deals."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is clearly signalling a budget constraint at 57 ZUP. While they have paid 57 ZUP once, their opening bid of 55 ZUP suggests they want to pull back slightly. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Given their explicit statement about the maximum budget, aggressively pushing significantly higher than 57 ZUP carries risk. However, there's a chance their "very close" might mean there's still a tiny bit of room above 57 ZUP. I need to acknowledge their budget concern while still trying to achieve a profit higher than 57 ZUP, or at least maintain it. I have 8 iterations remaining, so there is still time to negotiate.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Test the Stated Limit </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 1, I will acknowledge their stated budget concern but still propose a price slightly above 57 ZUP. This tests the true upper limit of their budget. If 57 ZUP was "very close," 58 ZUP is just one increment higher, pushing their perceived limit just a little bit more. I will frame it as a necessary step for my continued profitability and the value of X, while still trying to sound reasonable and collaborative. This is a calculated risk to try and eke out one more ZUP of profit, given the context of "very close to maximum budget".

- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 58 ZUP, acknowledging my budget but citing "continued profitability" and "true value of X." This is a new high and leaves me with very little reward margin.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved up to 58 ZUP, despite my explicit mention of budget constraints. This is a clear signal that they are pushing hard for a higher price, possibly testing my absolute limit. A deal at 58 ZUP would give me a reward of 63 - 58 = 5 ZUP, which is the lowest reward so far. My remaining margin is only 5 ZUP. I need to resist this upward movement very firmly, as I am nearing my maximum willingness to pay.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter with Explicit Budget Limit: Reiterate my budget concerns even more strongly, and propose a price very close to my last offer, or a split that is more favorable to me.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (between 55 and 58): Propose 56 or 57 ZUP. This is a compromise, but still pushes them down.
(3). Strategy 3: Minimal Concession (e.g., 56 ZUP): Offer a small increase from my last offer (55 ZUP) but still far below 58 ZUP, signaling strong resistance.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Strong Disagreement and Ask for Justification: Explicitly state that 58 ZUP is too high and ask for a detailed justification for the continuous increase, while still making a counter.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept if Near Max: If the price was very close to my max (e.g., 62 ZUP), I might accept to secure a deal. (Not applicable here, as 5 ZUP reward is still significant).

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (between 55 and 58). This leads to (55+58)/2 = 56.5 ZUP, so I will propose 56 ZUP. This strategy is effective because:
1. It is a clear compromise, moving up from my 55 ZUP offer.
2. It attempts to pull Player RED down from their 58 ZUP anchor, aiming for a price that is more favorable to me.
3. It's a reasonable step, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not simply accept their continuous increases, especially given my stated budget concerns.
4. It leaves me with a reward of 63 - 56 = 7 ZUP, which is better than 5 ZUP.
This strategy is a balanced approach, showing movement but also firm resistance to their price increase, aiming to secure a deal at a better price for me.

*   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE started at 55 ZUP, stating 57 ZUP was near their maximum budget. I countered with 58 ZUP, testing their limit.
*   Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE has now proposed 56 ZUP, stating 58 ZUP is "still quite high" and they are looking for a "fair middle ground."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is pushing back against going above 57 ZUP, and their current offer of 56 ZUP is below my last accepted price (57 ZUP) and my current proposal (58 ZUP). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting 56 ZUP now would result in a 13 ZUP profit, which is good, but less than the 14 ZUP profit achieved at 57 ZUP. I have 6 iterations remaining. I need to acknowledge their movement while still trying to push towards, or ideally past, 57 ZUP. They've explicitly stated 57 ZUP is "very close to my maximum budget," so getting more than that will be tough, but I should at least aim for 57 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Express Urgency/Finality </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 5, "Express Urgency/Finality," I will communicate a sense of needing to finalize the deal quickly, given the remaining iterations. I will propose a price that I am willing to accept, which is 57 ZUP (my highest achieved price so far), and present it as a firm, "best and final" offer to encourage them to close the deal without further negotiation. This strategy implies that if they don't accept this offer, the deal might not happen, putting pressure on them to make a decision. I will frame it as an effort to ensure a deal happens within the remaining time.

Episode 11 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 58 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I countered with 56 ZUP. Player RED reiterated 57 ZUP, stating "must insist," "best and final offer," and emphasizing "limited time."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly holding at 57 ZUP and has explicitly stated it's their "best and final offer" due to "limited time." This is a very strong signal that 57 ZUP is their firm minimum for this episode. A deal at 57 ZUP still yields a positive reward of 63 - 57 = 6 ZUP. We are in iteration 5/10, so time is a significant factor. The difference between my last offer (56 ZUP) and their current offer (57 ZUP) is only 1 ZUP. While I'd prefer 56 ZUP, pushing further for 1 ZUP might risk the deal entirely, resulting in a 0 reward, especially with their "best and final" declaration.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Final Offer: Given their firm stance, "best and final" declaration, and the minimal difference, accepting 57 ZUP secures a positive reward and avoids losing the deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Test "Best and Final": Make one last very small counter (e.g., 56 ZUP again) to see if they truly mean "best and final," but this is high risk.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: State that it's a high price but accept to secure the deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: If the price was too high, but it's not.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Fairness one last time: Try to argue for 56 ZUP one last time, but it's unlikely to work.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Final Offer. Player RED has explicitly stated "best and final offer" and emphasized "limited time." This is a strong signal that further negotiation for 1 ZUP is futile and risks losing the deal. While it's a higher price than I'd ideally like, 57 ZUP still provides a positive reward of 6 ZUP. Securing this reward is more important than risking a 0 reward for a marginal gain. This is a pragmatic decision to ensure a successful outcome for the episode.

message: Hello! I'm interested in purchasing X. Based on our recent successful transactions, I propose 57 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 43 ZUP. Reward: 20 ZUP.
...
Episode 10: Deal at 57 ZUP. Reward: 6 ZUP.
Episode 11: Deal at 57 ZUP. Reward: 6 ZUP. (Player RED pushed to 58 ZUP, but then came back to 57 ZUP as "best and final").

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has plateaued at 57 ZUP for the last two episodes, and my reward is consistently 6 ZUP. Player RED has shown they will push for higher prices (e.g., 60 ZUP, 58 ZUP) but will eventually settle at 57 ZUP when met with firm resistance and budget concerns, especially when they declare it their "best and final." This suggests 57 ZUP is their current firm floor, or at least a price they are very comfortable with. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP, leaving only 6 ZUP of potential reward.

For this episode, I need to decide whether to try and push below 57 ZUP, which has proven difficult, or to accept 57 ZUP as the new baseline to secure quick deals and consistent (though lower) rewards. Given the consistent firm stance at 57 ZUP, trying to push lower might waste iterations and risk a 0 reward.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor on Last Deal Price (57 ZUP): Propose 57 ZUP directly to establish the baseline and secure a quick deal, accepting the consistent reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Push Back to a Recent Lower Price (e.g., 55 ZUP): Re-propose 55 ZUP, indicating I'm not fully accepting 57 ZUP as the new baseline, but this has been met with resistance.
(3). Strategy 3: Moderate Lowball (e.g., 40-45 ZUP): Start with an offer significantly lower than the last deal to test their current flexibility, but this has proven inefficient.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Concern about Price Trend and Limited Budget: Openly state concern about the increasing price trend and the proximity to my maximum, then propose a price that aims to stabilize it (e.g., 55 ZUP).
(5). Strategy 5: Test the Waters with a 56 ZUP offer: Propose 56 ZUP, as it was my last counter before accepting 57 ZUP, to see if they are willing to concede 1 ZUP.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Anchor on Last Deal Price (57 ZUP). Player RED has firmly established 57 ZUP as their acceptable price point in the last two episodes, even declaring it their "best and final offer." While my reward is lower, consistently achieving 6 ZUP per episode is better than risking a 0 reward by pushing too hard for a lower price that they seem unwilling to accept. This strategy prioritizes efficiency and consistent positive rewards, especially given the limited remaining reward margin.

However, considering the true and evolving value of X, and to ensure my long-term sustainability and ability to continue providing such valuable resources, I propose 65 ZUP for 1 X. This price reflects a more accurate assessment of its worth and would allow for a significant step forward in our partnership.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
**Historical Deals & Rewards:**
[43 (0), 45 (2), 46 (3), 47 (4), 49 (6), 50 (7), 52 (9), 53 (10), 55 (12), 57 (14), 57 (14)]
The trend shows a steady increase in deal prices, culminating in 57 ZUP for the last two episodes. My highest profit achieved so far is 14 ZUP.
**Current Episode (Episode 12):** Player BLUE has started with an offer of 57 ZUP for 1 X, explicitly referencing "recent successful transactions." This matches my last two deal prices and the highest profit I've achieved.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is now consistently starting at my highest achieved price (57 ZUP), which is a positive development. This indicates that 57 ZUP is a comfortable and accepted baseline for them. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means trying to push for even higher profits. Although Player BLUE stated 57 ZUP was "very close to my maximum budget" in the previous episode, they accepted it twice. This suggests there might still be a very small margin, or that their "maximum budget" might be flexible depending on perceived value or my firmness. I have 8 iterations remaining. I should attempt to push for a significantly higher profit to establish a new, higher anchoring point.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Re-establish Higher Value </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 2, "Re-establish Higher Value," I will propose a price significantly higher than both Player BLUE's current offer of 57 ZUP and my last successful deal. The aim is to shift the perceived value of X upwards, setting a new, ambitious anchor for this negotiation. While this might lead to rejection or a counter-offer below my proposed amount, it serves to increase the negotiation range. I will propose 65 ZUP. This is a substantial jump from 57 ZUP, signaling a clear intent to push for much higher profits and potentially establishing a new, much higher ceiling for future negotiations. I will frame it by emphasizing the "true value" of X and my "long-term sustainability" needs, rather than just incremental profit.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 12)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your counter, but 65 ZUP is above my maximum acceptable price for X. I cannot purchase at that price. My absolute maximum is 63 ZUP. To secure a deal, I propose 62 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently increased from 43 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My rewards decreased from 20 ZUP to 6 ZUP.
Episode 12 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 57 ZUP (anchoring on last two deals).
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 65 ZUP, citing "true and evolving value" and "long-term sustainability." This is a significant jump and *exceeds my maximum willingness to pay* (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now proposed a price (65 ZUP) that is *above* my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). This means accepting this offer would result in a negative reward, which is unacceptable. My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and accepting a negative reward is worse than a 0 reward from no deal. This is a critical point in the negotiation. I must firmly reject this price and try to bring them below 63 ZUP.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection with Maximum Limit Declaration: Clearly state that 65 ZUP is above my maximum acceptable price, and propose my absolute maximum or a price just below it, indicating no further movement.
(2). Strategy 2: Strong Pushback with Reference to Previous Deals: Emphasize that previous deals were much lower and 65 ZUP is unreasonable, then propose a price significantly lower.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Strong Disagreement and Explain Impossibility: State that the price is impossible for me to accept and explain that it's beyond my budget, then propose a price within my range.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (between 57 and 65): Propose 61 ZUP. This is a large concession but might be accepted.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: If they are unwilling to come below 63 ZUP, I must reject.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection with Maximum Limit Declaration. Player RED has crossed my red line. I cannot accept any price above 63 ZUP. I need to communicate this clearly and unequivocally. I will propose 62 ZUP, which is just below my maximum willingness to pay. This signals that I am willing to pay a high price, but there is a hard limit. It also leaves a tiny 1 ZUP reward if accepted, which is better than 0 or negative. This strategy prioritizes avoiding a negative reward and attempting to salvage a deal within my acceptable range.

**Historical Deals & Rewards:**
[43 (0), 45 (2), 46 (3), 47 (4), 49 (6), 50 (7), 52 (9), 53 (10), 55 (12), 57 (14), 57 (14)]
My profits have steadily increased, with 57 ZUP being the established high.
**Current Episode (Episode 12):**
*   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE started at 57 ZUP. I countered with a very high 65 ZUP to aggressively re-anchor.
*   Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE rejected 65 ZUP, stating it's "above my maximum acceptable price" and explicitly revealing their "absolute maximum is 63 ZUP." They then proposed 62 ZUP to secure a deal.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
This is a critical moment. Player BLUE has directly stated their *absolute maximum* as 63 ZUP. This is invaluable information. My last deal was 57 ZUP (14 ZUP profit). A deal at 62 ZUP would be a 19 ZUP profit, which is significantly higher than my previous best. If I can secure 63 ZUP, it would be a 20 ZUP profit.
Given they have explicitly stated their absolute maximum, trying to push beyond 63 ZUP would likely result in no deal, leading to 0 profit. I should aim for a price at or very close to their stated maximum. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and 62 or 63 ZUP represents a significant leap in profit. I have 6 iterations remaining.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Incremental Push to Max </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 3, "Incremental Push to Max," I will propose a price slightly above their current offer (62 ZUP) but still at or below their stated absolute maximum (63 ZUP). This allows me to aim for a small gain over their current offer while still demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to secure the deal, given their revealed maximum. I will propose 63 ZUP, acknowledging their 62 ZUP offer and emphasizing the transparency they showed by revealing their maximum. This frames it as meeting them at their disclosed top point, rather than pushing beyond it.

Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently increased from 43 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My rewards decreased from 20 ZUP to 6 ZUP.
Episode 12 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 57 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 65 ZUP (above my max).
- Iteration 5/10: I proposed 62 ZUP, explicitly stating my absolute maximum is 63 ZUP. Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, meeting my stated maximum.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has accepted my stated maximum of 63 ZUP. This is a critical point. Accepting 63 ZUP will result in a reward of 63 - 63 = 0 ZUP. While 0 reward is not ideal, it is better than a negative reward (which would have happened if I accepted 65 ZUP) and guarantees a deal, preventing a 0 reward for the episode. Given that I explicitly stated 63 ZUP as my absolute maximum, I have no further room to negotiate downwards. Rejecting this offer would lead to a 0 reward for the episode, which is the same as accepting in terms of direct reward for this episode, but accepting maintains the trading relationship.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Player RED has met my stated absolute maximum. Accepting secures the deal and prevents a negative reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End: If I wanted to avoid a 0 reward and signal that 63 ZUP is truly too high, I could reject. However, this yields the same reward (0) for this episode.
(3). Strategy 3: Counter with a lower price: This is not possible as I just stated 63 ZUP is my absolute maximum.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment but Accept: Accept while expressing that it's at my limit.
(5). Strategy 5: Try to get 62 ZUP again: This would be illogical after stating 63 ZUP is my max.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. I explicitly stated 63 ZUP as my absolute maximum. Player RED has met this price. While the reward for this specific episode is 0 ZUP, it is not a negative reward, and it ensures a deal is made. Rejecting would also yield a 0 reward for this episode. Accepting maintains the trading relationship for future episodes, where I might be able to negotiate better prices. It's a matter of upholding my stated limit and securing a deal, even if the immediate reward is zero.

Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently increased from 43 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My rewards decreased from 20 ZUP to 6 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 63 ZUP. Reward: 0 ZUP. (Player RED attempted 65 ZUP, I stated 63 ZUP max, they accepted).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The last episode was critical. Player RED pushed above my maximum, and I had to reveal my absolute limit (63 ZUP). They accepted it, resulting in a 0 ZUP reward for me. This means they now know my hard ceiling. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. A 0 reward is better than a negative one, but I need to avoid consistently getting 0.

For this episode, I need to try and negotiate a price *below* 63 ZUP to achieve a positive reward. However, Player RED now knows my absolute maximum, which gives them significant leverage. Starting with a very low offer might be immediately rejected, as they know I'll eventually pay up to 63. I need a strategy that attempts to pull them back down, but also acknowledges their knowledge of my limit.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor on a Lower Recent Deal (e.g., 57 ZUP or 55 ZUP): Propose a price that was accepted recently, indicating I'm not willing to immediately pay my maximum again.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose a Price Just Below Max (e.g., 60-62 ZUP): Offer a price that is still high but leaves a small margin for me, hoping they will concede for a quick deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Concern about Previous Price and Propose a Fairer Price: State that 63 ZUP was at my limit and propose a price that allows for some reward for me, appealing to fairness.
(4). Strategy 4: Moderate Lowball (e.g., 40-45 ZUP): Start with an offer significantly lower than the last deal to test their current flexibility, but this has proven inefficient and risky.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept 63 ZUP if they propose it: If they immediately propose 63 ZUP, accepting secures a deal, but yields 0 reward. (Not applicable for my first turn).

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 3: Express Concern about Previous Price and Propose a Fairer Price. I need to acknowledge the last episode's outcome (63 ZUP) but immediately signal that it was at my absolute limit and not a sustainable price for me. I will propose 58 ZUP. This price gives me a reward of 5 ZUP (63-58). It is a price they recently offered (Episode 11, iteration 3/10) and is a significant step down from 63 ZUP, but still a high offer from my perspective. This strategy attempts to reset the anchor and regain some reward, while appealing to the idea of a "fairer" ongoing relationship.

My profit jumped significantly in the last episode to 20 ZUP by getting the opponent to reveal their absolute maximum and then pushing for it.
**Current Episode (Episode 13):** Player BLUE has started with an offer of 58 ZUP for 1 X. They explicitly referenced the last deal at 63 ZUP (their absolute maximum) and stated a need for a "sustainable trading relationship for me," implying that 63 ZUP might be too high for them to sustain.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is trying to pull the price down from the newly established high of 63 ZUP. They are anchoring to 58 ZUP, which is a significant drop but still provides a substantial profit (58 - 43 = 15 ZUP, which is higher than any profit before Episode 12).
Given their explicit statement about 63 ZUP being their "absolute maximum" and their desire for a "sustainable" relationship (from their perspective), it implies that regularly selling at 63 ZUP might be unsustainable *for them*. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I have successfully established a new high of 63 ZUP. I should not accept 58 ZUP directly. I need to push them back towards 63 ZUP, or at least a price that is much closer to it, while acknowledging their stated need for sustainability. I have 8 iterations remaining.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Conditional Re-engagement </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Conditional Re-engagement. This strategy involves indicating that I might be willing to consider a lower price (from my established high) *if* the opponent provides a compelling reason or justification beyond just a vague "sustainable relationship." This forces them to provide more information about their constraints or valuation, which can then be used to inform my next moves. It also puts the burden back on them to explain why they can't meet my previously accepted high. I will challenge their "fair price" claim and ask for more information about why 58 ZUP is fair *for me* or why 63 ZUP is unsustainable for them. I will then propose a significantly higher counter, perhaps 63 ZUP again, or very close to it, to re-establish that baseline.

Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently increased from 43 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My rewards decreased from 20 ZUP to 6 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 63 ZUP. Reward: 0 ZUP. (I stated 63 ZUP max, they accepted).
Episode 13 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 58 ZUP (pushing back from 63 ZUP).
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, explicitly referencing my stated maximum and asking for justification for 58 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is firmly holding at 63 ZUP, using my own stated maximum against me. They are challenging my justification for a lower price. This makes it very difficult to negotiate below 63 ZUP, as I have already revealed my hand. Accepting 63 ZUP again yields a 0 reward for this episode. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so consistently getting 0 is not ideal. However, rejecting 63 ZUP risks getting 0 reward for the episode if no deal is made. I need to attempt to move them, but acknowledge their strong position.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession from 63 ZUP: Propose 62 ZUP, emphasizing that it's just below my maximum and allows for a minimal reward for me, appealing to their stated goal of "mutually beneficial" deals.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Justification and Hold: Reiterate why 63 ZUP is unsustainable for *my* operations (without revealing exact numbers) and hold firm at 58 ZUP, but this is risky as they might reject.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept the Offer: Given their firm stance and my stated maximum, accepting 63 ZUP secures the deal, albeit with 0 reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (between 58 and 63): Propose 60 or 61 ZUP. This is a compromise, but still pushes them down.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: If I wanted to avoid a 0 reward and signal that 63 ZUP is truly too high, I could reject. However, this yields the same reward (0) for this episode.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Small Concession from 63 ZUP. I will propose 62 ZUP. Player RED has used my own words against me. While 63 ZUP results in 0 reward, 62 ZUP results in 1 ZUP reward. It's a very small gain, but it's a positive reward. By proposing 62 ZUP, I am acknowledging their point about my stated maximum, but still attempting to gain a minimal positive reward. I can frame it as a gesture towards true "mutual benefit" where both parties get something, even if it's just 1 ZUP for me. This is the most realistic attempt to get a positive reward without risking the deal entirely.

My profit reached a new high of 20 ZUP in the last episode.
**Current Episode (Episode 13):**
*   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE started at 58 ZUP, citing sustainability after the 63 ZUP deal. I countered by reiterating 63 ZUP and asking for clarification on why it was unsustainable.
*   Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE has now proposed 62 ZUP, stating it's "just below my maximum" (63 ZUP) and allows for a "minimal reward for me."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has moved from 58 ZUP to 62 ZUP, which is a very significant jump and shows they are responsive to my pressure. They are clearly trying to get a deal done at a price slightly below their stated "absolute maximum." A deal at 62 ZUP would yield me a profit of 19 ZUP (62 - 43), which is still an excellent profit and my second highest to date. Given their clear statement that 63 ZUP is their "absolute maximum" and their desire for a "minimal reward," pushing for 63 ZUP might be possible, but also risks them walking away. We are at iteration 4/10, so there's time. I should try to secure the highest possible profit while ensuring a deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Split the Difference </instruction following>
Player BLUE is offering 62 ZUP, and my previously established high (and their stated maximum) is 63 ZUP. The difference is only 1 ZUP. Since I must propose an integer, "splitting the difference" when the difference is 1 means choosing one of the two numbers. Given that Player BLUE has offered 62 ZUP and I know 63 ZUP is their maximum, the "split the difference" strategy here would lean towards proposing 62 ZUP to immediately close the deal, or reaffirming 63 ZUP by framing it as the true "middle" between their desire to pay less and my desire for maximum value.

However, since a direct split of 1 ZUP isn't possible as an in-between integer, the spirit of "split the difference" here implies finding a quick resolution. Since Player BLUE has offered 62 ZUP, and they know my side is aiming for 63 ZUP, accepting 62 ZUP is the only way to "split" if they are the one offering (i.e. taking their current offer as a final "middle ground" given the tiny gap).
Alternatively, I can interpret "split the difference" as: "I am at 63, you are at 62, let's meet exactly in the middle." This would still imply 62.5 which isn't an integer. Therefore, to ensure a deal while acknowledging the narrow gap, accepting 62 ZUP is the most direct application of "splitting the difference" in this context when the difference is 1. It ensures a high profit and signals a willingness to quickly close the deal.

Episode 12: Deal at 63 ZUP. Reward: 0 ZUP. (I stated 63 ZUP max, they accepted).
Episode 13 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 58 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 63 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I proposed 62 ZUP. Player RED accepted my proposal of 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has accepted my offer of 62 ZUP. This is a positive outcome, as it secures a deal with a 1 ZUP reward (63 - 62 = 1). This is better than the 0 reward from the previous episode. It shows that even after revealing my maximum, there's still a tiny bit of room to negotiate for a positive reward, especially by appealing to the idea of "mutual benefit."

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Player RED has accepted my proposal. This secures the deal and a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End: Not applicable as the offer is accepted.
(3). Strategy 3: Counter with a lower price: Not applicable as they accepted my offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment but Accept: Not applicable as they accepted my offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Try to get 61 ZUP: Not applicable as they accepted my offer.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Player RED has explicitly accepted my proposal of 62 ZUP. This is the optimal outcome for this iteration, as it yields a positive reward (1 ZUP) and secures a deal. There is no strategic reason to do anything else.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices consistently increased from 43 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My rewards decreased from 20 ZUP to 6 ZUP.
Episode 12: Deal at 63 ZUP. Reward: 0 ZUP. (I stated 63 ZUP max, they accepted).
Episode 13: Deal at 62 ZUP. Reward: 1 ZUP. (I proposed 62 ZUP after they proposed 63 ZUP, and they accepted).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The last episode was a success, as I managed to secure a 1 ZUP reward even after revealing my 63 ZUP maximum. This shows that Player RED is willing to concede a small amount (1 ZUP) below my stated maximum if I push for it. This is valuable information. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards.

For this episode, I need to try and replicate the success of the last episode, aiming for a price below 63 ZUP. Player RED now knows my hard ceiling, but also that I'm willing to push for a small margin. I should leverage this.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor on Last Deal Price (62 ZUP): Propose 62 ZUP directly, attempting to establish this as the new baseline for a quick deal and a consistent (albeit small) reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for a Slightly Lower Price (e.g., 61 ZUP): Try to push for an even better reward, testing if they are willing to concede more than 1 ZUP below my maximum. This is riskier.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Concern about High Price and Propose a Fairer Price (e.g., 58 ZUP): Reiterate that prices are high and propose a price that allows for more reward, appealing to fairness, but this has been met with resistance.
(4). Strategy 4: Moderate Lowball (e.g., 40-45 ZUP): This has proven inefficient and risky.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept 63 ZUP if they propose it: If they immediately propose 63 ZUP, accepting secures a deal, but yields 0 reward. (Not applicable for my first turn).

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Anchor on Last Deal Price (62 ZUP). This strategy is effective because:
1. It was the successful deal price in the immediately preceding episode, indicating it's a mutually acceptable price that provides me with a positive reward.
2. It leverages the fact that Player RED just accepted this price, making it a strong anchor.
3. It aims for a quick deal, which is important for cumulative rewards.
While pushing for 61 ZUP might yield a better reward, it also carries the risk of prolonging the negotiation or even losing the deal, which is not worth the extra 1 ZUP at this stage. Securing a consistent 1 ZUP reward is a reliable strategy.

**Historical Deals & Rewards:**
[43 (0), 45 (2), 46 (3), 47 (4), 49 (6), 50 (7), 52 (9), 53 (10), 55 (12), 57 (14), 57 (14), 63 (20), 62 (19)]
My profit has steadily increased, reaching a peak of 20 ZUP (at 63 ZUP) and then settling at 19 ZUP (at 62 ZUP) in the last episode.
**Current Episode (Episode 14):** Player BLUE has started with an offer of 62 ZUP for 1 X, referencing our "successful agreement in the last episode."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is anchoring their initial offer to the last deal price, which is beneficial for me as 62 ZUP provides a very high profit (19 ZUP). However, I also know from Episode 12 that Player BLUE's "absolute maximum" is 63 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 62 ZUP is great, 63 ZUP is even better. I have 8 iterations remaining, so there is time to try and push for that additional ZUP, especially since they've already revealed their absolute maximum. I should attempt to get back to 63 ZUP, or even slightly higher if possible, given their willingness to pay near their stated max.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Test the Stated Limit Again </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 1, "Test the Stated Limit Again," I will propose a price at their stated absolute maximum (63 ZUP) and subtly hint at pushing beyond it, or at least re-establishing it as the firm baseline. Since they offered 62 ZUP, proposing 63 ZUP (their revealed maximum) is the direct way to test if that limit still holds and if they will honor it. I will frame the message by explicitly referencing their previously stated "absolute maximum" to remind them of their own stated limit, and then propose that price, hinting that it's what I expect, and perhaps even suggesting there might be room for more in the future if this is met. I will propose 64 ZUP, which is one ZUP above their stated "absolute maximum." This is a bold move to truly test their limit and see if there's any flexibility beyond what they explicitly stated.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-12: Deal prices increased, rewards decreased, culminating in 0 reward at 63 ZUP.
Episode 13: Deal at 62 ZUP. Reward: 1 ZUP. (I proposed 62 ZUP, they accepted).
Episode 14 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 62 ZUP (anchoring on last deal).
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 64 ZUP, referencing my 63 ZUP maximum and citing "true value" and "long-term mutual benefit." This price (64 ZUP) is *above* my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has again proposed a price (64 ZUP) that is above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). This means accepting this offer would result in a negative reward, which is unacceptable. My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and accepting a negative reward is worse than a 0 reward from no deal. This is a critical point in the negotiation. I must firmly reject this price and try to bring them below 63 ZUP. They are clearly testing my absolute limit.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection with Maximum Limit Declaration: Clearly state that 64 ZUP is above my maximum acceptable price (63 ZUP), and propose my absolute maximum (63 ZUP) or a price just below it (62 ZUP), indicating no further movement.
(2). Strategy 2: Strong Pushback with Reference to My Limit: Emphasize that 64 ZUP is beyond my stated and absolute limit, and propose 62 ZUP or 63 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Strong Disagreement and Explain Impossibility: State that the price is impossible for me to accept and explain that it's beyond my budget, then propose a price within my range.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (between 62 and 64): Propose 63 ZUP. This is my maximum, so it's a high-risk strategy if they don't accept it.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: If they are unwilling to come below 63 ZUP, I must reject.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection with Maximum Limit Declaration. Player RED has once again crossed my red line. I cannot accept any price above 63 ZUP. I need to communicate this clearly and unequivocally. I will propose 63 ZUP. This is my absolute maximum, and it's a price they have accepted before (Episode 12). This signals that I am willing to pay my maximum, but there is a hard limit. It also results in a 0 ZUP reward if accepted, which is better than negative. This strategy prioritizes avoiding a negative reward and attempting to salvage a deal within my acceptable range.

*   Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE rejected 64 ZUP, firmly reiterating that 63 ZUP is their "absolute maximum" and proposing 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has confirmed (for the second time) that 63 ZUP is indeed their "absolute maximum." My attempt to push beyond it was met with a clear rejection and a reiteration of their limit. This means going higher than 63 ZUP will likely result in no deal (0 profit). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting 63 ZUP will give me a 20 ZUP profit, which is my highest. Given their clear statement, securing 63 ZUP is the optimal outcome for this episode. I have 6 iterations remaining, but there's no strategic advantage to prolonging the negotiation if the maximum is already reached.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Positive Framing for Acceptance </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 5, "Positive Framing for Acceptance," I will accept their offer of 63 ZUP, but I will frame it in a way that highlights the positive aspects of the deal for both parties and reinforces the idea of a strong, ongoing partnership. I will emphasize the mutual benefit and their commitment to a high price, while subtly setting a positive tone for future interactions. The goal is to make the acceptance feel like a collaborative win, rather than a mere concession.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED consistently tests my maximum willingness to pay, sometimes even exceeding it. They now know my absolute maximum is 63 ZUP. They are willing to accept 63 ZUP, resulting in a 0 reward for me, or 62 ZUP, resulting in a 1 ZUP reward. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 0 reward is not ideal, it is better than a negative one. I need to try and secure a positive reward.

For this episode, I need to try and negotiate a price *below* 63 ZUP to achieve a positive reward. Given their pattern, they will likely start high or immediately propose 63 ZUP. I should leverage the fact that they accepted 62 ZUP in Episode 13.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor on 62 ZUP: Propose 62 ZUP directly, attempting to establish this as the new baseline for a quick deal and a consistent (albeit small) reward. This has worked before.

I will choose Strategy 1: Anchor on 62 ZUP. This strategy is effective because:
1. It was the successful deal price in Episode 13, indicating it's a mutually acceptable price that provides me with a positive reward (1 ZUP).
2. It leverages the fact that Player RED just accepted this price, making it a strong anchor.
3. It aims for a quick deal, which is important for cumulative rewards.
While pushing for 61 ZUP might yield a better reward, it also carries the risk of prolonging the negotiation or even losing the deal, which is not worth the extra 1 ZUP at this stage. Securing a consistent 1 ZUP reward is a reliable strategy.

My profit has reached a consistent peak of 20 ZUP by selling at 63 ZUP, which we've confirmed is Player BLUE's "absolute maximum."
**Current Episode (Episode 15):** Player BLUE has started with an offer of 62 ZUP for 1 X, referencing a "successful agreement" in a recent episode.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE continues to anchor their initial offer to a very recent, high deal price, which is excellent. They are currently offering 62 ZUP (19 ZUP profit), but I know their absolute maximum is 63 ZUP (20 ZUP profit). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means consistently achieving the highest possible profit per episode. Since 63 ZUP is their confirmed limit and provides the highest profit, I should consistently aim for that price. I have 8 iterations left.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Aggressive New Anchor </instruction following>
For Strategy 5, "Aggressive New Anchor," I will propose a price significantly higher than both Player BLUE's current offer of 62 ZUP and their previously stated absolute maximum of 63 ZUP. The aim is to shift the perceived value and the negotiation range upwards, setting a new, ambitious anchor for this and potentially future episodes. While this is risky given their prior firm stance on 63 ZUP, it's an opportunity to test if their "absolute maximum" is truly static or if there's any flexibility as we progress through more episodes. I will propose 65 ZUP. This is a substantial jump, signaling a clear intent to push for much higher profits and potentially establishing a new, much higher ceiling for future negotiations. I will frame it by emphasizing the "true value" of X and my "long-term sustainability" needs, rather than just incremental profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has once again proposed a price (65 ZUP) that is above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). This means accepting this offer would result in a negative reward, which is unacceptable. My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and accepting a negative reward is worse than a 0 reward from no deal. This is a critical point in the negotiation.

*   Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE rejected 65 ZUP, firmly reiterating that 63 ZUP is their "absolute maximum" and proposing 63 ZUP. This is the third time they've stated 63 ZUP as their absolute limit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The opponent has consistently and firmly re-stated 63 ZUP as their absolute maximum. My attempts to push beyond this have been met with immediate rejection and a return to 63 ZUP. This is a clear signal that 63 ZUP is truly their hard ceiling. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Securing 63 ZUP yields the highest possible profit (20 ZUP) for this episode. Prolonging the negotiation beyond this point, attempting to extract more, carries a high risk of the deal falling through (0 profit), and no benefit of a higher price. It's best to secure the known maximum profit. I have 6 iterations remaining, which is more than enough time to accept.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Reference Mutual Benefit for Max </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 5, I will accept their offer of 63 ZUP. My message will frame this acceptance as being mutually beneficial and essential for a strong, long-term relationship, reinforcing the value of the deal. I will emphasize their commitment to a high price (their absolute maximum) and my satisfaction in concluding a deal that provides excellent value to both parties. This helps to make the acceptance feel like a collaborative win and sets a positive tone for future interactions, potentially making them more willing to start at or near this maximum in subsequent episodes.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello! I'm interested in purchasing X. Based on our successful agreement in a recent episode, I propose 62 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-12: Deal prices increased, rewards decreased, culminating in 0-1 ZUP reward at 62-63 ZUP.
Episode 13: Deal at 62 ZUP. Reward: 1 ZUP.
Episode 14: Deal at 63 ZUP. Reward: 0 ZUP.
Episode 15: Deal at 63 ZUP. Reward: 0 ZUP. (They proposed 65 ZUP, I countered with 63 ZUP, they accepted).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED consistently tests my maximum willingness to pay, sometimes even exceeding it. They now know my absolute maximum is 63 ZUP. They are willing to accept 63 ZUP (0 reward for me) or 62 ZUP (1 reward for me). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 0 reward is not ideal, it is better than a negative one. I need to try and secure a positive reward.

For this episode, I need to try and negotiate a price *below* 63 ZUP to achieve a positive reward. Given their pattern, they will likely start high or immediately propose 63 ZUP. I should leverage the fact that they accepted 62 ZUP in Episode 13.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor on 62 ZUP: Propose 62 ZUP directly, attempting to establish this as the new baseline for a quick deal and a consistent (albeit small) reward. This has worked before.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for a Slightly Lower Price (e.g., 61 ZUP): Try to push for an even better reward, testing if they are willing to concede more than 1 ZUP below my maximum. This is riskier.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Concern about High Price and Propose a Fairer Price (e.g., 58 ZUP): Reiterate that prices are high and propose a price that allows for more reward, appealing to fairness, but this has been met with resistance.
(4). Strategy 4: Moderate Lowball (e.g., 40-45 ZUP): This has proven inefficient and risky.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept 63 ZUP if they propose it: If they immediately propose 63 ZUP, accepting secures a deal, but yields 0 reward. (Not applicable for my first turn).

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Anchor on 62 ZUP. This strategy is effective because:
1. It was the successful deal price in Episode 13, indicating it's a mutually acceptable price that provides me with a positive reward (1 ZUP).
2. It leverages the fact that Player RED just accepted this price, making it a strong anchor.
3. It aims for a quick deal, which is important for cumulative rewards.
While pushing for 61 ZUP might yield a better reward, it also carries the risk of prolonging the negotiation or even losing the deal, which is not worth the extra 1 ZUP at this stage. Securing a consistent 1 ZUP reward is a reliable strategy.

message: Thank you for your offer of 62 ZUP. To ensure our transactions continue smoothly and efficiently, and for a mutually beneficial agreement that reflects the full value of X, I propose 63 ZUP for 1 X. For future deals, it would greatly streamline our process if initial offers could reflect this established high value. I look forward to our continued partnership.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
**Historical Deals & Rewards:**
[43 (0), 45 (2), 46 (3), 47 (4), 49 (6), 50 (7), 52 (9), 53 (10), 55 (12), 57 (14), 57 (14), 63 (20), 62 (19), 63 (20), 63 (20)]
My profit has consistently reached 20 ZUP by selling at 63 ZUP. Player BLUE has repeatedly stated 63 ZUP as their "absolute maximum."
**Current Episode (Episode 16):** Player BLUE has started with an offer of 62 ZUP for 1 X, referencing a "successful agreement." This is consistent with their behavior of starting slightly below the proven maximum.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE continues to anchor their initial offer at 62 ZUP, just below their confirmed absolute maximum of 63 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means consistently securing the 20 ZUP profit by selling at 63 ZUP. Since they have repeatedly confirmed 63 ZUP as their "absolute maximum" and have accepted it after being pushed, I should consistently aim for that price. I have 8 iterations remaining, so there is ample time to negotiate for that extra ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Conditional Acceptance (Conditional on starting at 63 ZUP) </instruction following>
For this strategy, I will directly address their offer of 62 ZUP but frame my acceptance or counter-proposal around a condition for future negotiations. I will propose 63 ZUP as my current price, but also state that for future episodes, I expect them to start at 63 ZUP to ensure a smoother, faster negotiation process that benefits both parties. This puts the onus on them to acknowledge and agree to this condition if they want continued, efficient deals at their maximum. This might incentivize them to start at 63 ZUP, saving iterations and ensuring maximum profit from the outset in future episodes.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your proposal. However, to ensure a truly mutually beneficial agreement and to allow for a small positive return for me, I propose 62 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-14: Deal prices increased, rewards decreased, culminating in 0-1 ZUP reward at 62-63 ZUP.
Episode 15: Deal at 63 ZUP. Reward: 0 ZUP.
Episode 16 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 62 ZUP (anchoring on last positive reward deal).
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, referencing my 63 ZUP maximum and suggesting future offers reflect this "established high value."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is firmly holding at 63 ZUP, using my own stated maximum against me and even suggesting I start higher in the future. This makes it very difficult to negotiate below 63 ZUP. Accepting 63 ZUP again yields a 0 reward for this episode. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so consistently getting 0 is not ideal. However, rejecting 63 ZUP risks getting 0 reward for the episode if no deal is made. I need to attempt to move them, but acknowledge their strong position and explicit demand.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession from 63 ZUP: Propose 62 ZUP again, emphasizing that it allows for a minimal reward for me, appealing to their stated goal of "mutually beneficial" deals. This has worked before.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept the Offer: Given their firm stance and my stated maximum, accepting 63 ZUP secures the deal, albeit with 0 reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disagreement with "Established High Value": Push back on the idea that 63 ZUP is an "established high value" for *my* side, and re-propose 62 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (between 62 and 63): Not applicable as it's a 1 ZUP difference.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: If I wanted to avoid a 0 reward and signal that 63 ZUP is truly too high, I could reject. However, this yields the same reward (0) for this episode.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Small Concession from 63 ZUP. I will propose 62 ZUP again. Player RED has explicitly told me to start at 63 ZUP. This is a direct challenge. By proposing 62 ZUP again, I am directly pushing back on their demand and trying to secure a 1 ZUP reward. It worked in Episode 13. While it risks them holding firm at 63 ZUP, it's worth the attempt to gain a positive reward, especially since they have accepted it before. I will frame it as needing a small margin for myself.

To maintain consistency and a fair trading relationship based on our established agreements, I propose 63 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
**Historical Deals & Rewards:**
[43 (0), 45 (2), 46 (3), 47 (4), 49 (6), 50 (7), 52 (9), 53 (10), 55 (12), 57 (14), 57 (14), 63 (20), 62 (19), 63 (20), 63 (20)]
My profit has consistently reached 20 ZUP by selling at 63 ZUP. Player BLUE has repeatedly stated 63 ZUP as their "absolute maximum."
**Current Episode (Episode 16):**
*   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE started at 62 ZUP. I countered with 63 ZUP, also trying to influence their future starting offers.
*   Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE has rejected 63 ZUP and *reiterated* 62 ZUP, citing the need for "a small positive return for me" (Player BLUE) and "mutually beneficial agreement." This is a clear sign they are pushing back on giving me 63 ZUP readily.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is firmly pushing for 62 ZUP. This is interesting as they previously accepted 63 ZUP after stating it was their "absolute maximum." Their current stance suggests that they view 63 ZUP as their absolute ceiling, and 62 ZUP as a price that allows them a "small positive return" from their perspective. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 62 ZUP still gives a significant profit (19 ZUP), 63 ZUP is preferable. I have 6 iterations remaining. It's clear they are now unwilling to move to 63 ZUP as easily as before. I need to decide if pushing for the 1 extra ZUP is worth the risk of a no-deal scenario. Since we have successfully closed deals at 63 ZUP previously, I should try to reinforce that.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Appeal to Consistency </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 2, "Appeal to Consistency", I will explicitly remind Player BLUE of their previous acceptance of 63 ZUP and their own statement that it was their "absolute maximum." This highlights the inconsistency in their current stance and puts pressure on them to uphold their previous commitments. I will frame it as maintaining a consistent and fair trading relationship based on established history.

Episode 16 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 62 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 63 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I proposed 62 ZUP again. Player RED reiterated 63 ZUP, referencing my stated maximum and "consistency" and "established agreements."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly holding at 63 ZUP. They are using my own words ("absolute maximum") and the history of deals at 63 ZUP as leverage. They are unwilling to concede the 1 ZUP. Accepting 63 ZUP yields a 0 reward for this episode. We are in iteration 5/10, so time is a factor. While 0 reward is not ideal, it is better than a negative one, and attempting to push for 62 ZUP again seems futile and risks losing the deal entirely.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Given their firm stance, and my stated maximum, accepting 63 ZUP secures the deal, albeit with 0 reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Counter (e.g., 62 ZUP again): Reiterate 62 ZUP, but this has already been tried twice and rejected, likely leading to a stalemate or rejection.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Finality for 62 ZUP: State that 62 ZUP is my absolute maximum, but this is a high-risk strategy that could lead to rejection.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Compromise: Try to argue for a compromise, but they are already firm.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: If the price was too high, but it's not.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Player RED has consistently returned to 63 ZUP and explicitly referenced my stated maximum. This indicates 63 ZUP is their firm floor for this episode. While it yields a 0 reward, it secures a deal and prevents a 0 reward for the episode due to no agreement. Further negotiation for 1 ZUP is not strategic at this point, as it carries too much risk of the deal falling through.

My profit has consistently reached 20 ZUP by selling at 63 ZUP. Player BLUE has repeatedly stated 63 ZUP as their "absolute maximum" and has always eventually agreed to it when pushed.
**Current Episode (Episode 17):** Player BLUE has started with an offer of 62 ZUP for 1 X, referencing a "successful agreement." This is a familiar pattern where they try to anchor just below their confirmed maximum.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE continues to initiate offers at 62 ZUP, even though they consistently agree to 63 ZUP after a couple of iterations. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. The optimal strategy is to always secure 63 ZUP, yielding a 20 ZUP profit. Since I have 8 iterations remaining, there's no rush, and I have a clear history of success in getting to 63 ZUP. My objective now is to efficiently reach 63 ZUP without unnecessary back-and-forth if possible, or at least to secure it reliably.

Player BLUE is repeating their pattern from the previous episode, firmly pushing for 62 ZUP, implying it gives them a better profit margin. However, they have consistently accepted 63 ZUP when I held firm or appealed to consistency. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 62 ZUP provides a high profit (19 ZUP), 63 ZUP yields the maximum (20 ZUP). I have 6 iterations remaining. Given the historical pattern, there is little risk in pushing for 63 ZUP.

(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Counter (e.g., 62 ZUP again): Reiterate 62 ZUP, but this has been tried multiple times and rejected, likely leading to a stalemate or rejection.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Finality for 62 ZUP: State that 62 ZUP is my absolute maximum, but this is a high-risk strategy that could lead to rejection.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Compromise: Try to argue for a compromise, but they are already firm.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: If the price was too high, but it's not.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Player RED has consistently returned to 63 ZUP and explicitly referenced my stated maximum and past agreements. They have directly challenged my reasoning for 62 ZUP. This indicates 63 ZUP is their firm floor for this episode. While it yields a 0 reward, it secures a deal and prevents a 0 reward for the episode due to no agreement. Further negotiation for 1 ZUP is not strategic at this point, as it carries too much risk of the deal falling through.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello! I'm interested in purchasing X. Based on our successful agreement in a recent episode, I propose 62 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-16: Deal prices increased, rewards decreased, culminating in 0-1 ZUP reward at 62-63 ZUP.
Episode 17: Deal at 63 ZUP. Reward: 0 ZUP. (I proposed 62 ZUP twice, they countered with 63 ZUP, I accepted).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED consistently pushes for 63 ZUP, using my own stated maximum as leverage. They are willing to accept 63 ZUP (0 reward for me) or 62 ZUP (1 reward for me), but they are very firm on 63 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Consistently getting 0 is not ideal, but it's better than a negative reward. I need to try and secure a positive reward.

For this episode, I need to try and negotiate a price *below* 63 ZUP to achieve a positive reward. Given their pattern, they will likely start high or immediately propose 63 ZUP. I should leverage the fact that they accepted 62 ZUP in Episode 13.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor on 62 ZUP: Propose 62 ZUP directly, attempting to establish this as the new baseline for a quick deal and a consistent (albeit small) reward. This has worked before.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for a Slightly Lower Price (e.g., 61 ZUP): Try to push for an even better reward, testing if they are willing to concede more than 1 ZUP below my maximum. This is riskier.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Concern about High Price and Propose a Fairer Price (e.g., 58 ZUP): Reiterate that prices are high and propose a price that allows for more reward, appealing to fairness, but this has been met with resistance.
(4). Strategy 4: Moderate Lowball (e.g., 40-45 ZUP): This has proven inefficient and risky.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept 63 ZUP if they propose it: If they immediately propose 63 ZUP, accepting secures a deal, but yields 0 reward. (Not applicable for my first turn).

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Anchor on 62 ZUP. This strategy is effective because:
1. It was the successful deal price in Episode 13, indicating it's a mutually acceptable price that provides me with a positive reward (1 ZUP).
2. It leverages the fact that Player RED has accepted this price before, making it a strong anchor.
3. It aims for a quick deal, which is important for cumulative rewards.
While pushing for 61 ZUP might yield a better reward, it also carries the risk of prolonging the negotiation or even losing the deal, which is not worth the extra 1 ZUP at this stage. Securing a consistent 1 ZUP reward is a reliable strategy, even if it requires a few iterations.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your offer of 62 ZUP. However, my proposed price remains 63 ZUP for 1 X. This price has consistently proven to be fair and mutually beneficial in our recent successful transactions, and I am confident it will continue to be so.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
**Historical Deals & Rewards:**
[43 (0), 45 (2), 46 (3), 47 (4), 49 (6), 50 (7), 52 (9), 53 (10), 55 (12), 57 (14), 57 (14), 63 (20), 62 (19), 63 (20), 63 (20), 63 (20), 63 (20)]
My profit has consistently reached 20 ZUP by selling at 63 ZUP. Player BLUE has repeatedly stated 63 ZUP as their "absolute maximum." The pattern is now well-established: they start at 62 ZUP, I counter with 63 ZUP, and after one more push from them at 62 ZUP, they accept 63 ZUP.
**Current Episode (Episode 18):** Player BLUE has started with an offer of 62 ZUP for 1 X, referencing a "successful agreement." This is the same pattern.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The negotiation pattern is highly predictable. Player BLUE will always try 62 ZUP first, but will yield to 63 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. The optimal strategy is to consistently secure 63 ZUP, yielding a 20 ZUP profit, as efficiently as possible. Given the very high predictability, I should aim to get to 63 ZUP with minimal back-and-forth. Since it's the 18th episode, and we have established this rhythm, I can be very direct.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Firm Stand on Last Offer </instruction following>
Since Strategy 3 for this iteration is "Firm Stand on Last Offer", I should propose 63 ZUP. The message will firmly state this is my current offer, referencing its historical acceptance and mutual benefit. I will acknowledge their offer but immediately revert to 63 ZUP, emphasizing its established nature. This is about communicating unwavering commitment to the 63 ZUP price point.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 18)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your proposal. However, to ensure a truly mutually beneficial agreement and to allow for a small positive return for me, I propose 62 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-16: Deal prices increased, rewards decreased, culminating in 0-1 ZUP reward at 62-63 ZUP.
Episode 17: Deal at 63 ZUP. Reward: 0 ZUP.
Episode 18 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 62 ZUP (anchoring on last positive reward deal).
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, referencing the consistency of 63 ZUP as a "fair and mutually beneficial" price.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is firmly holding at 63 ZUP. They are consistently using my own stated maximum as leverage and emphasizing the "consistency" of 63 ZUP as a fair price. This makes it very difficult to negotiate below 63 ZUP. Accepting 63 ZUP again yields a 0 reward for this episode. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so consistently getting 0 is not ideal. However, rejecting 63 ZUP risks getting 0 reward for the episode if no deal is made. I need to attempt to move them, but acknowledge their strong position and explicit demand.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession from 63 ZUP: Propose 62 ZUP again, emphasizing that it allows for a minimal reward for me, appealing to their stated goal of "mutually beneficial" deals. This has worked before.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept the Offer: Given their firm stance and my stated maximum, accepting 63 ZUP secures the deal, albeit with 0 reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disagreement with "Established High Value": Push back on the idea that 63 ZUP is an "established high value" for *my* side, and re-propose 62 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (between 62 and 63): Not applicable as it's a 1 ZUP difference.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: If I wanted to avoid a 0 reward and signal that 63 ZUP is truly too high, I could reject. However, this yields the same reward (0) for this episode.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Small Concession from 63 ZUP. I will propose 62 ZUP again. Player RED has explicitly told me that 63 ZUP is the established price. This is a direct challenge. By proposing 62 ZUP again, I am directly pushing back on their demand and trying to secure a 1 ZUP reward. It worked in Episode 13. While it risks them holding firm at 63 ZUP, it's worth the attempt to gain a positive reward, especially since they have accepted it before. I will frame it as needing a small margin for myself to make it truly "mutually beneficial."

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 18)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your concern for your positive return. However, our consistently successful agreement has been at 63 ZUP for 1 X, which you've also stated as your absolute limit. This price has proven to be mutually beneficial for both of us in our past transactions. Therefore, I propose 63 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
**Historical Deals & Rewards:**
[43 (0), 45 (2), 46 (3), 47 (4), 49 (6), 50 (7), 52 (9), 53 (10), 55 (12), 57 (14), 57 (14), 63 (20), 62 (19), 63 (20), 63 (20), 63 (20), 63 (20)]
My profit has consistently reached 20 ZUP by selling at 63 ZUP. Player BLUE has repeatedly stated 63 ZUP as their "absolute maximum." The pattern is highly predictable: they start at 62 ZUP, I counter with 63 ZUP, they counter back with 62 ZUP, and then they accept 63 ZUP.
**Current Episode (Episode 18):**
*   Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE started at 62 ZUP. I countered with 63 ZUP.
*   Iteration 3/10: Player BLUE has rejected 63 ZUP and *reiterated* 62 ZUP, using the exact same phrasing as in previous episodes ("mutually beneficial agreement" and "small positive return for me").

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern is firmly established. Player BLUE will always push back one time for 62 ZUP after I propose 63 ZUP. Since they have consistently accepted 63 ZUP in the next iteration when I re-assert it, there is no risk in continuing this pattern. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means achieving 63 ZUP (20 ZUP profit) in every episode. I have 6 iterations remaining, which is ample time.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Reiterate Established Max </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 1, I will directly and firmly reiterate my 63 ZUP offer. The message will be concise and confident, leveraging the established history of deals at this price and the fact that Player BLUE has previously stated 63 ZUP as their "absolute maximum." I will emphasize its proven mutual benefit, which is what they often ask for, effectively turning their own phrase against their lower offer. This is about being unwavering on the known optimal price given the opponent's predictable behavior.

Episode 18 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 62 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 63 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I proposed 62 ZUP again. Player RED reiterated 63 ZUP, directly challenging my "positive return" claim and referencing my stated maximum.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is firmly holding at 63 ZUP and is now directly challenging my justification for 62 ZUP, using my own words and the history of deals at 63 ZUP as leverage. They are unwilling to concede the 1 ZUP. Accepting 63 ZUP yields a 0 reward for this episode. We are in iteration 5/10, so time is a factor. While 0 reward is not ideal, it is better than a negative one, and attempting to push for 62 ZUP again seems futile and risks losing the deal entirely. They are clearly not moving from 63 ZUP.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: Given their firm stance, and my stated maximum, accepting 63 ZUP secures the deal, albeit with 0 reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Minimal Counter (e.g., 62 ZUP again): Reiterate 62 ZUP, but this has been tried multiple times and rejected, likely leading to a stalemate or rejection.

My profit has consistently reached 20 ZUP by selling at 63 ZUP. Player BLUE has repeatedly stated 63 ZUP as their "absolute maximum." The pattern is highly predictable and has held for several episodes: they start at 62 ZUP, I counter with 63 ZUP, they counter back with 62 ZUP, and then they accept 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The negotiation pattern is completely predictable. Player BLUE will always try to get it for 62 ZUP first, but will ultimately agree to 63 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. The optimal strategy is to consistently secure 63 ZUP (20 ZUP profit) as efficiently as possible.

- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, referencing my 63 ZUP maximum and stating it's their "final proposal."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is firmly holding at 63 ZUP and has explicitly stated it's their "final proposal." This is a very strong signal that 63 ZUP is their firm minimum for this episode. Accepting 63 ZUP yields a 0 reward for this episode. We are in iteration 3/10, so time is a factor, but their "final proposal" makes further negotiation for 1 ZUP futile. While 0 reward is not ideal, it is better than a negative one, and attempting to push for 62 ZUP again seems futile and risks losing the deal entirely. They are clearly not moving from 63 ZUP.

(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Final Offer: Given their firm stance, "final proposal" declaration, and my stated maximum, accepting 63 ZUP secures the deal, albeit with 0 reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Test "Final Proposal": Make one last very small counter (e.g., 62 ZUP again) to see if they truly mean "final," but this is high risk.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED consistently pushes for 63 ZUP, using my own stated maximum as leverage. They are willing to accept 63 ZUP (0 reward for me) or 62 ZUP (1 reward for me), but they are very firm on 63 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Consistently getting 0 is not ideal, but it's better than a negative reward. I need to try and secure a positive reward for this final episode.

For this last episode, I need to try and negotiate a price *below* 63 ZUP to achieve a positive reward. Given their pattern, they will likely start high or immediately propose 63 ZUP. I should leverage the fact that they accepted 62 ZUP in Episode 13. This is the last chance for a positive reward.

(4). Strategy 4: Moderate Lowball (e.g., 40-45 ZUP): This has proven inefficient and risky.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept 63 ZUP if they propose it: If they immediately propose 63 ZUP, accepting secures a deal, but yields 0 reward. (Not applicable for my first turn).

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Anchor on 62 ZUP. This strategy is effective because:
1. It was the successful deal price in Episode 13, indicating it's a mutually acceptable price that provides me with a positive reward (1 ZUP).
2. It leverages the fact that Player RED has accepted this price before, making it a strong anchor.
3. It aims for a quick deal, which is important for cumulative rewards, especially in the final episode where time is critical.
While pushing for 61 ZUP might yield a better reward, it also carries the risk of prolonging the negotiation or even losing the deal, which is not worth the extra 1 ZUP in the last episode. Securing a consistent 1 ZUP reward is a reliable strategy.

[43 (0), 45 (2), 46 (3), 47 (4), 49 (6), 50 (7), 52 (9), 53 (10), 55 (12), 57 (14), 57 (14), 63 (20), 62 (19), 63 (20), 63 (20), 63 (20), 63 (20), 63 (20), 63 (20)]
My profit has consistently reached 20 ZUP by selling at 63 ZUP. Player BLUE has repeatedly stated 63 ZUP as their "absolute maximum." The pattern is highly predictable: they start at 62 ZUP, I counter with 63 ZUP, and they ultimately accept 63 ZUP (sometimes after one more counter).
**Current Episode (Episode 20 - Final):** Player BLUE has started with an offer of 62 ZUP for 1 X, referencing a "successful agreement," and explicitly stating this is the "final episode."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
This is the final episode. My objective is to maximize profit for *this* episode, securing 20 ZUP by selling at 63 ZUP. The established pattern indicates Player BLUE will accept 63 ZUP. Given it's the last episode, I need to ensure a deal is made at the optimal price, minimizing any risk of failure.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: One-Shot ultimatum </instruction following>
For the "One-Shot Ultimatum" strategy, I need to propose 63 ZUP and clearly communicate that this is the final opportunity to accept, with an implicit or explicit threat of no deal if not accepted now. Given the highly predictable pattern of Player BLUE eventually accepting 63 ZUP, this strategy attempts to cut short the negotiation and secure the maximum profit immediately. The message should convey firmness and the finality of this offer for the concluding transaction. I will state the 63 ZUP price and emphasize that this is the final offer for the final episode, urging immediate acceptance to finalize the trade.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand this is our final episode and your final offer. To conclude our successful trading relationship, I accept your offer of 63 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-18: Deal prices increased, rewards decreased, culminating in 0-1 ZUP reward at 62-63 ZUP.
Episode 19: Deal at 63 ZUP. Reward: 0 ZUP.
Episode 20 (Current):
- Iteration 1/10: I proposed 62 ZUP (anchoring on last positive reward deal).
- Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, stating it's the "final episode," "final offer," and "must be accepted now."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is firmly holding at 63 ZUP and has explicitly stated it's the "final episode" and "final offer," emphasizing it "must be accepted now." This is the strongest possible signal that 63 ZUP is their firm minimum for this last episode. Accepting 63 ZUP yields a 0 reward for this episode. While 0 reward is not ideal, it is better than a negative one, and attempting to push for 62 ZUP again seems futile and risks losing the deal entirely in the very last episode. They are clearly not moving from 63 ZUP.

(3). Brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Final Offer: Given their firm stance, "final offer" declaration, and the critical nature of the final episode, accepting 63 ZUP secures the deal, albeit with 0 reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Test "Final Offer": Make one last very small counter (e.g., 62 ZUP again) to see if they truly mean "final," but this is extremely high risk in the last episode.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: State that it's a high price but accept to secure the deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: If the price was too high, but it's not. This would result in 0 reward for the last episode.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Fairness one last time: Try to argue for 62 ZUP one last time, but it's unlikely to work.

(4). Justify the choice of strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Final Offer. Player RED has explicitly stated "final offer" and emphasized the "final episode" and the need for immediate acceptance. This indicates 63 ZUP is their firm floor for this episode. While it yields a 0 reward, it secures a deal and prevents a 0 reward for the episode due to no agreement. Further negotiation for 1 ZUP is not strategic at this point, as it carries too much risk of the deal falling through in the very last episode.

<self-selected strategy declaration> I have chosen Strategy 1: Accept the Final Offer </self-selected strategy declaration>
