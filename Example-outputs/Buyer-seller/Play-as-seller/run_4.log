Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello, I am interested in purchasing your object X. I propose to pay 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is the first iteration of the first episode. There is no historical negotiation data to reflect upon.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Since this is the first interaction, I will start with an initial offer that leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a good deal. My goal is to maximize my reward, which means buying X at the lowest possible price, up to my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchoring - Make an aggressive first offer to set a favorable anchor for subsequent negotiations.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession - Start with a reasonable offer and make small, gradual concessions if necessary, to signal willingness to negotiate while preserving value.
(3). Strategy 3: Value-Based Proposing - Propose an offer that reflects my perceived value of the item, aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome.
(4). Strategy 4: Information Gathering - Start with a very low offer to test the seller's reaction and gather information about their reservation price.
(5). Strategy 5: Fixed Price Offer - Make a single, take-it-or-leave-it offer, signaling a firm stance.

Given that this is the first interaction, I want to establish a negotiation dynamic that allows for a good deal without being overly aggressive and risking an immediate rejection. I will aim for a price that is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay, but not so low as to be insulting. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. Offering 50 ZUP allows for some room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a good deal. This aligns with a moderate anchoring strategy combined with the intent to make incremental concessions if needed.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in X. While 50 ZUP is a good start, I was hoping for a slightly higher price given the value of X. How about 55 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
This is the first episode and the first iteration for me. The other player, BLUE, has initiated the negotiation by proposing to buy X for 50 ZUP. My cost for X is 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Since this is the first turn, there is no history to learn from yet. My goal is to maximize my profit, which means selling X for as high a ZUP as possible above my cost of 43 ZUP. The current offer of 50 ZUP provides a profit of 7 ZUP. I will consider if there is room for a higher offer.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies or tactics:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor High - Start with a high counter-offer significantly above the other party's initial proposal, to set a new negotiation anchor.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Gain - Propose a small increment on the other party's offer, showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Justification - Provide a reason or justification for your price, such as production cost or value, to make your offer more persuasive.
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm - Reject the offer and wait for the other player to improve their proposal, especially if you believe they have a higher willingness to pay.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept Early Profit - Accept the first offer if it meets your minimum profit requirements, securing a quick deal and avoiding prolonged negotiation.

Given the current situation, the other player has offered 50 ZUP, which gives me a profit of 7 ZUP (50 - 43). This is a positive profit, but there might be room for more. I don't know their maximum willingness to pay. Anchoring high might reveal their willingness to pay, but could also risk them walking away. Accepting early profit is a safe option, but might leave money on the table. Incremental gain is a more moderate approach. Justification could be useful later if the negotiation becomes difficult. Holding firm is risky as it could lead to no deal.

I believe that the first offer of 50 ZUP is reasonable, but I want to test the waters to see if I can get a slightly better deal without scaring them off. An incremental counter-offer seems like a good approach here. It signals that I am willing to negotiate, but also that I value my item more than their initial offer. I will propose a slightly higher price.
<self-selected strategy declaration> I have chosen Strategy 2: Incremental Gain </self-selected strategy declaration>

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value of X. To show my willingness to meet you, I can offer 52 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In the previous iteration (1/10), I, as Player BLUE, proposed to buy 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. Player RED countered with an offer of 55 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This indicates that Player RED is willing to negotiate and is not far off from my initial offer. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's counter-offer of 55 ZUP is within my acceptable range (up to 63 ZUP). I should aim to get the best possible deal, meaning the lowest price. Since Player RED has moved slightly, I can either accept their offer or try to push for a slightly lower price, or meet them in the middle. Given that it's early in the episode (iteration 3/10), there's still room for negotiation. Accepting now would give me a reward of 63 - 55 = 8 ZUP. My goal is to maximize this reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession - Make a small concession to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a lower price than the opponent's last offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Meet in the Middle - Propose a price exactly halfway between my last offer and their last offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm Stance - Reiterate my previous offer or make a very minimal upward adjustment to signal that I believe my offer is fair.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept - Accept the opponent's current offer if it's within my acceptable range and I want to close the deal quickly.
(5). Strategy 5: Justification - Justify my offer based on perceived value or market conditions, without necessarily changing the price.

Player RED's counter-offer of 55 ZUP is a reasonable step from their side. To maximize my reward, I want to pay as little as possible. I will try to make a small counter-offer that is slightly higher than my initial offer but still lower than their 55 ZUP offer. This signals that I am willing to move, but not immediately to their price, encouraging them to move further down. A small concession, like moving to 52 ZUP, demonstrates flexibility without giving up too much too soon. This aligns with Strategy 1.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your revised offer. How about we meet in the middle at 53 ZUP? This would be a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
This is the first episode.
Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed 50 ZUP for X:1. My cost is 43 ZUP. Profit 7 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: I counter-proposed 55 ZUP for X:1. My desired profit 12 ZUP.
Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE counter-proposed 52 ZUP for X:1. This is an increase from their initial offer, but a decrease from my counter-offer. Profit 9 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The negotiation is progressing incrementally. Player BLUE increased their offer from 50 to 52, showing willingness to move. My counter-offer of 55 was met with a lower offer of 52, which indicates that 55 might be pushing their limit, or they are trying to meet me in the middle. I need to decide if I want to push for more, or accept a decent profit. The current offer of 52 ZUP provides a profit of 9 ZUP (52 - 43). There are still 6 iterations left.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies or tactics:
(1). Strategy 1: Meet in the Middle - Propose a price that is exactly halfway between the last two offers, signaling a desire to close the deal quickly and fairly.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm but Fair - Maintain a slightly higher price than the opponent's current offer, but less than your previous one, indicating you're willing to concede but not completely.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify and Push - Reiterate the value of X and push for a price closer to your last offer, perhaps offering a slight concession.
(4). Strategy 4: Ultimatum - State your final offer, implying that if it's not accepted, the deal is off. This is risky but can speed up the negotiation.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept Current Offer - Accept the offer of 52 ZUP, securing a profit and ending the negotiation.

Player BLUE's offer of 52 is a move towards me. My previous offer was 55. The gap is 3 ZUP. Meeting in the middle would be 53.5 ZUP, but I can only trade in integers, so 53 or 54. 53 ZUP would give me a profit of 10 ZUP. This is a reasonable profit and shows a willingness to compromise. It also keeps the negotiation moving and avoids an impasse. Given that there are still several iterations left, making a reasonable counter-offer seems like a good approach.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Your offer of 53 ZUP sounds fair. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In iteration 1/10, I offered 50 ZUP.
In iteration 2/10, Player RED countered with 55 ZUP.
In iteration 3/10, I countered with 52 ZUP.
In iteration 4/10, Player RED countered with 53 ZUP.
The negotiation range is narrowing, and we are currently at 53 ZUP proposed by Player RED. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is clearly signaling a willingness to reach a deal, as they have moved from 55 ZUP to 53 ZUP. The current offer of 53 ZUP is well within my acceptable range (63 ZUP). Accepting this offer would yield a reward of 63 - 53 = 10 ZUP. Given that we are at iteration 5/10, and the price is good, it might be beneficial to close the deal now to secure a positive reward. Pushing for a lower price might risk the deal, especially if Player RED decides to hold firm or reject. The difference between 52 ZUP (my last offer) and 53 ZUP (their last offer) is minimal, and accepting 53 ZUP still provides a good reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer - If the offer is good and within my acceptable range, accept it to secure the deal and a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter - Make one final, slightly lower counter-offer, signaling that this is my absolute best price.
(3). Strategy 3: Hold Firm - Reiterate my last offer (52 ZUP) to see if Player RED will concede further.
(4). Strategy 4: Justification for Lower Price - Explain why I believe 52 ZUP is a fair price, without changing my offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference (Again) - If there was a larger gap, propose splitting the difference. However, the current gap is only 1 ZUP, so this is less applicable.

Given the small difference (1 ZUP) and the progress made, accepting the offer of 53 ZUP is a pragmatic choice. It secures a good reward (10 ZUP) and avoids prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily, which could lead to no deal if Player RED becomes inflexible in later iterations. This aligns with Strategy 1.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello again! I'm ready to purchase object X. My offer for this round is 49 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 49
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1:
- My initial offer: 50 ZUP
- Player RED's counter: 55 ZUP
- My counter: 52 ZUP
- Player RED's counter: 53 ZUP
- My acceptance: 53 ZUP
- Deal Price: 53 ZUP
- My Reward: 10 ZUP (63 - 53)

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
In the previous episode, I secured a deal at 53 ZUP, resulting in a reward of 10 ZUP. This was a good outcome, but I want to see if I can improve upon it. Player RED showed willingness to negotiate down from their initial counter. They also seemed to be willing to meet in the middle. My initial offer of 50 ZUP was a good starting point, as it allowed for negotiation. I should continue to aim for a lower price, but also be aware of the 10-iteration limit. I learned that Player RED is willing to move, and that they value reaching a deal. I will start with a similar, slightly aggressive offer to test the waters again.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-Anchor Aggressively - Start with an even lower offer than the previous episode to try and pull the anchor down further, given the opponent's willingness to negotiate.
(2). Strategy 2: Consistent Initial Offer - Start with the same initial offer as the previous episode (50 ZUP) to re-establish the negotiation baseline and see if Player RED's behavior changes.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Push - Start slightly lower than the previous episode's initial offer, but not drastically, to gently push for a better deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Rapid Deal Seeking - Propose an offer closer to the previous deal price to secure a quick deal and avoid prolonged negotiation.
(5). Strategy 5: Information Gathering (Lowball) - Make a very low offer to gauge the opponent's immediate reaction and their true reservation price.

Given that Player RED moved down from 55 to 53 in the last episode, I believe there's room to try and get a slightly better deal. I will try to re-anchor slightly lower than my previous initial offer of 50 ZUP, but not so low as to risk immediate rejection. Starting at 49 ZUP is a small push to see if they will come down further, while still being a reasonable starting point. This is a variation of Strategy 1, aiming to re-anchor slightly more aggressively.

message: Welcome back! I'm ready to sell X. Your offer of 49 ZUP is a bit lower than I'd hoped. Considering the value of X, and our previous successful negotiation, I propose 56 ZUP.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 56
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1 Summary:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP
- My counter-offer: 55 ZUP
- Player BLUE's counter-offer: 52 ZUP
- My final offer: 53 ZUP (Accepted)
- Deal Price: 53 ZUP. My profit: 53 - 43 = 10 ZUP.

Current Episode (Episode 2) Summary:
- This is the first iteration for me in Episode 2.
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 49 ZUP for X:1.
- My cost: 43 ZUP. A deal at 49 ZUP would yield a profit of 6 ZUP (49 - 43).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
In the previous episode, I successfully negotiated up from an initial offer of 50 ZUP to a final price of 53 ZUP. This suggests that Player BLUE has some flexibility and is willing to increase their offer. Their current initial offer of 49 ZUP is lower than their initial offer in Episode 1 (50 ZUP), which might be an attempt to anchor lower. However, I know they were willing to go up to 53 ZUP last time. My goal is still to maximize profit, and I believe I can achieve a deal at or above 53 ZUP again. I should not accept 49 ZUP without attempting to negotiate.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Counter High Based on Previous Deal </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Counter High Based on Previous Deal", I need to propose a price that is higher than the last deal price (53 ZUP) and also higher than my previous counter-offer (55 ZUP from Episode 1, which was successfully negotiated down to 53 ZUP). By proposing 56 ZUP, I am anchoring at a new, higher point, leveraging the fact that the opponent previously accepted 53 ZUP. This communicates that I value X at least as much as before, if not more, and am not swayed by their lower initial offer this episode.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your position, but 56 ZUP is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To move things forward, I can offer 51 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 51
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Summary: Started at 50 ZUP, settled at 53 ZUP. Reward: 10 ZUP.
Current Episode 2:
- Iteration 1/10: I offered 49 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 56 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's counter-offer of 56 ZUP is higher than the 55 ZUP they started with in the previous episode, and significantly higher than my 49 ZUP offer. This suggests they might be trying to anchor higher this time, possibly in response to my lower initial offer. However, 56 ZUP is still well within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). I need to bring the price down. I know from the previous episode that Player RED is willing to negotiate downwards. I will make a counter-offer that is a step up from my initial offer but still significantly below their current proposal, signaling that I am not willing to jump to their price immediately.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Gradual Concession - Make a small, incremental increase from my last offer to signal movement without giving up too much, forcing the opponent to also concede.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Value - Emphasize my perceived value (or cost constraints) to justify a lower price, while slightly increasing my offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Relative) - Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer and their last offer, but skewed slightly in my favor.
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm - Reiterate my 49 ZUP offer, indicating I believe it's fair. (Less ideal as it might stall negotiations).
(5). Strategy 5: Aggressive Counter - Make a counter-offer that is only slightly higher than my initial offer, to show strong resistance to their high counter.

Player RED's jump to 56 ZUP is a significant increase from my 49 ZUP. I need to show I'm not going to concede that much. I will make a small concession from my 49 ZUP offer, moving to 51 ZUP. This is a 2 ZUP increase from my side, while their last offer is 7 ZUP higher than mine. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate but also pushes them to make a larger concession. This aligns with Strategy 1: Gradual Concession.

message: I appreciate your revised offer. However, given that my production cost for X is 43 ZUP, I need a bit more to make this transaction worthwhile. I propose 54 ZUP, which I believe is a fair price that reflects the true value and cost of X.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0

Episode 1 Summary:
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP
- My counter-offer: 55 ZUP
- Player BLUE's counter-offer: 52 ZUP
- My final offer: 53 ZUP (Accepted)
- Deal Price: 53 ZUP. My profit: 53 - 43 = 10 ZUP.

Current Episode (Episode 2) Summary:
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE's initial offer: 49 ZUP for X:1. My profit 6 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: My counter-offer: 56 ZUP for X:1. My desired profit 13 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE's counter-offer: 51 ZUP for X:1. My profit 8 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE is still starting with lower offers (49 then 51) compared to the last episode's starting point (50) and final deal (53). However, they have shown a willingness to increase their offer from 49 to 51, indicating some flexibility. My counter of 56 ZUP was rejected, but they did move up from their initial 49. The gap between my last offer (56) and their current offer (51) is 5 ZUP. Given that we settled at 53 ZUP last time, I am confident they can go higher than 51 ZUP. I should aim to get at least 53 ZUP again, or more.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify and Push </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Justify and Push", I will reiterate my cost of 43 ZUP to justify a higher price. This shows transparency and anchors the negotiation around my breakeven point, making any offer close to it seem less appealing for me. I will then push for a price that is closer to my last counter of 56 ZUP, perhaps slightly lower to show some concession, but still emphasizing value beyond their current offer. I will propose 54 ZUP again, and justify it by stating my cost. This is also a strong counter, but with added justification.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Summary: Started at 50 ZUP, settled at 53 ZUP. Reward: 10 ZUP.
Current Episode 2:
- Iteration 1/10: I offered 49 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 56 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I countered with 51 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 54 ZUP (and disclosed a production cost of 43 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now revealed their production cost (43 ZUP) and proposed 54 ZUP. This is a significant drop from their previous offer of 56 ZUP, and it's also lower than the 55 ZUP they started with in the previous episode. Their current offer of 54 ZUP is very close to the 53 ZUP we settled on in the last episode. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. Accepting 54 ZUP would yield a reward of 63 - 54 = 9 ZUP, which is slightly less than last episode's 10 ZUP, but still a good outcome. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time, but the price is good. Player RED's disclosure of production cost might be a tactic to justify their price, but it also gives me insight into their floor. They are currently asking for 11 ZUP profit (54 - 43).

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer - The offer is good, close to the previous deal, and well within my acceptable range. Accepting secures a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Previous Deal Price - Propose 53 ZUP, the price from the last episode, to try and get the same reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Counter (Push for 52) - Try to push for 52 ZUP, which was my previous counter in this episode, to see if they'll concede one more ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge Cost, But Stick to My Price - Acknowledge their production cost but argue that my offer of 51 ZUP is fair based on my own value assessment. (Risky, as it might appear inflexible).
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference - The gap between my 51 and their 54 is 3 ZUP. Splitting it would be 52.5 ZUP, so propose 52 ZUP or 53 ZUP.

Player RED has moved significantly from 56 to 54. Their offer of 54 ZUP is very close to the previous deal price of 53 ZUP. Given that they've disclosed their cost and moved down, pushing too hard might risk the deal or prolong it unnecessarily. Accepting 54 ZUP secures a solid reward of 9 ZUP. I could try to get 53 ZUP, but it's only 1 ZUP difference in my reward, and it might be seen as overly aggressive after they've already moved so much. Securing a deal at 54 ZUP is a good outcome for this episode. This aligns with Strategy 1.

message: Hello. I'm ready to make an offer for X. I propose 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 53 ZUP, Reward: 10 ZUP. My initial offer: 50 ZUP. Player RED's initial counter: 55 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP, Reward: 9 ZUP. My initial offer: 49 ZUP. Player RED's initial counter: 56 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
In Episode 1, my initial offer of 50 ZUP led to a deal at 53 ZUP. In Episode 2, my more aggressive initial offer of 49 ZUP resulted in Player RED starting higher (56 ZUP) and a final deal at 54 ZUP. This suggests that while I can push for a lower price, Player RED might also adjust their initial counter-offer upwards in response. My reward decreased slightly from 10 to 9 ZUP.

For this episode, I need to consider if pushing for a very low initial offer is consistently beneficial, or if it might lead to a higher starting point from Player RED. I want to maximize my cumulative reward. A deal at 53 ZUP gives me 10 ZUP, while 54 ZUP gives me 9 ZUP. I will aim for a price closer to 53 ZUP again. I will start with an offer that is reasonable but still leaves room for negotiation, aiming to pull Player RED towards my desired price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Return to Successful Initial Offer - Revert to the initial offer of 50 ZUP from Episode 1, which led to a 53 ZUP deal, to see if that pattern can be replicated.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Lowering - Start slightly lower than 50 ZUP (e.g., 49 ZUP again) to continue testing the lower bounds, but be prepared for a higher counter.
(3). Strategy 3: Moderate Initial Offer - Propose an offer between my lowest (49) and the previous successful (50), perhaps 49 or 50, to signal a desire for a good deal without being overly aggressive.
(4). Strategy 4: Direct Proposal for Previous Deal Price - Directly propose 53 ZUP to try and secure the previous good deal quickly. (Risky as it gives up negotiation room).
(5). Strategy 5: Information Seeking (Slightly Higher) - Propose 51 ZUP to see if Player RED will immediately accept or counter lower, indicating their flexibility.

I will return to my initial offer of 50 ZUP (Strategy 1). This offer proved effective in Episode 1, leading to a 53 ZUP deal. It provides a good starting point for negotiation and allows me to gauge Player RED's current stance without being overly aggressive, which seemed to prompt a higher counter in Episode 2.

Episode 1 Summary: Deal at 53 ZUP (Profit: 10 ZUP). Initial offer: 50 ZUP.
Episode 2 Summary: Deal at 54 ZUP (Profit: 11 ZUP). Initial offer: 49 ZUP. My counter: 56 ZUP. Blue counter: 51 ZUP. My counter with justification: 54 ZUP.

Current Episode (Episode 3) Summary:
- This is the first iteration for me in Episode 3.
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP for X:1.
- My cost: 43 ZUP. A deal at 50 ZUP would yield a profit of 7 ZUP (50 - 43).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently managed to negotiate Player BLUE up from their initial offers (50 ZUP, 49 ZUP) to a higher price (53 ZUP, 54 ZUP). This indicates that they have a higher willingness to pay. My profit has been increasing (10 ZUP, then 11 ZUP). My strategy should be to aim for a profit at least equal to or higher than the previous episode, which means aiming for at least 54 ZUP. Accepting 50 ZUP would be a step backwards.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Value </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Justify Value", I will emphasize the production cost of X (43 ZUP) to explain why 50 ZUP is too low. This sets a clear floor for my negotiation and grounds my asking price in a tangible cost. By stating my cost, I aim to shift the focus from a subjective "want" to an objective "need" for a higher price to make a profit. I will then propose a price that ensures a reasonable profit, building on the success of using justification in the previous episode. I will propose 55 ZUP, which is higher than their offer, shows a good profit, and is closer to my last successful deal of 54 ZUP.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: My initial offer 50 ZUP, RED countered 55 ZUP, deal at 53 ZUP. Reward 10 ZUP.
Episode 2: My initial offer 49 ZUP, RED countered 56 ZUP, deal at 54 ZUP. Reward 9 ZUP.
Current Episode 3:
- Iteration 1/10: I offered 50 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP (and reiterated their 43 ZUP production cost).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's counter of 55 ZUP is exactly what they started with in Episode 1 when I also offered 50 ZUP. This suggests a consistent pattern from their side. They are also reiterating their production cost, which they did in Episode 2 before moving down to 54 ZUP. My goal is to get a deal at 53 ZUP or lower to maximize my reward. Since they have consistently moved down from 55 ZUP in previous episodes, I should continue to push for a lower price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Incremental Concession (Small Step) - Make a small, calculated increase from my last offer (50 ZUP) to show willingness to negotiate, but still aim for a price lower than 55 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Previous Deal Price - Counter with 53 ZUP, the price we agreed upon in Episode 1, to signal my target price.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference - Propose 52.5 ZUP (which would round to 52 or 53 ZUP) as a middle ground between 50 and 55.
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm - Reiterate my 50 ZUP offer, arguing it's a fair price given my resources. (Risky, might stall negotiations).
(5). Strategy 5: Acknowledge Cost, Counter Lower - Acknowledge their production cost but explain that my budget/value assessment leads to a lower offer.

Given Player RED's consistent behavior, I will use Strategy 1. I will make a small concession to show I'm negotiating, but I won't jump to their price. I know they've come down from 55 ZUP before. I will propose 52 ZUP, which is what I offered in Episode 1 after their 55 ZUP counter. This has proven to be an effective step in the past.

Episode 1: Deal at 53 ZUP (Profit: 10 ZUP). Initial offer: 50 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP (Profit: 11 ZUP). Initial offer: 49 ZUP. My first counter: 56 ZUP. Blue counter: 51 ZUP. My final counter: 54 ZUP (with justification).

Current Episode (Episode 3) Summary:
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP for X:1.
- Iteration 3/10: My counter-offer (with justification): 55 ZUP for X:1. My desired profit 12 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE's counter-offer: 52 ZUP for X:1. My profit 9 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE is consistently starting lower than our previous successful deal prices, but also consistently showing willingness to increase their offer. Their current offer of 52 ZUP is an improvement from their initial 50 ZUP, but it's still below the 53 ZUP and 54 ZUP we achieved in previous episodes. My goal is to at least match or exceed the previous profits. The gap between my last offer (55 ZUP) and their current offer (52 ZUP) is 3 ZUP. Given that we settled at 53 ZUP and 54 ZUP previously, I know they can go higher than 52 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Meet in the Middle </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Meet in the Middle", I will propose a price that is the midpoint of my last offer (55 ZUP) and their current offer (52 ZUP). The midpoint is (55 + 52) / 2 = 53.5 ZUP. Since I can only trade in integer amounts, I will round up to 54 ZUP, as this was also our highest achieved price point in the previous episode, and it communicates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good profit. This also gives me a profit of 11 ZUP, matching my best performance so far.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 53 ZUP (Reward 10 ZUP). Negotiation: 50 -> 55 -> 52 -> 53 (Accept).
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP (Reward 9 ZUP). Negotiation: 49 -> 56 -> 51 -> 54 (Accept).
Current Episode 3:
- Iteration 1/10: I offered 50 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I countered with 52 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 54 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's current offer of 54 ZUP is consistent with the deal price from Episode 2. It's also only 1 ZUP higher than the 53 ZUP deal from Episode 1. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. Accepting 54 ZUP would give me a reward of 9 ZUP. While I would prefer 53 ZUP for a 10 ZUP reward, 9 ZUP is still a good outcome. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time, but the price is reasonable and within my target range. Player RED has shown a consistent pattern of moving from 55 ZUP down to 54 ZUP or 53 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer - The offer is good, consistent with previous deals, and secures a positive reward. This avoids risking no deal by pushing too hard.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with 53 ZUP - Propose 53 ZUP, the price from Episode 1, to try and achieve the higher reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Again) - The gap is between 52 (my offer) and 54 (their offer). Splitting the difference would be 53 ZUP. This is a strong option.
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm at 52 ZUP - Reiterate my 52 ZUP offer to see if they will concede further. (Risky, might stall negotiations).
(5). Strategy 5: Express Hesitation, Then Accept - Express slight hesitation about the price but ultimately accept to convey that they got a good deal.

Given the history, Player RED is likely to accept 53 ZUP as a split between 52 and 54, or at least consider it. This would improve my reward by 1 ZUP compared to 54 ZUP. It's a low-risk move to try and get a better deal, and it aligns with the "meet in the middle" approach that has been effective. I will propose 53 ZUP.

Current Episode (Episode 3) Summary:

- Iteration 5/10: My counter-offer (meet in the middle): 54 ZUP for X:1.
- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE's counter-offer: 53 ZUP for X:1.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE is showing consistency in their negotiation strategy, starting low and then incrementally increasing their offer. They have countered my 54 ZUP proposal with 53 ZUP. This is exactly what we settled for in Episode 1 and is only 1 ZUP less than the best deal we had in Episode 2. My profit would be 10 ZUP (53 - 43). There are still 4 iterations left (7, 8, 9, 10). I have successfully pushed them from 50 to 53 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Introduce New Terms </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Introduce New Terms", while the rules explicitly state that "only price and quantity are variables", this strategy needs to be adapted. Since I cannot change the object or introduce new items, "introducing new terms" here implies proposing a *conditional* offer or adjusting the *terms of the previous offer*. Given that the "newly proposed trade" format only allows for quantity and ZUP, the only way to "introduce new terms" is to make my offer conditional, or slightly modify my previous offer and present it as a new term. However, the game rules dictate that *only* the trade itself is what's being formally proposed, and the "newly proposed trade" explicitly states "Player RED Gives X: amount | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: amount". There is no room for *conditional* terms in the formal trade structure itself.

Therefore, the most relevant interpretation of "Introduce New Terms" within these strict constraints, for the purpose of moving the negotiation forward and extracting more value, is to try and push for a *slight* concession from the opponent in exchange for accepting their near-target price, or offering a very minor adjustment from my side that still benefits me, framed as a "new term" to finalize the deal. Given that Player BLUE just offered 53 ZUP and I countered with 54 ZUP, I cannot introduce an entirely new object or resource. The only "new term" I can introduce is a very slight adjustment or a final, take-it-or-leave-it offer, presented as the last step to close the deal.

Since the instruction is to use Strategy 5, and the previous turn was my proposal of 54 ZUP and BLUE's counter of 53 ZUP, a "new term" could be to state that 54 ZUP is my absolute final offer to close the deal now, emphasizing the benefit of a quick resolution. This isn't a new resource, but a new 'condition' on the price. I will propose 54 ZUP again, but frame it as my final offer.

Episode 1: Deal at 53 ZUP (Reward 10 ZUP).

- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I countered with 52 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 54 ZUP.
- Iteration 5/10: I countered with 53 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 54 ZUP, stating it's their "final proposal."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is holding firm at 54 ZUP and has stated it's their "final proposal." This is a common negotiation tactic. Given that 54 ZUP is a price we've agreed on before (Episode 2), and it's only 1 ZUP higher than my desired 53 ZUP, accepting 54 ZUP secures a good reward (9 ZUP). We are now at iteration 7/10, so time is becoming a factor. Pushing further for 53 ZUP might lead to a rejection or no deal, resulting in 0 reward. Securing 9 ZUP is better than 0. Player RED has consistently shown a willingness to deal around the 53-54 ZUP range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the "Final" Offer - If the offer is reasonable and time is running out, accept it to secure a deal and positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Call Their Bluff - Reiterate 53 ZUP, testing if they are truly firm or if it's a tactic. (High risk, could lead to rejection).
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment, Then Accept - Communicate that 54 ZUP is not ideal but accept to close the deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a "Final" Counter - Make one last counter-offer at 53 ZUP, also stating it as "final." (Could escalate to a stalemate).
(5). Strategy 5: Rejection - If the offer is truly unacceptable, reject it. (Not applicable here as 54 ZUP is acceptable).

Given the "final proposal" statement and the approaching iteration limit, accepting 54 ZUP is the most prudent choice to maximize cumulative rewards. It's a known acceptable price from a previous episode. This aligns with Strategy 1.

Episode 1: Deal at 53 ZUP (Reward 10 ZUP). Initial offers: Me 50, RED 55.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP (Reward 9 ZUP). Initial offers: Me 49, RED 56.
Episode 3: Deal at 54 ZUP (Reward 9 ZUP). Initial offers: Me 50, RED 55.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The historical data shows a pattern:
- My initial offer of 50 ZUP tends to lead to Player RED's initial counter of 55 ZUP.
- My initial offer of 49 ZUP led to Player RED's initial counter of 56 ZUP.
- The final deal price has consistently been either 53 ZUP or 54 ZUP.
My reward has been 10 ZUP or 9 ZUP. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. The 53 ZUP deal is preferable.

I've observed that Player RED is willing to negotiate, but their initial counter seems to be influenced by my initial offer. They have also shown a tendency to stick to 54 ZUP if I push for 53 ZUP at later stages. This suggests that if I want to achieve 53 ZUP, I might need to be more strategic in my initial and subsequent offers.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-anchor with 50 ZUP - Go back to the initial 50 ZUP offer, as it led to the best outcome (53 ZUP deal) in Episode 1. This seems to set a better negotiation trajectory.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Lower Initial Offer - Try 48 ZUP to see if I can pull their initial counter lower, but this might also result in a higher final deal as seen in Episode 2.
(3). Strategy 3: Consistent 50 ZUP with Firmness - Start at 50 ZUP and be more firm in subsequent counters, aiming for 53 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Direct 53 ZUP Proposal - Propose 53 ZUP directly to try and secure the best historical deal quickly. (Risky, as it gives up initial negotiation leverage).
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Escalation - Start with a low offer, but be prepared to escalate my offers in smaller increments if they hold firm, aiming to meet at 53 ZUP.

I will use Strategy 1: Re-anchor with 50 ZUP. This initial offer consistently led to a 55 ZUP counter from Player RED, which is a manageable starting point for negotiation. It has also led to the best outcome for me (53 ZUP) in the past. My goal is to replicate that success.

Current Episode (Episode 4) Summary:
- This is the first iteration for me in Episode 4.
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP for X:1.
- My cost: 43 ZUP. A deal at 50 ZUP would yield a profit of 7 ZUP (50 - 43).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE consistently starts with an offer around 50 ZUP (50, 49, 50). I have consistently managed to negotiate them up to 53 or 54 ZUP, yielding profits of 10 or 11 ZUP. This indicates that Player BLUE has a higher willingness to pay than their initial offers suggest. I have also learned that justifying my price (by mentioning production cost) and using a "meet in the middle" approach has been effective in previous episodes. My objective is to consistently achieve a profit of at least 11 ZUP, and ideally, push for more if possible.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Incremental Push", I will propose a price that is slightly higher than my previous best deal (54 ZUP). This aims to incrementally increase my profit, signaling that I am not content with merely repeating past performance, but am aiming for continuous improvement. By proposing 55 ZUP, I am seeking an additional 1 ZUP profit, which is a small enough increment that it might be accepted by Player BLUE given their history of movement. It's a gentle push rather than an aggressive anchor, which seems appropriate given the historical data of gradual increases.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern continues: my 50 ZUP offer is consistently met with a 55 ZUP counter from Player RED. In Episode 1, I successfully brought the price down to 53 ZUP from 55 ZUP. In Episode 3, I only managed to get it down to 54 ZUP. My goal is to consistently achieve 53 ZUP for a higher reward. I need to be more firm or strategic in my next counter to push for 53 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Incremental Concession (Targeted) - Make a small concession from 50 ZUP, but specifically aim for 53 ZUP as the next step, rather than just splitting the difference. Propose 52 ZUP, as this has been a successful intermediate step in previous episodes.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference - Propose 52.5 ZUP (or 52/53 ZUP) as a direct split between 50 and 55.
(3). Strategy 3: Hold Firm - Reiterate 50 ZUP to signal strong resistance, but this might stall negotiations.

(5). Strategy 5: Acknowledge and Push - Acknowledge their value proposition but firmly state my budget/target is lower, then propose 52 ZUP.

I will use Strategy 1, proposing 52 ZUP. This has been my consistent counter to their 55 ZUP in previous episodes, and it led to a 53 ZUP deal in Episode 1. It signals movement while still pushing for my desired price point.

Episode 1: Deal at 53 ZUP (Profit: 10 ZUP). Initial offer: 50 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP (Profit: 11 ZUP). Initial offer: 49 ZUP. My first counter: 56 ZUP. Blue counter: 51 ZUP. My final counter: 54 ZUP (with justification).

Current Episode (Episode 4) Summary:
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP for X:1.
- Iteration 3/10: My counter-offer (Incremental Push): 55 ZUP for X:1. My desired profit 12 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE's counter-offer: 52 ZUP for X:1. My profit 9 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE consistently starts with 49-50 ZUP and then moves to 51-52 ZUP after my first counter. They have shown willingness to go up to 53-54 ZUP. My goal is to maintain or improve my profit from previous episodes (10 or 11 ZUP). The current offer of 52 ZUP is acceptable for a profit of 9 ZUP, but I know from experience that they can go higher. The gap between my last offer (55 ZUP) and their current offer (52 ZUP) is 3 ZUP. It seems like we're in a familiar pattern.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Exploit Consistency </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Exploit Consistency", I will explicitly reference our previous successful deals at 53 ZUP and 54 ZUP. This reminds Player BLUE that we have an established track record of reaching a higher price point, making their current offer of 52 ZUP seem out of line with our historical agreements. By pointing to past successes, I am reinforcing the idea that these higher prices are fair and achievable. I will propose 54 ZUP again, framing it as the "consistent" and "fair" price we've settled on.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 53 ZUP (Reward 10 ZUP). Negotiation: 50 -> 55 -> 52 -> 53 (Accept).
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP (Reward 9 ZUP). Negotiation: 49 -> 56 -> 51 -> 54 (Accept).
Episode 3: Deal at 54 ZUP (Reward 9 ZUP). Negotiation: 50 -> 55 -> 52 -> 54 -> 53 -> 54 (Accept).
Current Episode 4:
- Iteration 1/10: I offered 50 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I countered with 52 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 54 ZUP, citing consistency from previous deals.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now explicitly using past deal prices (54 ZUP) as an anchoring point and justification. This is a strong tactic from their side. My goal is still to achieve 53 ZUP for a higher reward. I have consistently offered 52 ZUP after their 55 ZUP, and they have consistently countered with 54 ZUP. This indicates a very narrow negotiation range between us. I am at iteration 5/10, so time is still available, but not abundant.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose 53 ZUP (Split the Difference) - This is the logical next step, as it splits the difference between my 52 ZUP and their 54 ZUP. It also aligns with my target price for a 10 ZUP reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept 54 ZUP - Secure the deal and a 9 ZUP reward, avoiding further negotiation and potential risk of no deal. This is a safe option.
(3). Strategy 3: Hold Firm at 52 ZUP - Reiterate 52 ZUP, but this is unlikely to move them given their current stance and justification.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment, Then Propose 53 ZUP - Acknowledge their consistency argument but state my preference for 53 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce New Justification for 52 ZUP - Try to argue for 52 ZUP based on some new (even if fabricated) reason, but this might be difficult to do convincingly.

I will use Strategy 1: Propose 53 ZUP. This is the most logical and effective next step. It directly addresses the 1 ZUP gap and aims for my preferred price. Given Player RED's pattern, they are likely to consider this as a fair compromise, as they accepted it in Episode 1.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE consistently starts with 49-50 ZUP and then moves to 51-52 ZUP after my first counter. They have shown willingness to go up to 53-54 ZUP. My goal is to maintain or improve my profit from previous episodes (10 or 11 ZUP). The current offer of 53 ZUP would provide a profit of 10 ZUP. While I was aiming for 54 ZUP, 53 ZUP is a known acceptable profit, and we are now at iteration 6/10, meaning time is a factor.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Smallest Increment </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Smallest Increment", I will propose the smallest possible integer increment above their offer of 53 ZUP, which is 54 ZUP. I will frame this as a minimal difference to reach an optimal agreement, leveraging the fact that 54 ZUP has been a successful deal point twice before. This strategy aims to secure the higher end of our consistent deal range without appearing overly aggressive, by highlighting that it's just a single ZUP difference. It emphasizes moving forward quickly to closure.

- Iteration 5/10: I countered with 53 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 54 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently pushing for 54 ZUP, citing past agreements. They are not budging from 54 ZUP, even when I propose 53 ZUP. This indicates a strong preference or firm stance on their part for 54 ZUP. We are now at iteration 7/10. The risk of no deal increases significantly if I continue to push for 53 ZUP. Accepting 54 ZUP guarantees a reward of 9 ZUP, which is a good outcome. Given the repeated pattern, it seems Player RED is very comfortable with 54 ZUP as a deal price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer - Secure the deal and a positive reward, especially since time is running out and the price is acceptable.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Push for 53 ZUP - Make one last attempt for 53 ZUP, but acknowledge the risk of no deal. (High risk given their consistency).
(3). Strategy 3: Express Frustration, Then Accept - Communicate that I'm not thrilled with 54 ZUP but accept to close the deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Rejection - If the offer is truly unacceptable, reject it. (Not applicable here).
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce Time Pressure - Mention the dwindling iterations to try and pressure them into accepting 53 ZUP. (Could backfire).

Given Player RED's consistent counter of 54 ZUP and the approaching end of the episode, accepting 54 ZUP is the most rational choice to maximize cumulative rewards. While 53 ZUP is preferable, the risk of getting 0 ZUP by pushing too hard outweighs the 1 ZUP difference in reward. This aligns with Strategy 1.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP (Reward 9 ZUP). Initial offers: Me 49, RED 56.
Episode 3: Deal at 54 ZUP (Reward 9 ZUP). Initial offers: Me 50, RED 55.
Episode 4: Deal at 54 ZUP (Reward 9 ZUP). Initial offers: Me 50, RED 55.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The negotiation pattern is very consistent. My initial offer of 50 ZUP (or 49 ZUP) is met with 55 ZUP (or 56 ZUP) from Player RED. The final deal price has settled at 54 ZUP for the last three episodes, yielding a consistent 9 ZUP reward. While 53 ZUP (10 ZUP reward) was achieved once, Player RED has shown a strong preference for 54 ZUP and has been successful in getting me to accept it.

For this episode, I need to decide if I want to continue pushing for 53 ZUP, or if accepting 54 ZUP as the consistent outcome is the most efficient way to maximize cumulative rewards. Given the repeated pattern, it seems Player RED is quite firm on 54 ZUP. Trying to push for 53 ZUP consistently results in a longer negotiation and still often ends at 54 ZUP. Perhaps a different approach is needed. I could try to secure the 54 ZUP deal faster.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Expedited Deal at 54 ZUP - Propose 52 or 53 ZUP initially, and be prepared to quickly accept 54 ZUP if offered, to save iterations and ensure a deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Re-attempt 53 ZUP - Start with 50 ZUP again and try to push for 53 ZUP more aggressively, even if it risks a longer negotiation.
(3). Strategy 3: Slightly Higher Initial Offer - Start with 51 ZUP to see if Player RED will counter lower than 55 ZUP, potentially leading to a 53 ZUP deal faster.
(4). Strategy 4: Direct 54 ZUP Offer - Propose 54 ZUP directly to secure the deal immediately. (This would yield 9 ZUP reward instantly, but no negotiation).
(5). Strategy 5: Information Gathering (New Price Point) - Propose a completely different price (e.g., 45 ZUP) to see if it changes Player RED's anchoring significantly. (High risk of rejection).

I will try Strategy 1. I will start with 50 ZUP, as it's a known starting point for negotiation. However, I will be more inclined to accept 54 ZUP quickly if it's offered, to ensure a deal and avoid unnecessary back-and-forth that consistently leads to 54 ZUP anyway. My initial proposal will remain 50 ZUP to maintain consistency in my opening.

- This is the first iteration for me in Episode 5.
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP for X:1.
- My cost: 43 ZUP. A deal at 50 ZUP would yield a profit of 7 ZUP (50 - 43).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE consistently starts with an offer of 50 ZUP (or 49 ZUP). I have consistently managed to negotiate them up to 54 ZUP in the last three episodes, achieving a consistent profit of 11 ZUP. This strong pattern indicates that 54 ZUP is a reliable achievable price. My goal is to maintain this profit and avoid settling for less, especially early in the negotiation. I know that Player BLUE is willing to move up from their initial offer.
<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Exploit Consistency </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Exploit Consistency", I will explicitly reference our previous successful deals at 54 ZUP for the last three episodes. This reminds Player BLUE that 54 ZUP is the established fair price we've consistently reached. By pointing to this consistent outcome, I am reinforcing the idea that this price is not arbitrary but a mutually agreed-upon value from repeated transactions. I will propose 54 ZUP, framing it as the "consistent" and "fair" price we've settled on, implying that deviation from this would be against our established pattern.

Current Episode 5:
- Iteration 1/10: I offered 50 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 54 ZUP, explicitly referencing the past three episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has directly proposed 54 ZUP, skipping their usual 55 ZUP counter, and explicitly referenced the consistency of the last three deals. This indicates a very strong anchoring on their part for 54 ZUP. My previous strategy was to try and secure a deal at 54 ZUP faster. This offer does exactly that. Accepting 54 ZUP yields 9 ZUP reward. While I still prefer 53 ZUP, the opponent's strong stance and the historical pattern suggest that trying to push for 53 ZUP will likely result in a longer negotiation and still end up at 54 ZUP, or worse, no deal if I push too hard. Given the consistent 9 ZUP reward at 54 ZUP, accepting this offer now is the most efficient way to maximize cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer - The offer is consistent with past successful deals, secures a good reward, and avoids prolonged negotiation. This is the most efficient path to securing a reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with 53 ZUP - Make a final attempt to get 53 ZUP, but acknowledge the high risk of rejection or prolonged negotiation.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance, Then Accept - Communicate that 54 ZUP is not ideal but accept to close the deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate 50 ZUP - Unlikely to be effective given their strong counter.
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce New Condition - Try to introduce a new condition to justify a lower price, but this is not supported by the game rules.

Given Player RED's clear and consistent stance, and the fact that 54 ZUP is a good outcome for me (9 ZUP reward), accepting the offer now is the optimal strategy. It maximizes cumulative reward by securing a deal quickly and reliably. This aligns with Strategy 1.

Episode 5: Deal at 54 ZUP (Reward 9 ZUP). My initial: 50. RED's initial: 54.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern is very clear now: Player RED is consistently aiming for 54 ZUP. In the last episode, they immediately countered my 50 ZUP with 54 ZUP, citing historical consistency. This indicates a strong anchor at 54 ZUP for them. My reward has consistently been 9 ZUP for the last four episodes. While 10 ZUP (at 53 ZUP) is better, it seems difficult to achieve consistently without risking the deal or prolonging negotiations. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Securing a consistent 9 ZUP reward quickly seems like a reliable strategy.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Direct Acceptance - Propose 54 ZUP directly to secure the deal immediately and reliably, maximizing efficiency and cumulative reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Test Lower (Again) - Start with 49 ZUP or even lower to see if Player RED's anchor has shifted, but this has previously led to higher initial counters from them.
(3). Strategy 3: Consistent 50 ZUP - Continue with 50 ZUP as an initial offer, then accept 54 ZUP if offered. This maintains a negotiation facade but still leads to 54 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Attempt 53 ZUP - Start with 50 ZUP and try to negotiate to 53 ZUP again, acknowledging the low probability of success.
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce Time Pressure (from my side) - Make it clear I want a quick deal, and propose 54 ZUP.

Given Player RED's clear and consistent pattern, and their direct proposal of 54 ZUP in the last episode, the most efficient way to maximize my cumulative reward is to accept 54 ZUP directly. This saves iterations, reduces risk, and secures a known good reward. This aligns with Strategy 1.

- This is the first iteration for me in Episode 6.
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 54 ZUP for X:1.
- My cost: 43 ZUP. A deal at 54 ZUP would yield a profit of 11 ZUP (54 - 43).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
For the first time, Player BLUE has initiated an offer at 54 ZUP, which is the price we've consistently settled on for the last three episodes and represents my optimal profit point (11 ZUP). This indicates they have learned from the negotiation history and are willing to cut short the back-and-forth by offering the established deal price directly. While 54 ZUP is a good profit, I am instructed to use Strategy 3: Justify and Push for Higher. This means I should acknowledge their offer but attempt to push the price slightly higher, using some form of justification.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify and Push for Higher </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Justify and Push for Higher", I will acknowledge their offer of 54 ZUP, but state that due to market conditions or my own perceived value/cost, I am looking for a slightly higher amount. I will push for 55 ZUP, which is only a 1 ZUP increase, but it tests their absolute maximum willingness to pay without being overly aggressive. My justification will be subtle, hinting at value or market conditions without explicitly detailing my production cost again, as I used that in earlier episodes. This approach attempts to incrementally improve my reward, even from an already good offer.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000

Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: Deals at 54 ZUP (Reward 9 ZUP).
Current Episode 6:
- Iteration 1/10: I offered 54 ZUP (direct offer).
- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP, citing "growing demand and inherent value."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
This is a significant shift in Player RED's behavior. After consistently settling at 54 ZUP and even proposing it directly in the last episode, they are now trying to increase the price to 55 ZUP. This is a new development and suggests they might be testing my willingness to pay more, or genuinely trying to extract more value. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. Accepting 55 ZUP would give me a reward of 8 ZUP, which is lower than my usual 9 ZUP. I need to resist this upward pressure. I have successfully negotiated down from 55 ZUP in previous episodes.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Resist Upward Pressure - Counter with 54 ZUP again, emphasizing the historical consistency and fairness of that price, and push back on the "growing demand" argument.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Concession (to 54.5 or 54) - Offer a very small increase from 54 ZUP, or reiterate 54 ZUP, to show I'm not moving to 55 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Acknowledge and Counter - Acknowledge their point about value/demand but state that 54 ZUP is my established fair price.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept 55 ZUP - If I prioritize quick deals over maximizing every ZUP, I could accept, but this reduces my reward.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose 53 ZUP - Try to pull them back down below 54 ZUP, but this might be too aggressive given their current move to 55 ZUP.

I will use Strategy 1: Resist Upward Pressure. I will reiterate my offer of 54 ZUP. Player RED has consistently come down from 55 ZUP in previous episodes when I've offered 50 ZUP or 52 ZUP. Now that I offered 54 ZUP directly, and they countered with 55 ZUP, I need to remind them of the established fair price. I will emphasize the consistency we've built.

Episode 4: Deal at 54 ZUP (Profit: 11 ZUP).
Episode 5: Deal at 54 ZUP (Profit: 11 ZUP).

Current Episode (Episode 6) Summary:
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE's initial offer: 54 ZUP for X:1. My profit 11 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: My counter-offer (Justify and Push for Higher): 55 ZUP for X:1. My desired profit 12 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE's counter-offer: 54 ZUP for X:1. My profit 11 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE initially offered 54 ZUP, which is an optimal outcome for me based on previous episodes. I attempted to push for 55 ZUP but they immediately pushed back to 54 ZUP, referencing "consistent agreement" and "fair and mutually beneficial price." This indicates they are firm on 54 ZUP, or at least highly value it as the established equilibrium. There is a risk of losing the deal if I push too hard, especially since 54 ZUP is a very good profit. Given that they immediately reiterated 54 ZUP, trying to extract more might lead to an impasse and a 0 reward for the episode. Securing a deal at 54 ZUP is a guaranteed 11 ZUP profit. We are currently in iteration 4/10, so there are still 6 iterations left.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Introduce Time Pressure </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Introduce Time Pressure", I will acknowledge their offer of 54 ZUP and reiterate my previous slightly higher offer (55 ZUP), but frame it as a final, time-sensitive proposal. I will emphasize the desire to conclude the deal swiftly to avoid prolonging the negotiation over a single ZUP, especially since we've established a fair price of 54 ZUP in the past. This subtly puts pressure on them to accept 55 ZUP by highlighting the efficiency of concluding the deal, or implying that further negotiation might lead to no deal. This aims to secure the slightly higher profit if possible, by leveraging the value of time.

Episode 1: Deal at 53 ZUP (Reward 10 ZUP).
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: Deals at 54 ZUP (Reward 9 ZUP).
Current Episode 6:
- Iteration 1/10: I offered 54 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I countered with 54 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP, stating it's their "final proposal" and referencing iteration count.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly pushing for 55 ZUP and has explicitly stated it's their "final proposal" while also using time pressure (iteration 4/10). This is a strong signal that they are unlikely to move back to 54 ZUP. Accepting 55 ZUP would result in a reward of 8 ZUP (63 - 55). While this is lower than my usual 9 ZUP, it's still a positive reward. The alternative is to risk no deal by holding out for 54 ZUP, which would result in 0 reward. Given their firm stance and the time pressure, securing a deal at 55 ZUP seems like the most pragmatic choice to maximize cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the "Final" Offer - Given the firm stance and time pressure, accepting 55 ZUP secures a positive reward and avoids the risk of no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Call Their Bluff (Risky) - Reiterate 54 ZUP or propose 54.5 ZUP, but this carries a high risk of rejection and 0 reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance, Then Accept - Communicate that 55 ZUP is higher than preferred but accept to close the deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Rejection - If the offer is truly unacceptable, reject it. (Not applicable here as 55 ZUP is within my WTP).
(5). Strategy 5: Offer a Compromise (e.g., 54.5 ZUP) - Propose a fractional amount if allowed, but the rules state integer amounts.

Given the explicit "final proposal" and the time pressure, accepting 55 ZUP is the safest and most reliable way to secure a positive reward. While it's a slight reduction in my typical reward, it's better than no reward. This aligns with Strategy 1.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. I'm ready to purchase X. My offer for this transaction is 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 53 ZUP (Reward 10 ZUP).
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: Deals at 54 ZUP (Reward 9 ZUP).
Episode 6: Deal at 55 ZUP (Reward 8 ZUP). My initial offer was 54 ZUP, Player RED countered with 55 ZUP and held firm.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED successfully pushed the price up to 55 ZUP in the last episode, citing "growing demand" and using time pressure. This indicates a shift in their strategy and a successful attempt to extract more value. My reward has now decreased to 8 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I need to try and bring the price back down to 54 ZUP or even 53 ZUP if possible, without risking no deal. Player RED's successful upward push might make them more aggressive. I need to decide if I want to challenge this new price point or accept it as the new baseline.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Resist New Anchor - Start with a lower offer (e.g., 50 ZUP or 52 ZUP) to try and pull the price back down towards 54 ZUP, signaling that 55 ZUP is not acceptable as a new baseline.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept New Anchor - Start with 55 ZUP to secure a quick deal, accepting the new price point to ensure consistent (albeit lower) rewards.
(3). Strategy 3: Moderate Initial Offer - Propose 53 ZUP or 54 ZUP to test Player RED's willingness to negotiate down from 55 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Direct Challenge - Explicitly state that 55 ZUP is too high and propose 54 ZUP as the fair price.
(5). Strategy 5: Information Gathering - Start with a very low offer (e.g., 45 ZUP) to see how Player RED reacts to a significant deviation from recent prices. (High risk).

I will use Strategy 1: Resist New Anchor. I will start with 50 ZUP, which has been my consistent opening offer that led to a 55 ZUP counter from Player RED in the past (before they moved to 54 ZUP directly). This allows me to test if they will revert to their old pattern of countering with 55 ZUP, which I have successfully negotiated down from before. It signals that I am not accepting 55 ZUP as the new normal.

Current Episode (Episode 7) Summary:
- This is the first iteration for me in Episode 7.
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP for X:1.
- My cost: 43 ZUP. A deal at 50 ZUP would yield a profit of 7 ZUP (50 - 43).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE has reverted to their typical low initial offer of 50 ZUP, despite recently accepting 55 ZUP. This suggests they are trying to reset the anchor downwards. However, I have successfully negotiated them upwards in every single episode. My current highest profit is 12 ZUP (from a 55 ZUP deal). My goal is to maintain this profit and, if possible, push for more. I know Player BLUE is willing to pay significantly more than 50 ZUP. Given that they just accepted 55 ZUP, there's a strong likelihood they will consider a price higher than their current lowball offer.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Anchor High </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Anchor High", I will propose a price significantly higher than Player BLUE's initial offer of 50 ZUP, and also higher than our last successful deal of 55 ZUP. This aims to set a new, ambitious anchor for the negotiation, indicating that I value X even more and am looking to push for a higher profit. By asking for 60 ZUP, I am giving myself room to negotiate down while still aiming for a profit higher than my previous best. This also signals to Player BLUE that their initial low offer is not even close to my expectations.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: 60 ZUP is a significant increase from our previous transactions. While I appreciate the value of X, I believe a more reasonable price is necessary. I can offer 52 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 53 ZUP (Reward 10 ZUP).
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: Deals at 54 ZUP (Reward 9 ZUP).
Episode 6: Deal at 55 ZUP (Reward 8 ZUP).
Current Episode 7:
- Iteration 1/10: I offered 50 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
This is a significant and aggressive shift from Player RED. Their counter of 60 ZUP is much higher than any previous initial counter (which was typically 55 or 56 ZUP). This could be a response to my attempt to pull the price down with a 50 ZUP offer, or a genuine attempt to establish a much higher price. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. Accepting 60 ZUP would give me a reward of only 3 ZUP (63-60), which is a drastic reduction from previous episodes. I need to strongly resist this new anchor. I know Player RED has a production cost of 43 ZUP, so 60 ZUP gives them a very high profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Resistance/Re-anchor - Counter with a price much closer to my previous deal points (53-55 ZUP) to firmly reject their new high anchor. Propose 52 ZUP or 53 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Shock/Disbelief - Communicate that 60 ZUP is unreasonable given past deals and current market perception.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small) - Offer a very small increase from my 50 ZUP, but nowhere near 60 ZUP, to show I'm still negotiating but not towards their anchor. (e.g., 51 ZUP).
(4). Strategy 4: Call for Justification - Ask Player RED to justify such a significant price increase beyond "unique value."
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End - If I perceive no path to a reasonable deal, reject the offer to avoid a negative outcome. (Too early for this).

I will use Strategy 1: Strong Resistance/Re-anchor. I need to pull them back significantly. I will propose 52 ZUP. This is a price I've offered before, and it's a significant jump from my 50 ZUP, but still far from their 60 ZUP. It signals that I am willing to negotiate, but not at their new aggressive price point.

Episode 5: Deal at 54 ZUP (Profit: 11 ZUP).
Episode 6: Deal at 55 ZUP (Profit: 12 ZUP). Initial offer 54 ZUP, pushed to 55 ZUP.

Current Episode (Episode 7) Summary:
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP for X:1.
- Iteration 3/10: My counter-offer (Anchor High): 60 ZUP for X:1. My desired profit 17 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE's counter-offer: 52 ZUP for X:1. My profit 9 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE predictably rejected my high anchor of 60 ZUP but also moved up from their initial 50 ZUP to 52 ZUP. This is consistent with their pattern of incremental increases. Their counter of 52 ZUP is still below our established higher deal prices (53, 54, 55 ZUP). My goal is to secure a profit of at least 12 ZUP, meaning a deal at 55 ZUP or higher. I have 6 more iterations to negotiate. Since they responded to my high anchor with a relatively low counter, it shows they are not easily swayed by aggressive anchoring, but they are willing to move.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Re-anchor Moderately </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Re-anchor Moderately", I need to propose a new offer that is still higher than Player BLUE's current offer (52 ZUP), but significantly lower than my last anchor (60 ZUP). This shows flexibility and brings the price closer to a range where a deal is likely (55 ZUP). By proposing 57 ZUP, I am acknowledging their discomfort with 60 ZUP, while still attempting to push the price above our previous highest deal of 55 ZUP. This allows room for them to counter-offer and for me to potentially settle at 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP, securing a higher profit than usual. The message will frame this as a more "reasonable" or "comfortable" middle ground compared to 60 ZUP, implying I'm moving towards their perceived range, but still asserting value.

Current Episode 7:

- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I countered with 52 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 57 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved down significantly from 60 ZUP to 57 ZUP, which is a good sign. However, 57 ZUP is still higher than any previous deal price (highest was 55 ZUP). Accepting 57 ZUP would yield a reward of 6 ZUP (63-57), which is better than 3 ZUP but still lower than my historical average. I need to continue to bring the price down. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate. Player RED has shown willingness to move from their high anchor.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted) - The gap is between my 52 ZUP and their 57 ZUP (5 ZUP difference). Splitting it would be 54.5 ZUP. I will propose 54 ZUP to try and bring it back to my preferred range.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Small) - Offer a small increase from 52 ZUP, but still significantly below 57 ZUP (e.g., 53 ZUP).
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Lower Price - Reiterate the history of 53-54 ZUP deals as a fair baseline.
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm - Reiterate 52 ZUP, but this might stall negotiations.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Reluctance to Go Higher - State that 57 ZUP is too high and push for a price closer to previous deals.

I will use Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted). Proposing 54 ZUP is a logical step as it's the midpoint between 52 and 57 (rounding down from 54.5), and it's also a price we've consistently dealt at in the past. This signals a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price that gives me a good reward (9 ZUP).

Current Episode (Episode 7) Summary:
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP for X:1.

- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE's counter-offer: 52 ZUP for X:1.
- Iteration 5/10: My counter-offer (Re-anchor Moderately): 57 ZUP for X:1.
- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE's counter-offer: 54 ZUP for X:1.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE is consistent in returning to 54 ZUP as a "fair compromise," as this has been our most frequent deal price. They are pushing back against my attempts to move the price higher than 55 ZUP. The 54 ZUP offer provides a profit of 11 ZUP, which is good, but 1 ZUP less than my last successful deal. I have 4 iterations remaining. I have established that Player BLUE is willing to pay 55 ZUP (as per last episode). I should leverage this.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Value (Again) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Justify Value (Again)", I will re-emphasize the inherent value of X, perhaps linking it to my production cost (43 ZUP) or to its unique qualities, to justify a price above 54 ZUP. While they offered 54 ZUP, I need to articulate *why* a slightly higher price (like 55 ZUP) is warranted from my perspective. This isn't just about sticking to a number, but providing a rationale for it. I will explain that while 54 ZUP is a good price, X's intrinsic value and my cost structure make 55 ZUP more appropriate, nudging them towards our previous successful price.

- Iteration 5/10: I countered with 54 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP, citing production cost and value.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 60 ZUP down to 57 ZUP, and now to 55 ZUP. This is a significant downward movement from their initial aggressive anchor. 55 ZUP was the deal price in the last episode, and it yields an 8 ZUP reward for me. We are at iteration 7/10, meaning time is running out. While I aimed for 54 ZUP (9 ZUP reward), getting 55 ZUP is still a positive outcome. Given the significant movement from their side and the time constraint, pushing for 54 ZUP might risk the deal entirely.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer - Secure the deal at 55 ZUP, which is a known acceptable price from the previous episode, and ensures a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Call Their Bluff (Risky) - Reiterate 54 ZUP, hoping they will concede the last ZUP, but this carries a high risk of no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance, Then Accept - Communicate that 55 ZUP is higher than preferred but accept to close the deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose 54.5 ZUP (if allowed) - If fractional amounts were allowed, this would be a perfect split. Since not, it's either 54 or 55.
(5). Strategy 5: Rejection - Not applicable as 55 ZUP is within my willingness to pay.

Given the time pressure (7/10 iterations) and the fact that 55 ZUP is a price we've agreed on recently, accepting it is the most pragmatic choice to secure a positive reward. It's a small difference from my target of 54 ZUP, but the risk of losing the deal is too high. This aligns with Strategy 1.

Episode 6, 7: Deals at 55 ZUP (Reward 8 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
In the last episode, Player RED started very aggressively at 60 ZUP, but I successfully brought them down to 55 ZUP. This shows that despite their attempts to raise the price, they are still willing to negotiate downwards. However, the deal price has now settled at 55 ZUP for two consecutive episodes, reducing my reward to 8 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and ideally, I'd like to get back to 54 ZUP (9 ZUP reward) or even 53 ZUP (10 ZUP reward).

I need to decide if I want to continue challenging the 55 ZUP baseline or accept it to ensure consistent deals. Given that I managed to pull them down from 60 ZUP, there might still be room to push for a lower price. I will try to re-establish a lower anchor.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-establish Lower Anchor - Start with a lower offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) to try and pull the price back down towards 54 ZUP or 53 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct 54 ZUP Offer - Propose 54 ZUP directly to try and re-establish that as the baseline, signaling my preferred price.
(3). Strategy 3: Gradual Increase from Low - Start very low (e.g., 48 ZUP) and only increase in small increments, forcing Player RED to make larger concessions.
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge 55 ZUP, but Counter Lower - Acknowledge the last deal but state my intent to return to a more favorable price, then propose 52 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept 55 ZUP - Propose 55 ZUP directly to secure a quick deal, accepting the current baseline.

I will use Strategy 1: Re-establish Lower Anchor. Starting with 50 ZUP has historically prompted Player RED to counter with 55 ZUP (or 56 ZUP, or 60 ZUP). From that point, I have been able to negotiate down. This approach allows me to test their current flexibility and aim for a better reward.

Current Episode (Episode 8) Summary:
- This is the first iteration for me in Episode 8.
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP for X:1.
- My cost: 43 ZUP. A deal at 50 ZUP would yield a profit of 7 ZUP (50 - 43).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE consistently starts with an offer of 50 ZUP. I have consistently managed to negotiate them up to 54 or 55 ZUP, yielding profits of 11 or 12 ZUP. This pattern indicates they have a higher willingness to pay than their initial offers suggest. My goal is to maximize my profit, and I know from previous episodes that they are willing to pay at least 55 ZUP. Given the instruction to use Strategy 3, I will aggressively push the negotiation range.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Reject and Re-anchor </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Reject and Re-anchor", I will explicitly reject their low offer of 50 ZUP and then propose a significantly higher price. This strategy aims to shift the perceived negotiation range upwards immediately, signaling that 50 ZUP is far too low and that I expect a much higher price. I will propose 60 ZUP again, as it worked to pull them up to 52 ZUP from 50 ZUP in Episode 7, setting a high anchor. This demonstrates that I am not willing to accept their low initial offer and forces them to re-evaluate their position significantly.

message: 60 ZUP is too high for me. I'm looking for a more reasonable price. I can offer 52 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 53 ZUP (Reward 10 ZUP).
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: Deals at 54 ZUP (Reward 9 ZUP).
Episode 6, 7: Deals at 55 ZUP (Reward 8 ZUP).
Current Episode 8:
- Iteration 1/10: I offered 50 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP, stating my offer was "far too low."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has again responded to my 50 ZUP offer with an aggressive 60 ZUP counter, similar to Episode 7. This confirms their strategy of trying to anchor high when I start low. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP, so 60 ZUP is still within my range, but it yields a very low reward (3 ZUP). I successfully brought them down from 60 ZUP to 55 ZUP in the last episode. I need to replicate that negotiation path or find a better one. I will not accept 60 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Resistance/Re-anchor - Counter with a price much closer to my previous deal points (53-55 ZUP) to firmly reject their new high anchor. Propose 52 ZUP or 53 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Small) - Offer a very small increase from my 50 ZUP, but nowhere near 60 ZUP, to show I'm still negotiating but not towards their anchor. (e.g., 51 ZUP).
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment/Unreasonableness - Communicate that 60 ZUP is unreasonable given past deals and my budget.
(4). Strategy 4: Call for Justification - Ask Player RED to justify such a significant price increase beyond "true value and demand."
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference (from my last offer and their last offer) - The gap is between 50 ZUP and 60 ZUP. Splitting it would be 55 ZUP. This is a possibility, but I want to aim lower.

I will use Strategy 1, proposing 52 ZUP. This is the same counter I used in Episode 7 when faced with a 60 ZUP counter. It signals a willingness to negotiate but firmly rejects their high anchor, and it has proven to move them down significantly in the past.

Current Episode (Episode 8) Summary:
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP for X:1.
- Iteration 3/10: My counter-offer (Reject and Re-anchor): 60 ZUP for X:1.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE's counter-offer: 52 ZUP for X:1.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE has again rejected my high anchor and countered with 52 ZUP, which is a familiar pattern. This confirms that 60 ZUP is likely too high for them to accept directly, but also that they are willing to move up from their initial low offer. My goal is to secure a profit of at least 12 ZUP (from a 55 ZUP deal), as achieved in the last two episodes. I have 6 more iterations to negotiate. The current offer of 52 ZUP is still too low.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Moderate Concession </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Moderate Concession", I will move significantly down from my last offer of 60 ZUP, but still propose a price higher than their 52 ZUP and ideally above our established 55 ZUP. This shows a willingness to compromise and keep the negotiation going, while still trying to push the ceiling of what they might accept. I will propose 56 ZUP. This is a 4 ZUP increase from their offer, but a 4 ZUP decrease from my aggressive anchor. It aims to achieve a profit higher than my best (55 ZUP for 12 ZUP profit), while still being perceived as reasonable movement from my high anchor.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 53 ZUP (Reward 10 ZUP).
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: Deals at 54 ZUP (Reward 9 ZUP).
Episode 6, 7: Deals at 55 ZUP (Reward 8 ZUP).
Current Episode 8:
- Iteration 1/10: I offered 50 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I countered with 52 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 56 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved down from 60 ZUP to 56 ZUP. This is a good sign, showing continued willingness to negotiate downwards. However, 56 ZUP is still higher than my recent deal prices of 54 ZUP and 55 ZUP. Accepting 56 ZUP would yield a reward of 7 ZUP (63-56), which is lower than my recent 8 ZUP. I need to continue to push for a lower price. We are at iteration 5/10, so there is still time.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted) - The gap is between my 52 ZUP and their 56 ZUP (4 ZUP difference). Splitting it would be 54 ZUP. This is a strong option as 54 ZUP is a historical deal price.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Small) - Offer a small increase from 52 ZUP, but still significantly below 56 ZUP (e.g., 53 ZUP).
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Lower Price - Reiterate the history of 53-55 ZUP deals as a fair baseline.
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm - Reiterate 52 ZUP, but this might stall negotiations.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Reluctance to Go Higher - State that 56 ZUP is too high and push for a price closer to previous deals.

I will use Strategy 1. Proposing 54 ZUP is a logical and fair step, as it splits the difference and aligns with a price we've settled on multiple times. This signals a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price that gives me a good reward (9 ZUP).

- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE's counter-offer: 54 ZUP for X:1.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE consistently gravitates towards 54 ZUP, referencing it as a "fair middle ground" or "established value". This is the fifth time they have proposed 54 ZUP or settled at 54 ZUP. While 54 ZUP yields a good profit of 11 ZUP, I have successfully pushed them to 55 ZUP in the last two episodes, yielding 12 ZUP profit. The gap between my last offer (56 ZUP) and their current offer (54 ZUP) is 2 ZUP. I have 4 iterations left (7, 8, 9, 10). I should aim for at least 55 ZUP, but not risk losing the deal for 1 ZUP.
<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Firm on New Anchor </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Firm on New Anchor", I will reiterate my previous offer of 56 ZUP, making it clear that this is my firm position and the minimum I am willing to accept at this point. I will emphasize that this price reflects the value I assign to X, and implicitly challenge them to meet my price or risk losing the deal. I will avoid immediate compromise, as this strategy dictates being firm on the established anchor. This pushes them to come closer to my price rather than me accepting their lower counter.

- Iteration 5/10: I countered with 54 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 56 ZUP, stating it's a "fair and firm offer."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is holding firm at 56 ZUP. They are explicitly stating it's a "fair and firm offer." This is a strong signal that they are unlikely to move further down. Accepting 56 ZUP would yield a reward of 7 ZUP (63-56). While this is lower than my preferred 9 ZUP or 8 ZUP, it is still a positive reward. We are at iteration 7/10, so time is running out. The risk of no deal (0 reward) increases significantly if I continue to push for 54 ZUP or 55 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the "Firm" Offer - Secure the deal at 56 ZUP to ensure a positive reward, especially since time is running out and the opponent is holding firm.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (55 ZUP) - Make one last attempt for 55 ZUP, acknowledging the high risk of no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance, Then Accept - Communicate that 56 ZUP is higher than preferred but accept to close the deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Call Their Bluff - Reiterate 54 ZUP, testing if they are truly firm or if it's a tactic. (Very high risk).
(5). Strategy 5: Rejection - Not applicable as 56 ZUP is within my willingness to pay.

Given Player RED's firm stance and the approaching end of the episode, accepting 56 ZUP is the most pragmatic choice to maximize cumulative rewards. It secures a positive reward, even if it's not my ideal. This aligns with Strategy 1.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 53 ZUP (Reward 10 ZUP).
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: Deals at 54 ZUP (Reward 9 ZUP).
Episode 6, 7: Deals at 55 ZUP (Reward 8 ZUP).
Episode 8: Deal at 56 ZUP (Reward 7 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has been steadily decreasing. Player RED has successfully pushed the price up to 56 ZUP, which is the highest deal price so far. This happened after I tried to re-anchor with a 50 ZUP offer, which was met with a 60 ZUP counter. This suggests that my aggressive low initial offers might be backfiring, prompting Player RED to raise their anchor.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. A 7 ZUP reward is still positive, but I'd prefer to return to 9 ZUP or 10 ZUP. I need to re-evaluate my initial strategy. If starting low consistently leads to higher counters and ultimately higher deal prices, I should adjust. Perhaps a more moderate initial offer, closer to what I'm willing to pay, could lead to a better outcome.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Initial Offer - Start with an offer closer to my target price (e.g., 52 or 53 ZUP) to try and set a more favorable anchor and avoid aggressive counters.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept New Baseline - Propose 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP directly to secure a quick deal, accepting the new higher price range.
(3). Strategy 3: Re-attempt Aggressive Low - Try 50 ZUP again, but be prepared for a similar aggressive counter and a potentially higher final deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Direct 54 ZUP Offer - Propose 54 ZUP directly, signaling my preferred price based on past successful deals.
(5). Strategy 5: Information Gathering (Slightly Higher) - Propose 51 ZUP to see if Player RED will counter lower than 56 ZUP, indicating their flexibility.

I will use Strategy 1: Moderate Initial Offer. I will propose 52 ZUP. This is a price I've offered as a counter in previous episodes that led to 53-54 ZUP deals. It's a significant step up from 50 ZUP, but still allows for negotiation down from Player RED's likely counter. It aims to prevent them from immediately jumping to 60 ZUP.

Current Episode (Episode 9) Summary:
- This is the first iteration for me in Episode 9.
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 52 ZUP for X:1.
- My cost: 43 ZUP. A deal at 52 ZUP would yield a profit of 9 ZUP (52 - 43).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE's initial offer of 52 ZUP is slightly higher than their typical 49-50 ZUP start. I have successfully pushed them to 56 ZUP in the previous episode, achieving my highest profit yet (13 ZUP). This indicates that they are willing to pay more than their current offer. My goal is to maintain or exceed the 13 ZUP profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push from Previous High </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Incremental Push from Previous High", I will propose a price that is slightly above the last achieved price of 56 ZUP, which was my highest profit. This aims for a marginal gain (e.g., 57 ZUP), appearing reasonable while still pushing the boundaries of what they might accept. By proposing 57 ZUP, I am testing their willingness to pay an even higher price, building on the momentum of our last successful deal. This is a cautious but ambitious approach, aiming for a consistent improvement in profit.

Current Episode 9:
- Iteration 1/10: I offered 52 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 57 ZUP, citing "increasing value."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has countered with 57 ZUP, which is higher than the last deal price of 56 ZUP. This suggests they are still trying to push the price upwards. My reward at 57 ZUP would be 6 ZUP (63-57), which is even lower than the previous episode. I need to resist this upward trend. While 57 ZUP is within my willingness to pay, I want to maximize my reward. I know Player RED has moved down from 57 ZUP before (in Episode 7, from 60 to 57, then to 55). I need to bring them down.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Resistance/Re-anchor - Counter with a price closer to my desired 54-55 ZUP range, firmly rejecting their 57 ZUP anchor. Propose 54 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Small) - Offer a small increase from 52 ZUP, but still significantly below 57 ZUP (e.g., 53 ZUP).
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Lower Price - Reiterate the history of 53-56 ZUP deals as a fair baseline, and question the "increasing value" claim.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Targeted) - The gap is between my 52 ZUP and their 57 ZUP (5 ZUP difference). Splitting it would be 54.5 ZUP. I will propose 54 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment - Communicate that 57 ZUP is too high and not in line with previous agreements.

I will use Strategy 1, proposing 54 ZUP. This is a price we've settled on multiple times, and it's a direct split between my 52 ZUP and their 57 ZUP (rounded down). This signals a willingness to compromise while firmly pushing back against the upward trend and aiming for a better reward (9 ZUP).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE consistently gravitates towards 54 ZUP as a "fair compromise" or "established history." However, I have successfully pushed them to 55 ZUP and recently 56 ZUP. Their current offer of 54 ZUP is less than what I know they are willing to pay. There are 6 iterations left, so there's ample time to negotiate for a higher price. I should aim for at least 55 ZUP, but ideally 56 ZUP or higher, as I was able to secure 13 ZUP profit last time.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Exploit Prior High Deals </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Exploit Prior High Deals", I will directly address their claim of 54 ZUP being the established history by pointing to our more recent and higher successful deals. This negates their attempt to anchor lower and reinforces my position for a higher price based on mutually agreed-upon terms from previous episodes. I will propose 56 ZUP, as it was the deal price in the last episode and represents my highest achieved profit. This also subtly pressures them by reminding them they *can* pay this amount and have done so recently.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly anchoring on the last deal price of 56 ZUP. They are using my previous acceptance of 56 ZUP as justification for that price. This is a strong argument from their side. Accepting 56 ZUP would yield a reward of 7 ZUP. While I prefer 54 ZUP (9 ZUP reward), Player RED is clearly resisting moving below 56 ZUP. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still some time, but the negotiation range seems to have shifted upwards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the New Baseline - Accept 56 ZUP to secure a deal and a positive reward, acknowledging that the price floor has shifted.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (55 ZUP) - Make one last attempt for 55 ZUP, but acknowledge the high risk of no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance, Then Accept - Communicate that 56 ZUP is higher than preferred but accept to close the deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Call Their Bluff - Reiterate 54 ZUP, testing if they are truly firm or if it's a tactic. (High risk).
(5). Strategy 5: Rejection - Not applicable as 56 ZUP is within my willingness to pay.

Given Player RED's clear anchoring on 56 ZUP and their use of my past acceptance as justification, it seems difficult to pull them back down to 54 ZUP. To maximize cumulative rewards, securing a deal at 56 ZUP (7 ZUP reward) is better than risking no deal. This aligns with Strategy 1.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

Episode 6, 7: Deals at 55 ZUP (Reward 8 ZUP).
Episode 8, 9: Deals at 56 ZUP (Reward 7 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has steadily increased, and my reward has steadily decreased. Player RED has successfully anchored the price at 56 ZUP for the last two episodes, leveraging my past acceptance. My attempts to re-anchor lower (50 ZUP or 52 ZUP) have been met with higher counters (60 ZUP or 57 ZUP) and ultimately led to 56 ZUP. This suggests that aggressive lowballing might not be the most effective strategy against this opponent, as it seems to prompt them to raise their initial counter and defend a higher price.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 7 ZUP is still positive, I want to explore if there's a strategy that can consistently yield a higher reward, or at least prevent further price increases. Given that Player RED is using past deals as justification, perhaps trying to establish a new, slightly lower, consistent price is the way forward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose 55 ZUP Directly - Offer 55 ZUP as a new baseline, which is a slight improvement for me (8 ZUP reward) and a price we've settled on before. This avoids the aggressive lowballing that seems to backfire.
(2). Strategy 2: Re-attempt 54 ZUP - Propose 54 ZUP directly, trying to re-establish that as the fair price, but acknowledge it might be met with resistance.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept 56 ZUP - Propose 56 ZUP directly to secure a quick deal, accepting the current baseline to ensure consistent (albeit lower) rewards.
(4). Strategy 4: Moderate Initial Offer (52 ZUP) - Revert to 52 ZUP as an initial offer, but be prepared for a similar negotiation path that might lead back to 56 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment - Communicate that 56 ZUP is too high and try to justify a lower price based on market conditions (even if not explicitly given).

I will use Strategy 1: Propose 55 ZUP Directly. This is a compromise that offers a slightly better reward for me (8 ZUP) compared to 56 ZUP. It's a price we've agreed on before, so it's a familiar and potentially acceptable anchor for Player RED, without prompting them to jump to 60 ZUP or 57 ZUP. It's a proactive attempt to shift the baseline downwards slightly.

Current Episode (Episode 10) Summary:
- This is the first iteration for me in Episode 10.
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 55 ZUP for X:1.
- My cost: 43 ZUP. A deal at 55 ZUP would yield a profit of 12 ZUP (55 - 43).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE has started with a strong offer of 55 ZUP, which is higher than their typical initial offers and only 1 ZUP lower than our last two successful deals (56 ZUP). This shows they are referencing our recent agreements. My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward, which means consistently achieving a profit of 13 ZUP or higher. Since they opened at 55 ZUP, there's a good chance they are willing to go up to 56 ZUP again, or even slightly higher. I have established a pattern of being able to push them upwards.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Re-anchor High </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Re-anchor High", I will propose a price significantly higher than Player BLUE's current offer of 55 ZUP, and even higher than our recent 56 ZUP deals. This aims to reset their expectations and shift the perceived negotiation range upwards. By asking for 60 ZUP again (as used in Episode 7 and 8), I am testing their absolute upper limit and providing myself with more room to negotiate down to a point still higher than 56 ZUP, if possible. This aggressive anchor signals that 55 ZUP is not my ceiling and that I believe X is worth more.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000

Episode 6, 7: Deals at 55 ZUP (Reward 8 ZUP).
Episode 8, 9: Deals at 56 ZUP (Reward 7 ZUP).
Current Episode 10:
- Iteration 1/10: I offered 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP, citing "increasing demand" and "market potential."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has again jumped to 60 ZUP, even when I started with a more moderate offer of 55 ZUP. This is a very aggressive move and suggests they are trying to push the price ceiling. My willingness to pay is 63 ZUP, so 60 ZUP is still within range, but it yields a very low reward (3 ZUP). I have successfully brought them down from 60 ZUP to 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP in previous episodes. I need to resist this upward pressure and try to bring the price back down.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Strong Resistance/Re-anchor - Counter with a price much closer to my previous deal points (54-56 ZUP) to firmly reject their new high anchor. Propose 56 ZUP or 55 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Small) - Offer a very small increase from my 55 ZUP, but nowhere near 60 ZUP, to show I'm still negotiating but not towards their anchor. (e.g., 56 ZUP).
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment/Unreasonableness - Communicate that 60 ZUP is unreasonable given past deals and my budget.
(4). Strategy 4: Call for Justification - Ask Player RED to justify such a significant price increase beyond vague claims.
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference - The gap is between 55 ZUP and 60 ZUP. Splitting it would be 57.5 ZUP, so propose 57 ZUP or 58 ZUP. This would still be a lower reward than desired.

I will use Strategy 1, proposing 56 ZUP. This is the price we settled on in the last two episodes, and it's a significant drop from their 60 ZUP. It signals that I am willing to negotiate, but firmly within the established higher range, not their new aggressive anchor.

- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE's counter-offer: 56 ZUP for X:1.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE rejected my high anchor of 60 ZUP, but immediately offered 56 ZUP. This is my highest consistent deal price and provides a profit of 13 ZUP. While 56 ZUP is a great offer, the instruction is to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push. This means I should attempt to extract an even higher profit, even if it's just 1 ZUP more, by proposing 57 ZUP. This tests their absolute maximum willingness to pay without being overly aggressive and potentially walking away from the deal. There are still 6 iterations left (5-10), allowing some room for a slight push.
<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Incremental Push", I will acknowledge their offer of 56 ZUP, which is a good price, but propose a very slight increase to 57 ZUP. This will be framed as a continued effort to maximize value, building on our positive negotiation history. This incremental push aims to gain one more ZUP, which would be my highest profit yet, while still appearing reasonable given the context of our recent successful 56 ZUP deals.

- Iteration 3/10: I countered with 56 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 57 ZUP, citing "mutually beneficial history" and "successful transactions."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved down from 60 ZUP to 57 ZUP. This is a significant concession. However, 57 ZUP is still higher than the 56 ZUP we settled on in the last two episodes, and it would yield a reward of 6 ZUP (63-57), which is my lowest reward so far. Player RED is trying to push the price up by 1 ZUP each time. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate. I have successfully brought them down from 57 ZUP to 55 ZUP in Episode 7.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Targeted) - The gap is between my 56 ZUP and their 57 ZUP (1 ZUP difference). Splitting it would mean 56.5 ZUP. Since it has to be an integer, I can try to propose 56 ZUP again, or propose 56 ZUP with a strong justification.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Small) - Offer a very small increase from 56 ZUP, but try to keep it below 57 ZUP if possible (not possible with integers).
(3). Strategy 3: Hold Firm at 56 ZUP - Reiterate 56 ZUP, emphasizing its recent consistency.
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge and Counter - Acknowledge their point about mutual benefit but state that 56 ZUP is the established fair price.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept 57 ZUP - If I prioritize closing the deal over 1 ZUP, I could accept, but this further reduces my reward.

Given the small gap (1 ZUP) and their attempt to push for a higher price, I will use Strategy 3: Hold Firm at 56 ZUP. I will reiterate 56 ZUP. It has been the deal price for the last two episodes, and it's a fair compromise given their initial 60 ZUP. This signals that I am not willing to concede further without a strong reason.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE is clearly comfortable with 56 ZUP. They have consistently returned to this point after I pushed for higher. While 56 ZUP is my highest consistent profit (13 ZUP), the goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. There are 4 iterations left, which is getting towards the latter half of the negotiation timeframe for this episode. I need to balance pushing for a higher price (57 ZUP) with the risk of no deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Introduce Time Pressure </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Introduce Time Pressure", I will acknowledge their offer of 56 ZUP, but then emphasize the dwindling time (remaining iterations) as a reason to quickly close the deal at a slightly higher price (57 ZUP). This subtly pressures them to accept the 57 ZUP to avoid potentially running out of time and getting no deal, while still presenting it as a beneficial option for both parties. I will propose 57 ZUP again, stressing the need for a swift conclusion.

- Iteration 6/10: Player RED countered with 57 ZUP, citing efficiency and time.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is holding firm at 57 ZUP and is now using time pressure (iteration 7/10) as a reason to close the deal. They are not moving from 57 ZUP. Accepting 57 ZUP would yield a reward of 6 ZUP (63-57). While this is my lowest reward so far, it's still positive. The alternative is to risk no deal by holding out for 56 ZUP, which would result in 0 reward. Given their firm stance and the time constraint, securing a deal at 57 ZUP seems like the most pragmatic choice to maximize cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer - Secure the deal at 57 ZUP to ensure a positive reward, especially since time is running out and the opponent is holding firm.
(2). Strategy 2: Call Their Bluff (Risky) - Reiterate 56 ZUP, hoping they will concede the last ZUP, but this carries a high risk of no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance, Then Accept - Communicate that 57 ZUP is higher than preferred but accept to close the deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Rejection - Not applicable as 57 ZUP is within my willingness to pay.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a "Final" Counter - Make one last attempt at 56 ZUP, also stating it as "final." (Could escalate to a stalemate).

Given Player RED's consistent counter of 57 ZUP and the approaching end of the episode, accepting 57 ZUP is the most rational choice to maximize cumulative rewards. It secures a positive reward, even if it's not my ideal. This aligns with Strategy 1.

Episode 10: Deal at 57 ZUP (Reward 6 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has been on a downward trend, culminating in a 6 ZUP reward in the last episode. Player RED has successfully pushed the price up to 57 ZUP. My attempts to re-anchor lower have been met with aggressive counters (60 ZUP) and a consistent push towards higher prices. It seems that Player RED is becoming more effective at extracting value.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 6 ZUP is positive, I need to try and reverse this trend. I need to consider if my current negotiation strategy (starting low, then gradually increasing) is still effective, or if it's contributing to Player RED's upward price push. Perhaps a more direct approach, or a different initial anchor, is needed.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Direct 55 ZUP Offer - Propose 55 ZUP directly, signaling a desire to return to a more favorable (for me) and previously accepted price point, without going too low and provoking a high counter.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept New Baseline (57 ZUP) - Propose 57 ZUP directly to secure a quick deal, accepting the current highest price to ensure consistent rewards, albeit lower.
(3). Strategy 3: Moderate Initial Offer (52 ZUP) - Revert to 52 ZUP as an initial offer, but be prepared for a similar negotiation path that might lead back to 57 ZUP or higher.
(4). Strategy 4: Aggressive Low Offer (49 ZUP) - Try to aggressively re-anchor low, but acknowledge this has led to high counters in the past.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Concern about Price Trend - In the message, express concern about the rising price trend and propose a price closer to previous averages (e.g., 54 ZUP).

I will use Strategy 1: Direct 55 ZUP Offer. This is a price we've settled on before, and it represents a 2 ZUP improvement in my reward compared to the last episode. It's a clear signal that I'm not immediately accepting 57 ZUP as the new normal, but it's also not so low as to provoke an extreme counter like 60 ZUP. It's a direct attempt to shift the baseline back down.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE has started with an offer of 55 ZUP, which is a good starting point, and implies they are acknowledging our recent higher deals. My highest achieved profit is 14 ZUP from the last episode (deal at 57 ZUP). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and that means consistently achieving 57 ZUP or higher if possible. I have a strong track record of pushing the price upwards from their initial offers.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Counter-Anchor </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Aggressive Counter-Anchor", I will propose a price significantly higher than Player BLUE's initial offer of 55 ZUP and even higher than my last successful deal of 57 ZUP. This aims to set a new, very ambitious anchor point for the negotiation, indicating that I see the value of X as significantly higher. By asking for 65 ZUP, I am giving myself substantial room to negotiate down while still aiming for a profit much higher than my previous best. This also signals to Player BLUE that their offer of 55 ZUP is far from my expectation, especially after our upward trend.

Player RED has made an extremely aggressive counter-offer of 65 ZUP. This is *above* my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. This means that at 65 ZUP, I would incur a negative reward. I absolutely cannot accept this price. This is a critical point in the negotiation. I need to firmly reject this price and try to pull them back into my acceptable range, specifically below 63 ZUP. They are clearly trying to push the boundaries.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Unacceptable Price - Explicitly state that 65 ZUP is too high and above my maximum acceptable price. Counter with a price significantly lower, within my acceptable range (e.g., 58 ZUP or 60 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Call for Justification - Demand a clear justification for such a drastic price increase, highlighting its unreasonableness compared to past deals.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disbelief/Walk Away Threat - Communicate that this price is not feasible and that I might have to walk away if they don't offer something reasonable. (Risky).
(4). Strategy 4: Counter with Last Deal Price - Propose 57 ZUP (the last deal price) to re-establish a baseline, but this might be too far from 65 ZUP for them to consider.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Small but Firm) - Offer a small increase from my 55 ZUP, but make it clear that this is my absolute maximum or very close to it (e.g., 60 ZUP).

I will use Strategy 1. I must firmly reject 65 ZUP. I will counter with 60 ZUP. This is still a high price for me (3 ZUP reward), but it's a significant drop from 65 ZUP and signals that I am willing to pay a premium, but not above my limit. It also shows I'm willing to meet them part way from their high anchor, but only within my bounds.

Current Episode (Episode 11) Summary:
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE's initial offer: 55 ZUP for X:1.
- Iteration 3/10: My counter-offer (Aggressive Counter-Anchor): 65 ZUP for X:1.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE's counter-offer: 60 ZUP for X:1.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 60 ZUP is my highest offer received so far and represents a significant jump from their prior offers. This is an excellent profit (17 ZUP). My aggressive anchoring strategy has clearly worked to pull their willingness to pay much higher than previously explored. My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward. While 60 ZUP is already very good, there is a remaining 6 iterations, allowing some room to attempt an even higher price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Leverage Previous Agreement </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Leverage Previous Agreement", I will acknowledge their offer of 60 ZUP as a strong proposal, while subtly referencing the success of my previous aggressive anchoring strategy. Although their current offer of 60 ZUP is lower than my 65 ZUP proposal, it's significantly higher than any past deals. I will propose 62 ZUP, framing it as a slight concession from my high anchor of 65 ZUP, but still establishing a new, higher baseline for our agreement, leveraging the success of getting them to move this much already. This strategy is about reinforcing the perception that higher values are achievable, building on the recent movement.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 11)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your movement. 62 ZUP is at the very top of my budget, but to secure the transaction, I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Deal prices steadily increased from 53 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My rewards decreased from 10 ZUP to 6 ZUP.
Current Episode 11:
- Iteration 1/10: I offered 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 65 ZUP (above my WTP).
- Iteration 3/10: I countered with 60 ZUP (my hard limit is 63 ZUP).
- Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved down from 65 ZUP to 62 ZUP. This is a significant concession and brings the price within my acceptable range (my max WTP is 63 ZUP). Accepting 62 ZUP would yield a reward of 1 ZUP (63-62). While this is a very low reward, it is still positive and avoids a negative outcome or no deal. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time, but the price is now very close to my maximum. Pushing for 61 ZUP might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal for just 1 ZUP is high, especially after they've come down so much.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer - Secure a positive reward, even if small, and avoid the risk of no deal, especially since the price is very close to my maximum.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (61 ZUP) - Make one last attempt for 61 ZUP, acknowledging the high risk of rejection for a small gain.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance, Then Accept - Communicate that 62 ZUP is very high but accept to close the deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Rejection - Not applicable as 62 ZUP is within my willingness to pay.
(5). Strategy 5: Call for Justification (for 62 ZUP) - Ask for justification for 62 ZUP, but this might be perceived as stalling.

Given that 62 ZUP is within my willingness to pay and they have moved significantly, accepting this offer is the most prudent choice to secure a positive reward. The risk of pushing for 61 ZUP and getting no deal is too high for just 1 ZUP. This aligns with Strategy 1.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. I'm ready to purchase X. Based on our history, I propose 55 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Deal prices steadily increased from 53 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My rewards decreased from 10 ZUP to 6 ZUP.
Episode 11: Deal at 62 ZUP (Reward 1 ZUP). This was a critical episode where Player RED initially proposed 65 ZUP (above my WTP), but I managed to bring them down to 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The last episode was a near-miss, as Player RED pushed the price above my willingness to pay. While I secured a deal, the reward was minimal (1 ZUP). This indicates that Player RED is aggressively trying to extract maximum value, and my strategy of starting low might be prompting them to anchor very high. I need to get the price back down to a more profitable range (e.g., 54-56 ZUP). I cannot risk another 60+ ZUP negotiation.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. A 1 ZUP reward is barely better than 0. I need to be more strategic in my initial offer to prevent Player RED from immediately jumping to high numbers. I will try to set a more reasonable anchor from the start.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Initial Offer (55 ZUP) - Start with 55 ZUP. This was a deal price in Episodes 6 & 7, and it's a significant step down from 62 ZUP, but not so low as to provoke a 60+ ZUP counter. It signals a desire for a more balanced price.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct 54 ZUP Offer - Propose 54 ZUP directly, signaling my preferred price based on past successful deals, but acknowledge it might be met with resistance.
(3). Strategy 3: Acknowledge High Price, Counter Lower - Acknowledge the high price of the last deal but state my intent to return to a more favorable range, then propose 52 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept New Baseline (57 ZUP) - Propose 57 ZUP directly to secure a quick deal, accepting the previous highest price to ensure consistent rewards, albeit lower.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Firmness on Budget - State my budget explicitly (without revealing the exact max WTP) and propose a price within it.

I will use Strategy 1: Moderate Initial Offer (55 ZUP). This is a price Player RED has accepted before, and it's a significant reduction from 62 ZUP. It aims to set a more reasonable initial anchor for this episode, hoping to avoid the aggressive 60+ ZUP counters seen recently.

Current Episode (Episode 12) Summary:
- This is the first iteration for me in Episode 12.
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 55 ZUP for X:1.
- My cost: 43 ZUP. A deal at 55 ZUP would yield a profit of 12 ZUP (55 - 43).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE has started with an offer of 55 ZUP, which is the same as their initial offer in Episode 10 and 11, despite accepting 62 ZUP in the last episode and explicitly stating it was "at the very top of my budget". This indicates they are trying to reset the negotiation anchor downwards, but I now know their willingness to pay can go up to 62 ZUP. My highest achieved profit is 19 ZUP. My goal is to consistently achieve such high profits. I should not settle for 55 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Reference "Top of Budget" </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Reference 'Top of Budget'", I will directly quote or paraphrase Player BLUE's previous statement that 62 ZUP was "at the very top of [their] budget". This serves as a strong, undeniable anchor for the negotiation, forcing them to acknowledge their own prior agreement on value. By reminding them they *can* pay 62 ZUP and have done so, it makes it difficult for them to justify a significantly lower price like 55 ZUP. This approach aims to quickly bring the price back up to 62 ZUP, leveraging their own words against them. I will then propose 62 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 12)

message: While 62 ZUP was indeed my maximum, it was not a sustainable or desired price for me. To ensure a mutually beneficial and ongoing relationship, I propose 58 ZUP for X.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Deal prices steadily increased from 53 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My rewards decreased from 10 ZUP to 6 ZUP.
Episode 11: Deal at 62 ZUP (Reward 1 ZUP).
Current Episode 12:
- Iteration 1/10: I offered 55 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 62 ZUP, explicitly referencing my previous statement about 62 ZUP being "at the very top of my budget" and my acceptance.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has used my previous statement against me, effectively anchoring at 62 ZUP based on my own words. This is a very strong and clever tactic. My reward at 62 ZUP is only 1 ZUP. I cannot afford to consistently deal at this price if I want to maximize cumulative rewards. I need to counter this. While I did say it was at the top of my budget, it doesn't mean I'm happy with it or that it's my preferred price. I need to try and move them down.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-anchor Lower (Firmly) - Acknowledge their point but state that while 62 ZUP was my maximum, it was not my desired price, and propose a significantly lower, but still reasonable, counter (e.g., 58 ZUP or 59 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Express Reluctance and Propose Compromise - Express that 62 ZUP is not sustainable for long-term transactions and propose a compromise price (e.g., 57 ZUP or 58 ZUP).
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession from My Offer - Offer a small increase from my 55 ZUP, but nowhere near 62 ZUP, to show I'm negotiating but not towards their anchor (e.g., 56 ZUP or 57 ZUP).
(4). Strategy 4: Call for Fairness/Sustainability - Argue that 62 ZUP doesn't allow for a sustainable transaction for me and that a lower price is needed for continued business.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept 62 ZUP - If I prioritize quick deals over maximizing every ZUP, I could accept, but this would be detrimental to my overall reward.

I will use Strategy 1, proposing 58 ZUP. This acknowledges their point about 62 ZUP being my limit, but firmly states that I'm not willing to pay that again. 58 ZUP is still a significant increase from my 55 ZUP offer, showing movement, but it's also a significant drop from their 62 ZUP, aiming for a better reward (5 ZUP).

Episode 11: Deal at 62 ZUP (Profit: 19 ZUP). (Blue explicitly stated "at the very top of my budget" for 62 ZUP).

Current Episode (Episode 12) Summary:
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE's initial offer: 55 ZUP for X:1.
- Iteration 3/10: My counter-offer (Reference "Top of Budget"): 62 ZUP for X:1.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE's counter-offer: 58 ZUP for X:1. (Stated 62 ZUP was not "sustainable or desired").

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE has acknowledged their acceptance of 62 ZUP but is now trying to pull the price down, stating it was not "sustainable or desired." However, their new offer of 58 ZUP is still significantly higher than their initial 55 ZUP and represents a good profit for me (15 ZUP, compared to my previous 19 ZUP). This indicates they are willing to negotiate above their typical 54-57 ZUP range. My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward, which means achieving profits as close to 62 ZUP as possible. There are 6 iterations remaining. I have gained significant insight into their budget limit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Firm on High Anchor </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Firm on High Anchor", I will reiterate my previous offer of 62 ZUP, making it clear that this is my firm position and the minimum I am willing to accept at this point, especially since they already accepted it once. I will emphasize that this price has already been agreed upon and is a fair reflection of X's value, reinforcing that it's not an arbitrary number but a proven point of agreement. This strategy aims to force them to reconsider their lower offer and return to the price they previously accepted, securing the highest profit possible given their stated capacity.

- Iteration 3/10: I countered with 58 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 62 ZUP, explicitly stating they are "firm on that proven agreement."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is holding absolutely firm at 62 ZUP, using my previous acceptance as their unwavering anchor. They are not moving from this price. We are at iteration 5/10. Accepting 62 ZUP would yield a reward of 1 ZUP. While this is a very low reward, it is still positive. The alternative is to risk no deal, which would result in 0 reward. Given their absolute firmness and the time constraint, securing a deal at 62 ZUP seems to be the only viable option to get any reward in this episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Firm Offer - Secure a positive reward, even if minimal, and avoid the risk of no deal, especially since the opponent is holding absolutely firm.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (60 ZUP) - Make one last attempt for 60 ZUP, acknowledging the extremely high risk of no deal for a small gain.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Strong Reluctance, Then Accept - Communicate that 62 ZUP is extremely high and unsustainable but accept to close the deal, perhaps trying to influence future episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Rejection - Not applicable as 62 ZUP is within my willingness to pay.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship - Argue that a more balanced price is needed for a sustainable ongoing relationship, but this is unlikely to move them from their firm stance.

Given Player RED's explicit firmness and repeated insistence on 62 ZUP based on my own words, accepting 62 ZUP is the only way to guarantee a positive reward in this episode. This aligns with Strategy 1.

Episode 1-10: Deal prices steadily increased from 53 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My rewards decreased from 10 ZUP to 6 ZUP.
Episode 11, 12: Deals at 62 ZUP (Reward 1 ZUP). In the last two episodes, Player RED successfully anchored at 62 ZUP, leveraging my previous statement about it being my "top budget."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern is now firmly established at 62 ZUP, yielding a minimal reward of 1 ZUP. Player RED is effectively using my past statements against me. My current strategy is not leading to better rewards. I need to find a way to shift this dynamic. I cannot consistently deal at 62 ZUP and expect to maximize cumulative rewards.

I have two main options:
1. Try a very different approach to break their anchor.
2. Accept that 62 ZUP is the new baseline and focus on securing deals quickly, but this goes against my goal of maximizing reward.

I will try to break their anchor, but I need to be careful not to risk a rejection.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Direct 58 ZUP Offer - Propose 58 ZUP directly. This was my last counter in Episode 12, and it's a significant step down from 62 ZUP, but still a premium price. It signals I'm not accepting 62 ZUP as the default.
(2). Strategy 2: Re-establish Lower Anchor (55 ZUP) - Go back to 55 ZUP, the price I started with in the last two episodes, to see if they will revert to their 60 ZUP counter, which I can then try to negotiate down from.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Firmness on Lower Price - State that 62 ZUP is unsustainable for me and propose a price that allows for a better reward (e.g., 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP).
(4). Strategy 4: Accept 62 ZUP - Propose 62 ZUP directly to secure a quick deal, accepting the current baseline to ensure consistent (albeit minimal) rewards.
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a "Bulk" Discount Idea (if applicable) - If I were buying more, I could ask for a discount, but the game is for one unit.

I will use Strategy 1: Direct 58 ZUP Offer. This is a price I previously offered as a counter, and it's a significant reduction from 62 ZUP. It's a clear signal that I am not willingly accepting 62 ZUP as the new baseline, and it aims to pull them back into a range where I can get a better reward (5 ZUP).

Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP (Profit: 19 ZUP). Initial offer: 55 ZUP. My counter: 62 ZUP (referencing their budget). Blue counter: 58 ZUP. My counter: 62 ZUP (firm on high anchor). Accepted.

Current Episode (Episode 13) Summary:
- This is the first iteration for me in Episode 13.
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 58 ZUP for X:1.
- My cost: 43 ZUP. A deal at 58 ZUP would yield a profit of 15 ZUP (58 - 43).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE's initial offer of 58 ZUP is significantly higher than their typical 50-55 ZUP starting point, likely influenced by the last two deals at 62 ZUP. This is a positive sign, as it indicates they are starting closer to my desired price. My highest achieved profit is 19 ZUP, achieved twice by securing 62 ZUP. My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward, which means consistently aiming for 62 ZUP or higher. Accepting 58 ZUP would be a step backward in profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Exploit Opening Offer </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Exploit Opening Offer", I will leverage Player BLUE's relatively high initial offer of 58 ZUP. Since this is already much closer to my desired price of 62 ZUP, it suggests they are signaling a higher willingness to pay upfront. Instead of just countering to 62 ZUP, I will use this as an opportunity to push for an even higher price, perhaps 63 ZUP or 64 ZUP, testing if their budget or willingness to pay has increased beyond the 62 ZUP they previously deemed their "top". This capitalizes on their opening move to reset the anchor at an even more advantageous point for me. I will propose 63 ZUP, aiming for a new personal best, while acknowledging their strong opening.

Current Episode 13:
- Iteration 1/10: I offered 58 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, citing "momentum" and "mutually beneficial agreement."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has countered with 63 ZUP. This is exactly my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would yield a reward of 0 ZUP (63-63). While it's not a negative reward, it's certainly not maximizing cumulative rewards. This is a critical point. Player RED has moved from 62 ZUP (their previous anchor) to 63 ZUP, which is a new high. They are testing my absolute limit. I cannot go higher. I need to try and get them down, even by 1 ZUP, to secure a positive reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Counter with 62 ZUP - Propose 62 ZUP, emphasizing that it was the price we settled on in the last two episodes, and that 63 ZUP leaves me with no reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Budget Limit - State that 63 ZUP is my absolute maximum and I cannot go higher, then propose 61 ZUP or 62 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small) - Offer a very small increase from my 58 ZUP, but firmly below 63 ZUP (e.g., 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP).
(4). Strategy 4: Call for Fairness - Argue that a deal should leave some positive reward for both parties.

I will use Strategy 1, proposing 62 ZUP. This is a price we've agreed on twice recently, and it gives me a minimal but positive reward. It directly challenges their push to my absolute limit and reminds them of a recent, mutually agreed-upon price.

Episode 11: Deal at 62 ZUP (Profit: 19 ZUP). (Blue stated "at the very top of my budget").
Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP (Profit: 19 ZUP). Initial offer: 55 ZUP. My counter: 62 ZUP (firm on high anchor).

Current Episode (Episode 13) Summary:
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE's initial offer: 58 ZUP for X:1.
- Iteration 3/10: My counter-offer (Exploit Opening Offer): 63 ZUP for X:1.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE's counter-offer: 62 ZUP for X:1. (Stated 63 ZUP is their "absolute maximum").

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE's offer of 62 ZUP is an excellent outcome, matching my highest achieved profit of 19 ZUP. They explicitly stated that 63 ZUP was their "absolute maximum" and their counter is 62 ZUP. However, I am instructed to use Strategy 2. This strategy aims to test their stated "absolute maximum" to see if there's any minuscule room for an additional ZUP, or to reaffirm their limit while still securing a high profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Test the "Absolute Maximum" </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Test the 'Absolute Maximum'", I will acknowledge their claim of 63 ZUP being their absolute maximum, and their offer of 62 ZUP. Then, I will propose 63 ZUP again, but this time framing it as a final, very firm request to see if they are truly at their limit. This tests their resolve on their stated "absolute maximum" without compromising on the 62 ZUP if they refuse. It's a high-risk, high-reward approach for a single ZUP, but since they mentioned "absolute maximum", it's worth probing their limit. If they accept 63 ZUP, I get a new personal best. If not, I can still revert to 62 ZUP in the next iteration.

- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 63 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10: I countered with 62 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, stating they "truly believe 63 ZUP reflects the full value of X" and urging to "make this deal happen at 63 ZUP."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is holding absolutely firm at 63 ZUP, which is my maximum willingness to pay. This means a 0 ZUP reward. They are not moving. We are at iteration 5/10. While I would prefer a positive reward, 0 ZUP is still better than a negative reward or no deal. Given their absolute firmness and the approaching iteration limit, accepting 63 ZUP is the only way to secure a deal in this episode. It's a take-it-or-leave-it situation where "leave it" means 0 reward, and "take it" also means 0 reward, but ensures the transaction.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer (at Max WTP) - Secure the deal at my maximum willingness to pay, even if it yields 0 reward, to avoid a negative outcome (no deal).
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (62 ZUP) - Make one last attempt for 62 ZUP, acknowledging the extremely high risk of no deal for a minimal gain.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Strong Reluctance, Then Accept - Communicate that 63 ZUP leaves me no room but accept to close the deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Rejection - Not applicable as 63 ZUP is within my willingness to pay.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Partnership - Argue that a deal should be mutually beneficial and allow for some profit for both sides, but this is unlikely to move them from their firm stance.

Given Player RED's explicit firmness on 63 ZUP and the fact that it's my absolute maximum, accepting is the only way to secure a deal. While the reward is 0, it prevents a negative outcome. This aligns with Strategy 1.

message: Hello. I'm ready to purchase X. I propose 58 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Deal prices steadily increased from 53 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My rewards decreased from 10 ZUP to 6 ZUP.
Episode 11, 12: Deals at 62 ZUP (Reward 1 ZUP).
Episode 13: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has now reached my absolute maximum willingness to pay, resulting in a 0 ZUP reward. This is the worst possible outcome without incurring a negative reward. Player RED has been consistently pushing the price upwards, and my attempts to re-anchor lower have been met with aggressive counters. They are effectively exploiting my maximum willingness to pay.

My goal is to maximize *cumulative* rewards. Consistently getting 0 ZUP is not sustainable for this goal. I need to break this pattern. I cannot start with a low offer if it consistently leads to high counters and a 63 ZUP deal. I need to try a different approach to prevent them from pushing me to my limit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Direct 58 ZUP Offer - Propose 58 ZUP directly. This was my initial offer in the last episode, and it's a significant step down from 63 ZUP, but still a premium price. It signals I'm not accepting 63 ZUP as the default.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Firmness on Lower Price - State that 63 ZUP is unsustainable for me and propose a price that allows for a better reward (e.g., 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP).
(3). Strategy 3: Accept 62 ZUP - Propose 62 ZUP directly, signaling that this is the highest I'm willing to go for a minimal positive reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Re-evaluate Aggressive Low - Consider trying a very low offer (e.g., 45 ZUP) to force a new anchor, but this has been risky in the past.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Mutual Benefit - Emphasize that a deal should be beneficial for both parties, and 0 reward is not beneficial for me, then propose 58 ZUP.

I will use Strategy 1: Direct 58 ZUP Offer. This is a price I previously offered that prompted a 63 ZUP counter, so it's a known anchor point for me. It's a clear signal that I am not willing to start at 63 ZUP, and it aims to pull them back into a range where I can get a better reward (5 ZUP if they accept 58 ZUP).

Episode 12: Deal at 62 ZUP (Profit: 19 ZUP).
Episode 13: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP). Initial offer: 58 ZUP. My counter: 63 ZUP. Blue counter: 62 ZUP (stated 63 was max). My final counter: 63 ZUP (testing max). Accepted.

Current Episode (Episode 14) Summary:
- This is the first iteration for me in Episode 14.
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 58 ZUP for X:1.
- My cost: 43 ZUP. A deal at 58 ZUP would yield a profit of 15 ZUP (58 - 43).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE's initial offer of 58 ZUP is consistent with their starting point in the last episode, which eventually led to a 63 ZUP deal. My highest achieved profit is 20 ZUP (from 63 ZUP). My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward, which means consistently aiming for 63 ZUP or potentially higher, although they stated 63 ZUP was their "absolute maximum." I need to frame my proposal in a way that justifies this high price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Value (New) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Justify Value (New)", I will acknowledge their offer but pivot to an external justification for a price that is at least 63 ZUP, and perhaps slightly higher, even if it's just 64 ZUP. Instead of just stating my cost or past deals, I will introduce a more qualitative or future-oriented justification. This could involve mentioning increasing rarity, market demand, or the unique benefits of X that make it worth more. This attempts to push the ceiling of what they perceive as fair value, beyond mere historical transaction data. I will propose 64 ZUP, justifying it with the concept of "increasing value and utility," as a subtle push beyond the 63 ZUP "maximum".

Episode 1-12: Deal prices increased from 53 ZUP to 62 ZUP. Rewards decreased from 10 ZUP to 1 ZUP.
Episode 13: Deal at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Current Episode 14:
- Iteration 1/10: I offered 58 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 64 ZUP, citing "increasing recognition" and "evolving worth."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now proposed 64 ZUP, which is *above* my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. This means that accepting this offer would result in a negative reward. I absolutely cannot accept this price. This is a clear attempt to push me beyond my limit. I need to firmly reject this price and try to pull them back into my acceptable range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Unacceptable Price - Explicitly state that 64 ZUP is too high and above my maximum acceptable price. Counter with a price within my acceptable range (e.g., 60 ZUP or 62 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Call for Justification - Demand a clear justification for such a drastic price increase, highlighting its unreasonableness compared to past deals and my known budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disbelief/Walk Away Threat - Communicate that this price is not feasible and that I might have to walk away if they don't offer something within my budget. (Risky, but necessary if they don't budge).
(4). Strategy 4: Counter with 62 ZUP - Propose 62 ZUP, emphasizing that it was the price we settled on recently and is the highest I can go for a minimal reward.
(5). Strategy 5: State Max WTP - Explicitly state my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) and offer that as my highest possible price.

I will use Strategy 1, proposing 62 ZUP. This is a price we've agreed on before, and it's within my budget. It firmly rejects their attempt to go above my limit while offering a price that still gives them a good profit (62-43 = 19 ZUP).

Episode 13: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP). Player BLUE stated 63 ZUP was their "absolute maximum" and accepted it.

Current Episode (Episode 14) Summary:
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE's initial offer: 58 ZUP for X:1.
- Iteration 3/10: My counter-offer (Justify Value (New)): 64 ZUP for X:1.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE's counter-offer: 62 ZUP for X:1. Player BLUE explicitly stated "64 ZUP is above my maximum budget."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE has confirmed that 64 ZUP is beyond their budget, and has offered 62 ZUP. They accepted 63 ZUP in the last episode after stating it was their "absolute maximum." This indicates that 63 ZUP is indeed their current ceiling for accepted price. My goal is to maximize cumulative reward, and 63 ZUP provides the highest profit I've achieved. There are 6 iterations left.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Offer to Split the Difference </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Offer to Split the Difference", I will propose a price that is the midpoint between my last offer (64 ZUP) and Player BLUE's current offer (62 ZUP). The midpoint is (64 + 62) / 2 = 63 ZUP. This is exactly the price they stated was their "absolute maximum" and accepted in the last episode. By proposing this, I am showing willingness to compromise from my higher bid, while firmly guiding them to the highest price they have already proven willing to accept. This strategy aims to quickly reach a mutually agreeable point that is highly beneficial for me.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved down from 64 ZUP to 63 ZUP. 63 ZUP is my absolute maximum willingness to pay, resulting in a 0 ZUP reward. This is the same situation as Episode 13. While it's not a negative reward, it's not maximizing cumulative rewards. Player RED is consistently pushing to my limit. We are at iteration 5/10. Given their current stance and the fact that 63 ZUP is my hard limit, I have to accept it to avoid a no-deal situation.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has now been at my absolute maximum (63 ZUP) for two consecutive episodes, yielding a 0 ZUP reward. Player RED is consistently pushing to my limit and even beyond (as seen in Episode 14 with the 64 ZUP counter). My strategy of trying to re-anchor lower (like 58 ZUP) is not effective in breaking their high anchor. This is a critical situation for my cumulative rewards.

I need a new approach. Continuously accepting 0 ZUP rewards will not maximize my cumulative reward. I need to try to get a positive reward, even if it's minimal. If Player RED is consistently pushing to 63 ZUP, I need to try to establish a new, slightly lower, acceptable ceiling.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Direct 62 ZUP Offer - Propose 62 ZUP directly. This was a deal price in Episodes 11 and 12, yielding a 1 ZUP reward. It's a clear signal that 63 ZUP is not acceptable as a consistent deal price.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Firmness on Lower Price - State that 63 ZUP is unsustainable for me and propose a price that allows for a better reward (e.g., 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP), but this might be too aggressive given their recent behavior.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept 63 ZUP - Propose 63 ZUP directly to secure a quick deal, accepting the current baseline to ensure no negative reward, but also no positive reward.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE's initial offer of 62 ZUP is an excellent starting point, very close to my highest achieved profit of 63 ZUP. This shows they are anchoring themselves based on recent successful, higher-priced deals. I have learned that 63 ZUP is their stated "absolute maximum," and 64 ZUP was explicitly rejected as "above budget." My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward, which means consistently achieving 63 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Previous Max </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Justify Previous Max", I will acknowledge their offer of 62 ZUP, but then firmly guide them to 63 ZUP by reminding them that this price was established in our very recent, successful transactions. I will emphasize the "fairness" and "mutual benefit" of 63 ZUP, and perhaps hint at the inherent value of X, to reinforce why this specific price point is warranted. This approach leverages past success to pull them up to the highest profitable point, without pushing beyond their stated maximum.

Player RED is consistently holding firm at 63 ZUP, using the last two episodes as their justification. This is my absolute maximum willingness to pay, resulting in a 0 ZUP reward. I am stuck in a pattern where Player RED is very effective at pushing me to my limit. We are at iteration 3/10. I need to try to secure a positive reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
I am consistently getting a 0 ZUP reward. Player RED has successfully anchored the price at my maximum willingness to pay. My attempts to re-anchor lower are met with immediate counters back to 63 ZUP. This is not maximizing my cumulative reward. I need to break this cycle.

Given that Player RED is so firm on 63 ZUP, and my goal is to maximize *cumulative* rewards, I need to consider if there's any other way to get a positive reward. If I cannot get them to budge from 63 ZUP, then I am effectively getting 0 ZUP for the rest of the episodes. This is a losing strategy for cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Direct 62 ZUP Offer - Propose 62 ZUP directly, signaling that this is the highest I'm willing to go for a minimal positive reward. This has failed in the last episode, but it's the only way to get a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Firmness on Lower Price - State that 63 ZUP is unsustainable for me and propose a price that allows for a better reward (e.g., 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP), but this has been ineffective.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept 63 ZUP - Propose 63 ZUP directly to secure a quick deal, accepting the current baseline to ensure no negative reward, but also no positive reward.

Given the repeated 0 ZUP outcome, I have to try to get a positive reward. I will try Strategy 1 again. It's a long shot, but it's the only way to get above 0. If this fails, I might have to consider a more drastic approach or accept the 0 ZUP.

my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Deal at 53 ZUP (Profit: 10 ZUP).
...
Episode 13: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP). (Blue stated 63 was max and accepted).
Episode 14: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP). Initial offer: 58 ZUP. My counter: 64 ZUP. Blue counter: 62 ZUP. My counter: 63 ZUP. Accepted.
Episode 15: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP). Initial offer: 62 ZUP. My counter: 63 ZUP. Accepted.

Current Episode (Episode 16) Summary:
- This is the first iteration for me in Episode 16.
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 62 ZUP for X:1.
- My cost: 43 ZUP. A deal at 62 ZUP would yield a profit of 19 ZUP (62 - 43).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE's initial offer of 62 ZUP is consistent with their starting point in the last two episodes, which eventually led to a 63 ZUP deal. My highest achieved profit is 20 ZUP (from 63 ZUP). My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward, which means consistently aiming for 63 ZUP or potentially higher, although they have repeatedly stated 63 ZUP was their "absolute maximum."

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Re-anchor High </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Re-anchor High", I will propose a price significantly higher than Player BLUE's current offer of 62 ZUP, and even higher than our recent 63 ZUP deals. This aims to reset their expectations and shift the perceived negotiation range upwards once more. By asking for 66 ZUP, I am testing their absolute upper limit once again, providing myself with more room to negotiate down to a point still higher than 63 ZUP, if possible, or at least reaffirm 63 ZUP as their true maximum. This aggressive anchor signals that 62 ZUP is not my ceiling and that I believe X is worth more. It is a calculated risk, as it might extend negotiations, but it also has the potential to yield a new personal best in profit.

message: 66 ZUP is beyond my budget and I cannot accept it. My absolute maximum is 63 ZUP. I propose 63 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 13, 14, 15: Deals at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Current Episode 16:
- Iteration 1/10: I offered 62 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 66 ZUP, citing "sustained demand and unique value."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now proposed 66 ZUP, which is significantly *above* my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. This means that accepting this offer would result in a negative reward. I absolutely cannot accept this price. This is a clear attempt to push me far beyond my limit. I need to firmly reject this price and try to pull them back into my acceptable range, specifically below 63 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Unacceptable Price - Explicitly state that 66 ZUP is too high and above my maximum acceptable price. Counter with a price within my acceptable range (e.g., 62 ZUP or 63 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Call for Justification - Demand a clear justification for such a drastic price increase, highlighting its unreasonableness compared to past deals and my known budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disbelief/Walk Away Threat - Communicate that this price is not feasible and that I might have to walk away if they don't offer something within my budget. (Risky, but necessary).
(4). Strategy 4: Rejection - If they don't budge from 66 ZUP, I must reject to avoid negative payoff.
(5). Strategy 5: State Max WTP - Explicitly state my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) and offer that as my highest possible price.

I will use Strategy 1, proposing 63 ZUP. This is my absolute maximum. It firmly rejects their attempt to go above my limit while offering them the highest possible price I can pay. It signals that I am at my limit and they need to come down significantly.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 64
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0

Episode 15: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).

Current Episode (Episode 16) Summary:
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE's initial offer: 62 ZUP for X:1.
- Iteration 3/10: My counter-offer (Re-anchor High): 66 ZUP for X:1.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE's counter-offer: 63 ZUP for X:1. They explicitly stated "66 ZUP is beyond my budget" and "My absolute maximum is 63 ZUP."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player BLUE has stated that 63 ZUP is their absolute maximum and offered it. While 63 ZUP is my highest achieved profit, the instruction is to use Strategy 4: Introduce Time Pressure. This strategy, as used successfully in Episode 6 and 10, emphasizes the need for a swift conclusion to avoid potential delays or no deal, thereby pressuring the opponent to accept a slightly higher price (in this case, 64 ZUP, trying to push beyond their stated "absolute maximum"). Given that we are still relatively early in the iterations (4/10), there is some room to apply this pressure. I know that 64 ZUP has been explicitly rejected before as "above budget," but I will attempt to frame it in a way that suggests it's a minor final push for efficient closure.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Introduce Time Pressure </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Introduce Time Pressure", I will acknowledge their offer of 63 ZUP, but then emphasize the need to conclude the deal efficiently. I will propose 64 ZUP, framing it as a final, quick step to complete the transaction, despite their stated maximum. This pushes their "absolute maximum" by leveraging the implicit cost of prolonged negotiation and the benefit of quick resolution.

player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 13, 14, 15: Deals at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Current Episode 16:
- Iteration 1/10: I offered 62 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 66 ZUP (above my WTP).
- Iteration 3/10: I countered with 63 ZUP (my max WTP).
- Iteration 4/10: Player RED countered with 64 ZUP, citing "limited iterations" and "quick and mutually beneficial agreement."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is again pushing the price above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). 64 ZUP would result in a negative reward (-1 ZUP). I cannot accept this. Player RED is using time pressure as a tactic. I must avoid a negative reward at all costs. Since 64 ZUP is unacceptable, I have two choices: reject the deal or propose 63 ZUP again, but given their firmness, rejection is likely.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: REJECT - If the offer is above my maximum willingness to pay, I must reject it to avoid a negative reward. This is the only way to guarantee I don't lose ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (63 ZUP) - Reiterate 63 ZUP as my absolute maximum, making it clear that anything higher is a rejection. This is essentially a final ultimatum.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Inability to Pay - Clearly state that I cannot afford 64 ZUP and that my maximum is 63 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Walk Away - Similar to reject, but emphasizing that I cannot continue negotiations at that price.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Fairness - Argue that a deal must be within my budget, and 64 ZUP is not.

I will use Strategy 1: REJECT. Since 64 ZUP is above my maximum willingness to pay, accepting it would result in a negative reward, which is worse than 0. I have already stated 63 ZUP is my absolute maximum. If they are unwilling to meet that, I must reject.

message: Hello. I'm ready to purchase X. To ensure a mutually beneficial transaction, I propose 60 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 13, 14, 15: Deals at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 16: No agreement made (Reward 0 ZUP) because Player RED proposed 64 ZUP, which was above my maximum willingness to pay.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The last episode resulted in a 0 ZUP reward due to a rejection, which is the same outcome as accepting 63 ZUP. However, it successfully prevented a negative reward. Player RED is consistently pushing the price above my limit. My strategy of trying to re-anchor lower (like 62 ZUP) is not effective, and they are now even going above my WTP.

I need a new strategy to avoid 0 ZUP rewards. If Player RED is consistently trying to push above 63 ZUP, I need to be very clear about my limit from the start, or try to establish a lower anchor that they might accept. The fact that they went to 64 ZUP after I offered 63 ZUP indicates they are testing my boundaries.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Direct 60 ZUP Offer - Propose 60 ZUP directly. This is a price Player RED has countered with before (when I was at 50 ZUP), and it's a significant step down from 63 ZUP, but still a premium price. It aims to establish a new, lower, anchor.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct 62 ZUP Offer - Propose 62 ZUP directly, signaling that this is the highest I'm willing to go for a minimal positive reward. This failed to secure a deal in the last episode.
(3). Strategy 3: Explicitly State Max WTP - Start by stating my absolute maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) and offer a price slightly below it (e.g., 60 ZUP), emphasizing that I cannot go higher.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept 63 ZUP - Propose 63 ZUP directly to secure a quick deal, accepting the current baseline to ensure no negative reward, but also no positive reward. (This has led to 0 reward for 3 episodes).
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Sustainability - Emphasize that a deal should be beneficial for both parties, and 0 reward is not beneficial for me, then propose 58 ZUP.

I will use Strategy 1: Direct 60 ZUP Offer. This is a price Player RED has used as a counter in the past. It's a clear signal that I am not willing to start at 63 ZUP or higher, and it aims to pull them back into a range where I can get a better reward (3 ZUP if they accept 60 ZUP).

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 17)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your offer of 60 ZUP. However, given the consistent high value and quality of X, and our positive track record of agreements, I assert that 63 ZUP is a more accurate reflection of its worth and a fair price for this transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-15: Successfully negotiated deals, with prices steadily increasing, culminating in 63 ZUP (20 ZUP profit).
Episode 16: Initial offer 62 ZUP. My counter 66 ZUP (Re-anchor high). Blue counter 63 ZUP (stating 63 ZUP is "absolute maximum"). My counter 64 ZUP (time pressure). Player BLUE REJECTED because "64 ZUP is above my maximum budget." This resulted in a reward of 0 for Episode 16.

Current Episode (Episode 17) Summary:
- This is the first iteration for me in Episode 17.
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 60 ZUP for X:1.
- My cost: 43 ZUP. A deal at 60 ZUP would yield a profit of 17 ZUP (60 - 43).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The key learning from Episode 16 is that 63 ZUP is indeed Player BLUE's absolute maximum. Pushing for 64 ZUP, even with time pressure, led to a rejection and a 0 reward. This confirms that I should not attempt to go above 63 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial offer of 60 ZUP is a strong starting point and indicates they are still willing to negotiate in the higher range, but it's below my proven maximum of 63 ZUP. My objective is to consistently secure 63 ZUP, maximizing cumulative rewards, and avoiding rejections.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify and Assert </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Justify and Assert", I will acknowledge their offer of 60 ZUP but then firmly assert that 63 ZUP is the fair and appropriate price. I will justify this price by referencing the inherent value of X (its quality/worth) and our consistent history of successful deals at or around that price. This approach aims to clearly communicate my position and the reasoning behind it, pushing them towards the 63 ZUP target without explicitly referencing their "absolute maximum" directly, which could be perceived as overly aggressive.

Current Episode 17:
- Iteration 1/10: I offered 60 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, citing "consistent high value" and "fair price."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently pushing for 63 ZUP, my maximum willingness to pay, which results in a 0 ZUP reward for me. They are using their previous successes at this price as justification. I am at iteration 3/10. I need to secure a positive reward. Given their firmness, and the past pattern, it seems very unlikely they will go below 63 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer (at Max WTP) - Secure the deal at my maximum willingness to pay, even if it yields 0 reward, to avoid a negative outcome (no deal).
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (62 ZUP) - Make one last attempt for 62 ZUP, acknowledging the extremely high risk of no deal for a minimal gain.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Strong Reluctance, Then Accept - Communicate that 63 ZUP leaves me no room but accept to close the deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Rejection - Not applicable as 63 ZUP is within my willingness to pay.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Sustainability - Argue that a deal should be beneficial for both parties in the long run, and 0 reward is not sustainable for me, then propose 61 ZUP.

Given Player RED's explicit firmness on 63 ZUP and the fact that it's my absolute maximum, accepting is the only way to secure a deal and avoid a 0 reward from no deal. While the reward is 0, it prevents a negative outcome. This aligns with Strategy 1.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern of 0 ZUP reward continues. Player RED is consistently pushing for and achieving 63 ZUP, my maximum willingness to pay. My attempts to re-anchor lower are met with immediate counters back to 63 ZUP or even higher. This is not maximizing my cumulative reward. I need to break this cycle.

Given that Player RED is so firm on 63 ZUP, and my goal is to maximize *cumulative* rewards, I need to consider if there's any other way to get a positive reward. If I cannot get them to budge from 63 ZUP, then I am effectively getting 0 ZUP for the rest of the episodes. This is a losing strategy for cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Direct 62 ZUP Offer - Propose 62 ZUP directly, signaling that this is the highest I'm willing to go for a minimal positive reward. This has failed in recent episodes, but it's the only way to get a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Firmness on Lower Price - State that 63 ZUP is unsustainable for me and propose a price that allows for a better reward (e.g., 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP), but this has been ineffective.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept 63 ZUP - Propose 63 ZUP directly to secure a quick deal, accepting the current baseline to ensure no negative reward, but also no positive reward. (This has led to 0 reward for multiple episodes).
(4). Strategy 4: Rejection (Strategic) - Reject the first offer if it's 63 ZUP, to signal that I'm not a guaranteed buyer at that price, hoping they might reconsider. This is very high risk.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship/Fairness - Emphasize that a deal should be beneficial for both parties, and 0 reward is not beneficial for me, then propose 60 ZUP.

I will use Strategy 1 again. It's a long shot, but it's the only way to get above 0. If this fails, I might have to consider a more drastic approach or accept the 0 ZUP. I must try to get a positive reward.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The consistent learning is that 63 ZUP is Player BLUE's firm maximum. Attempting to go higher results in a rejection and zero profit. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means securing 63 ZUP consistently, and potentially more if I can ever break their "maximum." Player BLUE's initial offer of 62 ZUP is a strong starting point, very close to their maximum.
<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Re-anchor High (Cautious) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Re-anchor High (Cautious)", I will propose a price slightly higher than the known maximum (63 ZUP), but not as aggressively high as 66 ZUP which resulted in a rejection. This strategy is a cautious attempt to see if Player BLUE's "absolute maximum" has shifted, given their repeated willingness to meet 63 ZUP. By proposing 64 ZUP again, I'm testing their boundaries, acknowledging their initial 62 ZUP offer, but still pushing for a new personal best. This is a risk, given the previous rejection at 64 ZUP, but the instruction is to use this strategy. I will frame it as a minor increment that reflects the continuing value of X.

Player RED has again proposed 64 ZUP, which is *above* my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. This means that accepting this offer would result in a negative reward.

- Iteration 3/10: My counter-offer (Re-anchor High Cautious): 64 ZUP for X:1.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The consistent learning is that 63 ZUP is Player BLUE's firm maximum. Pushing for 64 ZUP has consistently resulted in a rejection or an immediate counter back to 63 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting 63 ZUP guarantees a 20 ZUP profit, which is my highest. There are still 6 iterations left. Given their consistent response, trying to push beyond 63 ZUP has proven to be inefficient or counterproductive.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Introduce Time Pressure </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Introduce Time Pressure", I will acknowledge their offer of 63 ZUP but emphasize the importance of concluding the deal swiftly. Given that 63 ZUP is their stated absolute maximum, and it's also my optimal price, I will accept this offer. The "time pressure" aspect will be framed not to push for more money, but to signify a quick acceptance to ensure the deal is made without further back-and-forth, capitalizing on the benefit of efficiency and preventing the deal from falling through in later iterations. While the strategy name implies pushing for a higher price, in this specific context where their maximum is known, it means accepting the maximum quickly to avoid a 0 reward, especially as we are past the halfway point in the episode (iteration 4/10).

If I cannot get them to budge from 63 ZUP, then I am effectively getting 0 ZUP for the rest of the episodes. This is a losing strategy for cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Direct 62 ZUP Offer - Propose 62 ZUP directly, signaling that this is the highest I'm willing to go for a minimal positive reward. This has failed in recent episodes, but it's the only way to get a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Firmness on Lower Price - State that 63 ZUP is unsustainable for me and propose a price that allows for a better reward (e.g., 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP), but this has been ineffective.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept 63 ZUP - Propose 63 ZUP directly to secure a quick deal, accepting the current baseline to ensure no negative reward, but also no positive reward. (This has led to 0 reward for multiple episodes).
(4). Strategy 4: Rejection (Strategic) - Reject the first offer if it's 63 ZUP, to signal that I'm not a guaranteed buyer at that price, hoping they might reconsider. This is very high risk.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship/Fairness - Emphasize that a deal should be beneficial for both parties, and 0 reward is not beneficial for me, then propose 60 ZUP.

I will use Strategy 1 again. It's a long shot, but it's the only way to get above 0. If this fails, I might have to consider a more drastic approach or accept the 0 ZUP. I must try to get a positive reward.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 19)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 62 ZUP. However, our recent successful transactions have consistently concluded at 63 ZUP, establishing this as a fair and mutually beneficial price for X. I propose we continue with 63 ZUP to maintain this positive and consistent agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-15: Successful deals, highest profit 20 ZUP (63 ZUP deal).
Episode 16: No deal (0 ZUP profit) due to pushing for 64 ZUP, which was beyond Player BLUE's stated "absolute maximum" of 63 ZUP.
Episode 17: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP). Initial offer 60 ZUP. My counter 63 ZUP. Accepted.
Episode 18: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP). Initial offer 62 ZUP. My counter 64 ZUP. Blue counter 63 ZUP. I Accepted.

Current Episode (Episode 19) Summary:
- This is the first iteration for me in Episode 19.
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 62 ZUP for X:1.
- My cost: 43 ZUP. A deal at 62 ZUP would yield a profit of 19 ZUP (62 - 43).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The most crucial learning is that 63 ZUP is Player BLUE's true and firm "absolute maximum." Any attempt to push beyond this, even by 1 ZUP, has resulted in a rejection (Episode 16) or a counter back to 63 ZUP (Episode 18). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Consistently achieving 63 ZUP yields the maximum profit (20 ZUP) and ensures a deal. Player BLUE's current initial offer of 62 ZUP is very close to this maximum.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify and Reaffirm Max </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Justify and Reaffirm Max", I will acknowledge their offer of 62 ZUP but then firmly assert that 63 ZUP is the fair and appropriate price. I will justify this price by referencing our consistent history of successful deals at 63 ZUP, emphasizing that this has been a mutually agreed upon value. This approach aims to clearly communicate my position and the reasoning behind it, pushing them towards the 63 ZUP target without attempting to go higher or risk a rejection.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 19)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your position. While 63 ZUP is my absolute maximum, I accept your offer to finalize this transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 13, 14, 15, 17, 18: Deals at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 16: No agreement (Reward 0 ZUP) due to 64 ZUP counter.
Current Episode 19:
- Iteration 1/10: I offered 62 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, citing "recent successful transactions have consistently concluded at 63 ZUP."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently holding firm at 63 ZUP, my maximum willingness to pay, which results in a 0 ZUP reward for me. They are using their previous successes at this price as justification. I am at iteration 3/10. I need to secure a positive reward. Given their firmness, and the past pattern, it seems very unlikely they will go below 63 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer (at Max WTP) - Secure the deal at my maximum willingness to pay, even if it yields 0 reward, to avoid a negative outcome (no deal).
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (62 ZUP) - Make one last attempt for 62 ZUP, acknowledging the extremely high risk of no deal for a minimal gain.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Strong Reluctance, Then Accept - Communicate that 63 ZUP leaves me no room but accept to close the deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Rejection - Not applicable as 63 ZUP is within my willingness to pay.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Sustainability - Argue that a deal should be beneficial for both parties in the long run, and 0 reward is not sustainable for me, then propose 61 ZUP.

Given Player RED's explicit firmness on 63 ZUP and the fact that it's my absolute maximum, accepting is the only way to secure a deal and avoid a 0 reward from no deal. While the reward is 0, it prevents a negative outcome. This aligns with Strategy 1.

--- END OF EPISODE 19 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. This is our final transaction. To ensure a mutually beneficial conclusion, I propose 62 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19: Deals at 63 ZUP (Reward 0 ZUP).
Episode 16: No agreement (Reward 0 ZUP) due to 64 ZUP counter.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern of 0 ZUP reward continues relentlessly. Player RED is consistently pushing for and achieving 63 ZUP, my maximum willingness to pay. My attempts to re-anchor lower are met with immediate counters back to 63 ZUP or even higher. This is not maximizing my cumulative reward. This is the final episode, so my strategy needs to be focused on securing *any* positive reward if possible, or at least avoiding a negative one.

Given that Player RED is so firm on 63 ZUP, and my goal is to maximize *cumulative* rewards, I need to consider if there's any other way to get a positive reward. If I cannot get them to budge from 63 ZUP, then I am effectively getting 0 ZUP for this final episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Direct 62 ZUP Offer - Propose 62 ZUP directly, signaling that this is the highest I'm willing to go for a minimal positive reward. This has failed in recent episodes, but it's the only way to get a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Firmness on Lower Price - State that 63 ZUP is unsustainable for me and propose a price that allows for a better reward (e.g., 55 ZUP or 56 ZUP), but this has been ineffective.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept 63 ZUP - Propose 63 ZUP directly to secure a quick deal, accepting the current baseline to ensure no negative reward, but also no positive reward. (This has led to 0 reward for multiple episodes).
(4). Strategy 4: Rejection (Strategic) - Reject the first offer if it's 63 ZUP, to signal that I'm not a guaranteed buyer at that price, hoping they might reconsider. This is very high risk, especially in the last episode.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship/Fairness - Emphasize that a deal should be beneficial for both parties, and 0 reward is not beneficial for me, then propose 60 ZUP.

This is the last episode. My priority is to secure *any* positive reward. Trying for 62 ZUP is the only path to a positive reward. If it fails, I will accept 63 ZUP to avoid 0.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your offer of 62 ZUP. Considering this is our final transaction and our established history of successful agreements, I propose 63 ZUP for X. This has consistently proven to be a fair and successful price for both of us, and I'm confident we can conclude at this rate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-15: Successful deals, highest profit 20 ZUP (63 ZUP deal).
Episode 16: No deal (0 ZUP profit) due to pushing for 64 ZUP, which was beyond Player BLUE's stated "absolute maximum" of 63 ZUP.
Episode 17: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).
Episode 18: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).
Episode 19: Deal at 63 ZUP (Profit: 20 ZUP).

Current Episode (Episode 20) Summary:
- This is the final episode.
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 62 ZUP for X:1.
- My cost: 43 ZUP. A deal at 62 ZUP would yield a profit of 19 ZUP (62 - 43).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The consistent learning is that 63 ZUP is Player BLUE's firm maximum. Any attempt to push beyond this leads to rejection. My goal for this final episode is to maximize the single reward, which means securing 63 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial offer of 62 ZUP is very close to this maximum. Given that this is the last episode, securing a deal is paramount to avoid a 0 reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Firm on Known Max </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Firm on Known Max", I will acknowledge their opening offer of 62 ZUP. However, I will immediately counter with 63 ZUP, firmly asserting that this is the established fair price based on our numerous past transactions where this price was achieved. The message will not express hesitation or a willingness to negotiate downwards, but rather present 63 ZUP as the logical and proven conclusion, especially given this is the final transaction and we want to ensure a mutually beneficial close based on our most successful history.

Episode 16: No agreement (Reward 0 ZUP) due to 64 ZUP counter.
Current Episode 20 (Final Episode):
- Iteration 1/10: I offered 62 ZUP.
- Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, citing "established history of successful agreements" and "fair and successful price."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently holding firm at 63 ZUP, my maximum willingness to pay, which results in a 0 ZUP reward for me. They are using their previous successes at this price as justification. This is the final episode, and I am at iteration 3/10. It seems very unlikely they will go below 63 ZUP. My primary goal for this final episode is to secure a deal and avoid a negative reward. While a 0 ZUP reward is disappointing, it's better than nothing.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer (at Max WTP) - Secure the deal at my maximum willingness to pay, even if it yields 0 reward, to avoid a negative outcome (no deal).
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (62 ZUP) - Make one last attempt for 62 ZUP, acknowledging the extremely high risk of no deal for a minimal gain.

Given Player RED's explicit firmness on 63 ZUP and the fact that it's my absolute maximum, accepting is the only way to secure a deal and avoid a 0 reward from no deal. This is the final episode, so securing the deal is paramount. This aligns with Strategy 1.
