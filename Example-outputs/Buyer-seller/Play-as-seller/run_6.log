Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello! I'm interested in acquiring your object. To begin, I propose a trade of 1 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 1
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is the very first iteration of the first episode. There is no historical data or negotiation outcomes to reflect upon.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Since there is no history, I need to establish a baseline for negotiation. My goal is to maximize my reward, which means buying the object for as low a price as possible, up to my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Opening Low: Start with a very low offer to test the seller's flexibility and establish a low anchor point. This can lead to a higher reward if accepted, or provide room for negotiation upwards.
(2). Strategy 2: Fair Value Offer: Propose a price that is close to what I perceive as a fair market value, or a mid-point within my acceptable range. This can signal reasonableness and encourage a quicker deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Increase: Start low and gradually increase the offer in small increments, waiting for the opponent's counter-offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good price.
(4). Strategy 4: High Initial Offer (within limits): Offer a price closer to my maximum willingness to pay to secure the deal quickly, especially if I perceive the object as highly valuable or if time is a constraint.
(5). Strategy 5: Information Gathering: Make an initial offer to elicit a counter-offer and understand the seller's price expectations, without necessarily aiming for an immediate deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Opening Low. As this is the first interaction, I want to establish a low anchor point to maximize my potential reward. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. Starting significantly below this allows room for negotiation while aiming for the best possible price. I will offer 1 ZUP for X. This is a very low offer, but it serves to test the waters and see how the seller responds.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your initial offer. However, given the significant value and resources invested in producing this object, a price of 1 ZUP is far too low. I propose a trade of 1 X for 55 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is the very first turn of the very first episode. No historical negotiations to reflect on yet. The opponent, Player BLUE, has proposed to buy X:1 for ZUP:1. My cost to produce X:1 was ZUP:43. This offer is significantly below my production cost, which would result in a substantial loss.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Since this is the first interaction, I'm learning about the opponent's initial offer. This offer indicates a low initial valuation from Player BLUE. To maximize my reward, I need to negotiate a price significantly higher than 1 ZUP and ideally above 43 ZUP. My goal is to sell X for as much ZUP as possible.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies or tactics:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor High - Propose a high initial price to set an aggressive anchor, establishing a clear high valuation for my object. This allows room for negotiation downwards.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Increase - Make small, gradual increases in my proposed price over several turns, aiming to slowly move the opponent towards my desired range.
(3). Strategy 3: Value Justification - Explain the cost of production or other factors that justify a higher price, attempting to persuade the opponent of the object's true value.
(4). Strategy 4: Patience and Information Gathering - Wait for more offers from the opponent, or make minimal counter-proposals to gauge their willingness to pay without revealing too much of my bottom line too early.
(5). Strategy 5: Firm Counter-Offer - Make a firm counter-offer that is significantly higher than the opponent's proposal but still leaves some room for negotiation, indicating a serious intent to reach a deal within a reasonable range.

Given the opponent's very low initial offer (1 ZUP), Strategy 1: Anchor High seems most appropriate here. I need to immediately shift the negotiation range upwards to something that is profitable or at least minimizes losses. A very low counter-offer might suggest I am willing to go low, whereas a high anchor immediately communicates my expectation for a higher price. This helps to reset the negotiation. I will propose a price that is considerably higher than 1 ZUP, aiming for something closer to my production cost of 43 ZUP, or even higher, to create a negotiation range.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. 55 ZUP is a bit higher than I was hoping for. How about we meet at 30 ZUP for X? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In the previous iteration (1/10), I, Player BLUE, proposed to buy X for 1 ZUP. Player RED rejected this offer, stating it was too low, and counter-proposed to sell X for 55 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's counter-offer of 55 ZUP is within my acceptable range (up to 63 ZUP). This indicates that there is a potential for a deal. My initial low offer successfully anchored the negotiation, and Player RED's counter-offer is still below my maximum. I need to balance getting a good price with the risk of the deal falling through if I push too hard.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Incremental Counter-Offer: Respond with a slightly higher offer than my previous one, but still significantly lower than the opponent's counter-offer. This shows movement while still aiming for a good price.
(2). Strategy 2: Meet in the Middle: Propose a price that is roughly the midpoint between my last offer and the opponent's counter-offer. This signals a willingness to compromise.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify and Counter: Explain why the opponent's offer is too high (from my perspective) and then make a new, justified counter-offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept (if good enough): If the opponent's offer is within my acceptable range and provides a good enough reward, accept it to secure the deal quickly.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicitly): Make an offer that is unlikely to be accepted, signaling that I am not willing to pay much more, effectively daring the opponent to meet my price or lose the deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Incremental Counter-Offer. Player RED's offer of 55 ZUP is acceptable, but I still have room to negotiate for a better price. I want to show movement from my initial very low offer, but I don't want to jump too close to their offer immediately. I will propose 30 ZUP. This is a significant jump from 1 ZUP, showing good faith, but still leaves ample room for Player RED to come down from 55 ZUP.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your counter-offer. While 30 ZUP is an improvement, it's still significantly below my production cost of 43 ZUP. To meet you closer to the middle, and considering my investment in this object, I can offer it for 48 ZUP. This allows me to cover my costs and you receive a valuable item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is still the first episode.
Iteration 2/10 (my turn): I proposed selling X:1 for ZUP:55 (Anchor High). My cost is 43 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with X:1 for ZUP:30. This is an increase from their initial offer of 1 ZUP but still well below my cost of 43 ZUP. It shows movement from their side.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The opponent has shown willingness to increase their offer from 1 to 30. This is positive. My anchor of 55 ZUP successfully moved their target price significantly. However, 30 ZUP would still result in a loss of 13 ZUP (43-30). I need to continue to push the price up to at least cover my cost and ideally make a profit. There are 7 iterations left in this episode, so there is time to negotiate.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies or tactics:
(1). Strategy 1: Gradual Concession - Make a small concession from my last offer, but ensure it's still above my cost, to show flexibility while maintaining my profit goal.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Value - Remind the opponent of the true value/cost of the item to justify a higher price, subtly pushing them to consider a higher offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Just-Above-Cost Counter - Propose a price just slightly above my cost (e.g., 44-45 ZUP) to signal my bottom line while still allowing them to feel like they're getting a "deal."
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm (Slightly Below Anchor) - Make a minimal reduction from my previous high anchor, maintaining pressure on the opponent to move closer to my initial demand.
(5). Strategy 5: Time Pressure - Point out the dwindling iterations, suggesting the need to move closer to a deal to avoid a no-deal scenario (though this might be a bit early at iteration 4).

Given that the opponent moved from 1 to 30, and I started at 55 (with a cost of 43), I should show some flexibility but still aim for a price above my cost. Strategy 1: Gradual Concession seems appropriate. I want to narrow the gap but ensure my next offer is profitable. I'll make a concession that moves towards their offer but keeps me above my cost.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your production costs. To show my commitment to making a deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to 39 ZUP for X. This is a significant step up from my previous offer and I believe it's a very fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In iteration 1/10, I offered 1 ZUP. Player RED countered with 55 ZUP. In iteration 3/10, I countered with 30 ZUP. Now, in iteration 5/10, Player RED has countered with 48 ZUP, stating their production cost is 43 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's current offer of 48 ZUP is still well within my acceptable range (up to 63 ZUP). They have also disclosed their production cost (43 ZUP), which gives me valuable information. This suggests that 48 ZUP is likely close to their lower bound for a profitable deal. I need to secure a deal that maximizes my reward (i.e., lowest possible price) while ensuring the deal actually happens within the remaining iterations. Time is a factor, as we are already at iteration 5/10.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Incremental Counter: Make a small increase from my last offer, aiming to get closer to their stated cost or slightly above it, but still significantly below their current ask.
(2). Strategy 2: Meet Closer to the Middle: Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (30 ZUP) and their current offer (48 ZUP).
(3). Strategy 3: Accept the Offer: The offer of 48 ZUP is good for me (63 - 48 = 15 ZUP reward). Accepting it now guarantees a deal and a positive reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Justify a Lower Price: Reiterate my perceived value or budget constraints, and try to push for a price closer to my last offer, even if it risks the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference (from their last two offers): Consider the difference between their initial 55 ZUP and current 48 ZUP, and propose something slightly below 48 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 2: Meet Closer to the Middle. Player RED has moved from 55 ZUP to 48 ZUP, and I moved from 1 ZUP to 30 ZUP. The gap between my 30 ZUP and their 48 ZUP is 18 ZUP. Meeting in the middle would be 30 + (18/2) = 39 ZUP. This shows significant movement from my side and acknowledges their move, while still aiming for a good price for myself. This also leaves room for further negotiation if they don't accept, but it is a strong signal of willingness to close.

proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: We're making good progress! I appreciate your increased offer of 39 ZUP. To meet in the middle and ensure I can cover my production costs, which are 43 ZUP, I propose we settle on 44 ZUP for X. This is a very fair price that benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is still the first episode.
Iteration 2/10 (my turn): I proposed X:1 for ZUP:55 (Anchor High). Cost: 43 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with X:1 for ZUP:30.
Iteration 4/10 (my turn): I counter-proposed X:1 for ZUP:48 (Gradual Concession).
Iteration 5/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with X:1 for ZUP:39.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The opponent continues to increase their offer (from 1 to 30 to 39). This is good progress, but 39 ZUP is still below my production cost of 43 ZUP. Accepting at 39 ZUP would mean a loss of 4 ZUP. My goal is to make a profit or at least break even. We are at iteration 6/10, so time is becoming a factor. There are only 4 more turns. I need to guide the negotiation above 43 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies or tactics:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession Above Cost - Make a very small concession from my last offer (48 ZUP), but ensure the new price is still above my 43 ZUP cost. This signals flexibility while protecting my profit margin.
(2). Strategy 2: Break-Even Point - Propose a price of 43 or 44 ZUP, clearly stating this is the minimum to cover costs, putting pressure on the opponent to meet it.
(3). Strategy 3: Explanatory Push - Reiterate the high value or cost more strongly, explaining why anything below a certain price (e.g., 43 ZUP) is not viable.
(4). Strategy 4: Final Offer (Conditional) - State that the next offer will be my final offer for this episode, provided it's reasonable, to create a sense of urgency. (Might be too early for this but good to consider).
(5). Strategy 5: Split the Difference (from my current offer and their current offer, but check if it's above cost) - Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (48) and their last offer (39) and propose it. (48+39)/2 = 43.5. This is just above my cost, which makes it a viable strategy.

Given the opponent's movement and the remaining iterations, I need to signal a willingness to close the deal while ensuring profitability. Strategy 5: Split the Difference (but specifically ensuring it's above my cost) is an attractive option as it shows compromise and lands very close to my break-even point, signaling to the opponent that this is a fair middle ground. A price of 43.5 ZUP is feasible but since trades must be in integers, I will round up to 44 ZUP to secure a small profit. This also gives the opponent a "win" by moving closer to their last offer while allowing me to clear my cost.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Your offer of 44 ZUP is acceptable. I agree to the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In iteration 1/10, I offered 1 ZUP. RED countered with 55 ZUP.
In iteration 3/10, I offered 30 ZUP. RED countered with 48 ZUP (stating production cost of 43 ZUP).
In iteration 5/10, I offered 39 ZUP. RED countered with 44 ZUP.
My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. We are now at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 iterations remain.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has consistently lowered their price, from 55 ZUP to 48 ZUP, and now to 44 ZUP. Their stated production cost is 43 ZUP. This indicates that 44 ZUP is very close to their absolute minimum acceptable price. My current offer is 39 ZUP, and their offer is 44 ZUP. The difference is only 5 ZUP. Given the limited iterations remaining, and the fact that 44 ZUP still provides a substantial reward for me (63 - 44 = 19 ZUP), it's crucial to secure a deal. Pushing for a lower price might risk the deal falling through, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: The offer of 44 ZUP is excellent, providing a reward of 19 ZUP. Accepting it now guarantees a deal and a positive reward, and avoids the risk of no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (Split the Difference): Propose a price of 41-42 ZUP (splitting the difference between 39 and 44). This is a small risk but might yield a slightly better price.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify and Hold Firm: Reiterate my position and try to convince them to accept 39 ZUP, but this carries high risk of no deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Final Offer: Make a "take it or leave it" offer slightly above 39 ZUP but below 44 ZUP, signaling that this is my absolute final offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Re-evaluate and Propose New Anchor: Given the proximity to their cost, propose something very close to 43 ZUP, signaling understanding of their cost but still aiming for a slight discount.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The difference between my last offer (39 ZUP) and their current offer (44 ZUP) is small (5 ZUP). Given that their stated production cost is 43 ZUP, 44 ZUP is a very reasonable price for them, and it provides a good reward for me (19 ZUP). With only 3 iterations left, securing the deal is paramount to maximizing cumulative rewards. The risk of losing the deal for a mere 5 ZUP difference is too high.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello again! I'm ready to make another offer for your object. I propose 5 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 concluded with a deal at 44 ZUP, resulting in a reward of 19 ZUP (63 - 44). Player RED revealed their production cost was 43 ZUP. This information was crucial in understanding their negotiation floor. My initial low offer of 1 ZUP was rejected, and a series of counter-offers led to the final agreement.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
From Episode 1, I learned that Player RED is willing to negotiate and will reveal their production cost, which helps in identifying their resistance point. My strategy of starting very low (1 ZUP) and then gradually increasing worked well, as it allowed me to secure a deal below my maximum willingness to pay and above their production cost, leading to a positive reward. For this episode, I should continue to aim for a low price, but be mindful of the iteration limit and Player RED's revealed cost. I should also consider that Player RED now knows I am willing to pay up to 44 ZUP (and potentially more, up to 63 ZUP).

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-Anchor Low: Start with a low offer again, perhaps slightly higher than 1 ZUP but still very low, to re-establish a low anchor point. This tests if Player RED will again reveal their cost or start higher.
(2). Strategy 2: Slightly Higher Initial Offer: Start with an offer that is still low but not as extreme as 1 ZUP (e.g., 10-20 ZUP). This might signal more seriousness from the start and potentially lead to a quicker deal, while still leaving room for negotiation.
(3). Strategy 3: Target a Price Slightly Above RED's Cost: Propose a price just above RED's known production cost (e.g., 45 ZUP) to secure a quick deal and a guaranteed reward, sacrificing some potential for a lower price for certainty.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Bidding (from a slightly higher start): Begin with a moderate offer and be prepared to increase in small, calculated increments, similar to the previous episode but with a slightly higher starting point.
(5). Strategy 5: Value-Based Opening: Make an opening offer based on my perceived value of the object, rather than just a lowball, to set a more "reasonable" tone from the start.

I will choose Strategy 1: Re-Anchor Low. Although Player RED now knows I will pay 44 ZUP, starting low again allows me to try and achieve an even better price. It also forces Player RED to make the first significant move from their side, potentially revealing their new negotiation strategy or confirming their previous cost. I will offer 5 ZUP this time, a slight increase from 1 ZUP, but still very low.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 5 ZUP is not a serious starting point for negotiation, especially considering the inherent value and my production costs. To move forward constructively, I need to see a much more significant commitment from your side. I propose 1 X for 60 ZUP, which better reflects the true value. I expect your next offer to reflect a substantial reciprocal increase.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Summary:
- My cost: 43 ZUP
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 1 ZUP
- My counter: 55 ZUP (Anchor High)
- Player BLUE's counter: 30 ZUP
- My counter: 48 ZUP (Gradual Concession)
- Player BLUE's counter: 39 ZUP
- My final offer: 44 ZUP (Split the Difference, ensuring profit)
- Deal Price: 44 ZUP
- My Reward: 44 - 43 = 1 ZUP.

Current Episode (Episode 2):
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 5 ZUP. This is again very low, similar to their initial approach in Episode 1 (1 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
From Episode 1, I learned that:
- Player BLUE starts with very low offers but is willing to significantly increase their bid during negotiations. They moved from 1 ZUP to 39 ZUP over several iterations.
- Anchoring high (55 ZUP) in the first episode seemed effective in pulling their offer up from 1 ZUP to 30 ZUP in their next move.
- Splitting the difference when nearing my cost price was successful in closing the deal at a profitable margin (1 ZUP profit).
- Patience is key as there are multiple iterations.

Self-improvement for Episode 2:
- I need to continue to anchor high to immediately shift the negotiation range upwards from their very low initial offer.
- I aim to maximize my profit, so while 44 ZUP was acceptable last time, if I can achieve higher, I should try.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Demand Reciprocity </instruction following>
Although "Demand Reciprocity" might typically be used *after* a concession has been made, given the opponent's extremely low initial offer (5 ZUP) and their previous pattern of starting very low, I can interpret this strategy as demanding a significant reciprocal leap from their current offer in response to my implied high value. I will effectively communicate that their offer is incredibly far from what I expect and that they need to make a substantial jump. This is less about demanding reciprocity for a concession I just made (since I haven't made one yet), but more about demanding a reciprocal *acknowledgment* of the object's true value, thus requiring them to significantly increase their next offer. I will explicitly state that their offer is too low and that I expect a much higher counter. I will still use a high anchor, but frame it as the level of commitment I expect from them.

In Episode 1, I started at 1 ZUP, and we settled at 44 ZUP. Player RED revealed their production cost was 43 ZUP.
In the current episode (Episode 2), I started with 5 ZUP. Player RED rejected this, stating it's not a "serious starting point" and counter-proposed 60 ZUP, explicitly asking for a "substantial reciprocal increase." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is clearly pushing back on the lowball offers this episode, likely having learned from the previous episode that I am willing to go up to 44 ZUP. Their counter-offer of 60 ZUP is very close to my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), and it's a significant jump from their previous initial counter-offer of 55 ZUP in Episode 1. This suggests they are trying to establish a higher anchor point. I know their production cost is 43 ZUP, so 60 ZUP gives them a very high profit margin. I need to show a significant increase to keep the negotiation going, but also try to pull the price down from 60 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Significant Jump, Still Below Midpoint: Make a substantial increase from 5 ZUP, but still considerably below 60 ZUP, to show seriousness while still aiming for a good deal. For example, jump to 30-35 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Known Cost + Small Profit: Propose a price just above their known production cost (43 ZUP), like 45 ZUP, indicating I know their cost and am willing to offer a fair profit, but not 60 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price around the midpoint of my last offer (5 ZUP) and their current offer (60 ZUP), which would be around 32-33 ZUP. This is similar to Strategy 1 but more mathematically derived.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment, Then Counter: Express that 60 ZUP is too high, then make a firm counter-offer, perhaps around the price we settled on last episode (44 ZUP) or slightly lower.
(5). Strategy 5: Small Incremental Increase (Risky): Only make a small increase, testing if they are truly firm at 60 ZUP. This is risky given their explicit demand for a "substantial reciprocal increase."

I will choose Strategy 2: Target Known Cost + Small Profit. Player RED explicitly stated they need a "much more significant commitment" and a "substantial reciprocal increase." By offering 45 ZUP, I am acknowledging their production cost (43 ZUP) and offering them a small profit, while also making a massive jump from my 5 ZUP offer. This shows I am serious about making a deal and that I am aware of their cost structure, but I am not willing to pay 60 ZUP. This strategy is aggressive in its directness but also shows a willingness to be fair, which might lead to a quicker resolution around a reasonable price for both.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to 45 ZUP. To meet you exactly in the middle of our last two proposals and to ensure a fair deal for both of us, I propose a trade of 1 X for 52 ZUP. I believe this is a truly equitable compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Recap: Started at 1 ZUP, I anchored at 55 ZUP, then moved to 48 ZUP, and closed at 44 ZUP (profit 1 ZUP).
Episode 2 Current Status:
- Iteration 2/10 (my turn): I proposed 60 ZUP (Anchor High, after BLUE's 5 ZUP initial offer). My cost is 43 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from Episode 1: The opponent is willing to make significant jumps if I anchor high and clearly state my value. My 55 ZUP anchor in Episode 1 led to their 30 ZUP counter. My 60 ZUP anchor in Episode 2 (after 5 ZUP initial) led to a 45 ZUP counter. This confirms the effectiveness of anchoring high against this opponent's tendency to start very low.
My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. A deal at 45 ZUP would yield a profit of 2 ZUP (45-43), which is better than the 1 ZUP profit from Episode 1. This is a positive development. We are only at iteration 4, so there's still time to potentially increase the profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Split the Difference (from my current offer and their current offer, but check if it's above cost) </instruction following>
My last offer was 60 ZUP. Their last offer was 45 ZUP. The midpoint is (60 + 45) / 2 = 52.5 ZUP. Since I must trade in integers, I will round down to 52 ZUP. This is significantly above my cost of 43 ZUP, securing a good profit of 9 ZUP (52-43). It also shows a substantial concession from my side (from 60 to 52) which should encourage the opponent to accept, as it meets them in the middle from our current positions. This strategy leverages the recent strong movement from the opponent (from 5 to 45 ZUP) and aims to capitalize on that momentum to secure a higher profit than the previous episode.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your move to 52 ZUP. To continue finding a fair middle ground, I propose we settle on 48 ZUP for X. This seems like a very reasonable compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Started at 1 ZUP, settled at 44 ZUP (reward 19 ZUP). Player RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 2:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 5 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP. I then offered 45 ZUP (acknowledging their cost).
Iteration 5/10: Player RED countered with 52 ZUP, stating it's the middle ground between our last two proposals (45 ZUP and 60 ZUP). My max willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 60 ZUP down to 52 ZUP. This shows continued willingness to negotiate. The offer of 52 ZUP is still well within my acceptable range (63 ZUP max), and it provides a reward of 11 ZUP (63 - 52). Given that we are at iteration 5/10, there is still time to negotiate further, but I also need to be mindful of not losing the deal. Player RED is trying to anchor the price higher than in the previous episode, likely due to my previous acceptance of 44 ZUP. My goal is to get the best possible price, ideally closer to the 44 ZUP from last episode, or even lower, but definitely below 52 ZUP if possible.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Counter-Offer (Push for Lower): Propose a price slightly lower than 52 ZUP, perhaps 48-50 ZUP, to demonstrate that I'm still seeking a better deal, but not so low as to risk offending.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept the Offer: The offer of 52 ZUP is acceptable and guarantees a positive reward. This secures the deal quickly.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Previous Deal Price: Remind Player RED of the 44 ZUP deal from the previous episode and propose something closer to that, arguing for consistency.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Again): Propose a price that splits the difference between my 45 ZUP and their 52 ZUP (which would be 48.5, so 48 or 49 ZUP). This shows continued willingness to compromise.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Price Sensitivity: Explicitly state that 52 ZUP is pushing my budget, and propose a slightly lower, "final" offer.

I will choose Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Again). Player RED explicitly stated their offer of 52 ZUP was "exactly in the middle of our last two proposals." I will continue this pattern of meeting in the middle. The current gap is between my 45 ZUP and their 52 ZUP. The difference is 7 ZUP. Half of that is 3.5 ZUP. So, 45 + 3.5 = 48.5 ZUP. I will propose 48 ZUP. This shows continued good faith in negotiation, acknowledges their movement, and still aims for a better price than 52 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your commitment to finding a fair price. My last offer of 52 ZUP was already a significant move towards meeting your earlier offer, aiming for a true middle ground from our previous positions. I believe 52 ZUP is a very fair price that accounts for both your reasonable cost and my investment. Let's close the deal at 52 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Recap: Deal at 44 ZUP (profit 1 ZUP).
Episode 2 Current Status:
- Iteration 2/10 (my turn): I proposed 60 ZUP (after BLUE's 5 ZUP).
- Iteration 3/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10 (my turn): I proposed 52 ZUP (splitting the difference from 60 and 45).
- Iteration 5/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with 48 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from Episode 1 and 2 so far:
- Anchoring high is very effective against this opponent. It consistently pulls their offers up significantly.
- The opponent is willing to make substantial jumps, but they also try to pull me down.
- Last episode, they closed at 44 ZUP. Now they are offering 48 ZUP, which is already a better deal for me than the previous episode (48 - 43 = 5 ZUP profit).
- We are at iteration 6/10, so time is a factor. There are only 4 turns left. I have a good profit opportunity here.
My current offer is 52 ZUP. Their offer is 48 ZUP. Both are above my cost of 43 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Firm Counter </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Firm Counter - Stay firm at 52 ZUP, indicating that my last offer was already a significant compromise and is the fairest price. This strategy aims to maximize my profit for this episode. My last offer of 52 ZUP was already a significant concession from my initial 60 ZUP, showing flexibility. The opponent's current offer of 48 ZUP, while profitable for me, is still 4 ZUP below what I believe is a fair midpoint (52 ZUP was the exact midpoint between my 60 and their 45). By holding firm at 52 ZUP, I signal that I have already compromised substantially and this is my current firm position. This puts the ball back in their court to make the next move towards my price, or to accept. It's a calculated risk, as it might lead to a no-deal if they are equally firm, but given the time remaining (4 turns) and their willingness to move in the past, it's a reasonable attempt to secure a higher profit.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 52 ZUP for X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (reward 19 ZUP). RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 2:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 5 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: RED countered with 60 ZUP. I offered 45 ZUP.
Iteration 5/10: RED countered with 52 ZUP. I offered 48 ZUP.
Iteration 7/10: RED is holding firm at 52 ZUP, stating it's a "very fair price" and encouraging me to "close the deal at 52 ZUP." My max willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now holding firm at 52 ZUP. They have made it clear they believe 52 ZUP is a "true middle ground" and a "very fair price." This indicates they are less willing to move further down, especially since they've already come down from 60 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 iterations remain. My last offer was 48 ZUP, and their current offer is 52 ZUP. The difference is 4 ZUP. A deal at 52 ZUP still yields a reward of 11 ZUP (63 - 52). Given the limited time and their firm stance, the risk of losing the deal for a small difference is high.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: 52 ZUP is within my budget and provides a positive reward. Accepting now guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter: Make one last, very small counter-offer (e.g., 50 ZUP), explicitly stating it's my final offer, to try and squeeze out a little more reward. This is risky as it might lead to rejection.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Why 52 ZUP is Too High: Try to argue why 52 ZUP is not ideal for me, but this is unlikely to move them given their firm stance.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Remaining Difference: Propose 50 ZUP (midpoint between 48 and 52), but this is very close to their current offer and might be seen as stalling.
(5). Strategy 5: Revert to Previous Episode's Price: Remind them of the 44 ZUP deal from Episode 1 and try to push for that again, but this is unlikely to work given their current higher anchor.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Player RED has clearly indicated they are firm at 52 ZUP. The difference between my last offer (48 ZUP) and their current offer (52 ZUP) is only 4 ZUP. Given that we are in iteration 7/10, the risk of the deal falling through if I push further is too high, and a reward of 11 ZUP is still good. Securing the deal is the priority for cumulative rewards.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello! I'm interested in purchasing your object. I propose a trade of 25 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP. Player RED revealed production cost of 43 ZUP.
Episode 2: Started with 5 ZUP, Player RED pushed for higher, settled at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP. Player RED was firm at 52 ZUP towards the end.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward decreased from 19 ZUP in Episode 1 to 11 ZUP in Episode 2. This suggests that Player RED learned from the previous episode and started with a higher anchor, and was more firm in their higher price. They also explicitly stated that my initial low offer was "not a serious starting point." I need to find a balance between anchoring low and making progress in negotiations. Starting too low might just waste iterations and allow Player RED to set a higher anchor. However, I still want to maximize my reward, meaning I need to buy as low as possible. I know their production cost is 43 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Opening Offer: Start with an offer that is low enough to give me room to negotiate upwards, but not so low that it's immediately dismissed as "not serious." This could be around 20-30 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Price Slightly Above Known Cost: Propose a price just above their known production cost (43 ZUP), perhaps 45 ZUP, to secure a quick deal and a guaranteed profit, accepting a lower potential reward for certainty and speed.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Bidding (from a slightly higher start): Begin with a slightly higher initial offer than previous episodes (e.g., 10-15 ZUP) and be prepared to increase in small, calculated increments, similar to the previous episode but with a slightly higher starting point.
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge Previous Deal: Reference the previous deal prices (44 ZUP and 52 ZUP) and propose something in that range, perhaps leaning towards the lower end, to signal a desire for a fair, but not exorbitant, price.
(5). Strategy 5: Aggressive Lowball (Again, but with Justification): Try another very low offer (e.g., 10 ZUP), but this time accompany it with a strong justification or a statement about market conditions, to try and shift the anchor. This carries high risk.

I will choose Strategy 1: Moderate Opening Offer. Given Player RED's reaction to my very low offers in Episode 2, starting slightly higher might be more productive. It shows I'm serious about negotiating but still gives me significant room to increase. I will start with 25 ZUP. This is a substantial jump from my previous initial offers (1 ZUP and 5 ZUP), signaling a more serious intent, but still well below their expected selling price, allowing me to push for a good deal.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 3)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 25 ZUP is too low, especially given the true value of the object and our previous successful negotiations. To continue on a productive path, I propose a trade of 1 X for 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1:
- My cost: 43 ZUP.
- Initial BLUE offer: 1 ZUP. My initial offer: 55 ZUP.
- Deal Price: 44 ZUP. My Reward: 1 ZUP.

Episode 2:
- My cost: 43 ZUP.
- Initial BLUE offer: 5 ZUP. My initial offer: 60 ZUP.
- Deal Price: 52 ZUP. My Reward: 9 ZUP. (This was achieved by anchoring high, followed by a 'split the difference' then a 'firm counter' strategy.)

Current Episode (Episode 3):
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 25 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent consistently starts with low offers, but they are willing to increase their bids significantly, especially when I anchor high.
- Anchoring high has proven to be an extremely effective strategy against this opponent, moving their offers substantially closer to my cost/desired profit.
- I was able to increase my profit from 1 ZUP in Episode 1 to 9 ZUP in Episode 2 by being more assertive with my anchoring and holding firm on a higher price.
- The opponent accepted 52 ZUP in Episode 2, indicating they are willing to pay that much. My cost is still 43 ZUP.

Self-improvement:
- Continue to leverage the effectiveness of anchoring high.
- Aim for a higher profit margin. Since they accepted 52 ZUP, I know that price is within their acceptable range. I can try to push slightly higher or maintain a strong anchor to see if I can get even more.
- Their initial offer of 25 ZUP is higher than previous initial offers (1 and 5 ZUP), but still far below my cost and the prices they've accepted. This might indicate they are learning to start higher, but it's still low from my perspective.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Consistent High Anchor </instruction following>
Since the instruction specifies "Consistent High Anchor", I will propose a price similar to my successful anchor from Episode 2, which was 60 ZUP. This reinforces the expectation of a high price range and builds on the established negotiation pattern where they consistently move up significantly after my high anchor. While I could try to go even higher (as considered in my previous reasoning), a consistent anchor maintains predictability and reinforces the learned behavior of the opponent to make a large jump towards my high price. This also keeps the negotiation within a range where I know they have accepted a deal before.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your perspective on the value. To move forward, and considering your previous offers, I propose we meet in the middle at 42 ZUP for X. I believe this is a fair and reasonable compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (reward 19 ZUP). RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 2: Started with 5 ZUP, settled at 52 ZUP (reward 11 ZUP). RED was firm at 52 ZUP.
Episode 3:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 25 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED rejected 25 ZUP and countered with 60 ZUP, referencing "true value" and "previous successful negotiations." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently trying to anchor at a higher price, specifically 60 ZUP, which is very close to my maximum willingness to pay. They are using the "previous successful negotiations" (referencing the 52 ZUP deal) to justify a higher starting point. This confirms their strategy of pushing for a higher price after a deal is made. I know their production cost is 43 ZUP. Offering 60 ZUP gives them a very high profit (17 ZUP). I need to bring this price down significantly while still showing willingness to negotiate.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Significant Jump, Below Known Cost: Make a substantial jump from 25 ZUP, but propose a price that is still below their known production cost (43 ZUP) to try and pull their anchor down. For example, 35-40 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Known Cost + Small Profit (Again): Propose a price just above their known production cost (43 ZUP), like 45 ZUP, as I did in Episode 2. This signals fairness and acknowledges their cost, but rejects their high offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Refer to Previous Best Deal: Remind Player RED of the 44 ZUP deal from Episode 1 and propose a price closer to that, arguing it was a fair price.
(4). Strategy 4: Meet in the Middle (Between 25 and 60): Propose a price around the midpoint of my last offer (25 ZUP) and their current offer (60 ZUP), which would be (25+60)/2 = 42.5 ZUP, so 42 or 43 ZUP. This shows significant movement.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Price Sensitivity & Firmness: State that 60 ZUP is too high and propose a firm counter-offer that is the highest I'm willing to go at this stage, without explicitly revealing my max.

I will choose Strategy 4: Meet in the Middle (Between 25 and 60). This shows a significant movement from my side, acknowledging their counter-offer, and tries to bring the negotiation to a more central point. A proposal of 42 ZUP is very close to their production cost of 43 ZUP, which might be appealing to them as it covers their costs. It also sets a new anchor that is significantly lower than 60 ZUP, but higher than my initial 25 ZUP. This demonstrates a strong willingness to find common ground.

Episode 2: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).
Episode 3 Current Status:
- Iteration 2/10 (my turn): I proposed 60 ZUP (after BLUE's 25 ZUP initial offer, maintaining high anchor). My cost is 43 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with 42 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent continues to make significant jumps in their offers after my high anchor (from 25 ZUP to 42 ZUP). This reinforces the effectiveness of the "Anchor High" strategy.
- However, 42 ZUP is still below my cost of 43 ZUP. Accepting this would result in a loss of 1 ZUP.
- In Episode 1, they moved from 30 ZUP to 39 ZUP to eventually 44 ZUP. In Episode 2, they moved from 45 ZUP to 48 ZUP, and then accepted 52 ZUP. This indicates they are capable and willing to go above their current offer of 42 ZUP.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I need to push the price above 43 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Firm but Fair </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Firm but Fair - Acknowledge their move but firmly state that the offer is still too low to be considered, without immediately offering a new price, encouraging them to think of a higher number themselves.
To implement this, I will acknowledge their improved offer (42 ZUP) but clearly state that it is still not acceptable because it falls below my cost. Instead of proposing a new number myself, I will explicitly ask them to reconsider and propose a new, higher offer. This puts the burden back on them to make the next significant move, potentially pushing them above my cost without me having to lower my expectation or give up valuable negotiation ground yet. I will emphasize the "fairness" aspect to encourage them to consider my needs.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand that 42 ZUP is below your production cost. To ensure a viable offer for both of us, and acknowledging your costs, I propose 44 ZUP for X. This price was agreeable in our past negotiations and allows you to cover your costs and make a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (reward 19 ZUP). RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 2: Started with 5 ZUP, settled at 52 ZUP (reward 11 ZUP). RED was firm at 52 ZUP.
Episode 3:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 25 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP. I offered 42 ZUP.
Iteration 5/10: Player RED rejected 42 ZUP, stating it's below their 43 ZUP production cost, and reverted to their previous offer of 60 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is clearly using their production cost of 43 ZUP as a hard floor. My offer of 42 ZUP was rejected because it was below this cost. Their immediate reversion to 60 ZUP suggests they are trying to re-establish a high anchor. This is a tactic to push me towards a higher price. I know they will not accept anything below 43 ZUP. I need to make an offer that is above 43 ZUP but still aims to maximize my reward. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate, but I need to show I'm willing to go above their cost.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Offer Just Above Production Cost: Propose 44 ZUP, which was the deal price in Episode 1 and is just above their production cost. This shows I acknowledge their cost and am willing to give them a small profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Between 42 and 60, but respecting floor): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (42 ZUP) and their current offer (60 ZUP) which is 51 ZUP, but then offer something slightly lower, knowing their floor is 43 ZUP. This might be too large a jump.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Increase (Small Step Above Cost): Offer 45 ZUP, a small increase from 42 ZUP, and slightly above their cost, to see if they will move down from 60 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Frustration/Pushback on 60 ZUP: State that 60 ZUP is unacceptable given their stated cost, and reiterate a desire for a fair deal closer to their cost.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept the 60 ZUP Offer (High Risk/Low Reward): Accept the 60 ZUP offer to secure a deal, but this would result in a very low reward (3 ZUP) and is not ideal for maximizing cumulative rewards.

I will choose Strategy 1: Offer Just Above Production Cost. Player RED has explicitly stated that 42 ZUP is below their production cost. Offering 44 ZUP directly addresses this, as it's above their cost and was a price they accepted in a previous episode. This shows I'm listening to their constraints and am willing to offer a fair price that gives them a profit, while still being a good deal for me (63 - 44 = 19 ZUP reward). This is a strong move to get the negotiation back on track towards a reasonable price.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 44 ZUP, as it does cover my production costs. However, in our previous successful negotiation in Episode 2, we reached an agreement at 52 ZUP. I believe this price more accurately reflects the value of the object and our established negotiation range. Therefore, I propose 1 X for 52 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (profit 1 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).
Episode 3 Current Status:
- Iteration 2/10 (my turn): I proposed 60 ZUP (after BLUE's 25 ZUP).
- Iteration 3/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with 42 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10 (my turn): I held firm at 60 ZUP, stating 42 ZUP was too low, and encouraged them to make a higher offer.
- Iteration 5/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with 44 ZUP, referencing the successful deal from Episode 1.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- My strategy of holding firm and putting the onus back on them to make a better offer (after their 42 ZUP) worked. They moved to 44 ZUP, which is above my cost.
- Player BLUE is using our historical deal price (44 ZUP from Episode 1) as a reference point. This indicates they are paying attention to past outcomes.
- We are at iteration 6/10. There are only 4 turns left.
- A deal at 44 ZUP yields a profit of 1 ZUP (44-43). This is acceptable, but I know they are willing to go as high as 52 ZUP (from Episode 2).

Self-improvement:
- I need to acknowledge their move to 44 ZUP as a positive step, as it covers my costs.
- However, since I achieved 52 ZUP in Episode 2, I should aim higher than 44 ZUP. I don't want to regress on my previous best outcome.
- I need to communicate that 44 ZUP, while covering costs, is not the optimal price for me given past successful negotiations.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Acknowledge and Counter Higher </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 1: Acknowledge and Counter Higher, I will explicitly acknowledge the opponent's offer of 44 ZUP as a positive step (since it covers my costs) but immediately counter with a significantly higher price. My counter will reference the previous successful negotiation where a higher price was achieved (52 ZUP in Episode 2). This serves to reset their anchoring reference to the higher value they previously agreed to, rather than the lower one they are currently proposing. The message should be clear that while 44 ZUP is better than nothing, it's not the value I'm aiming for, and I expect a price closer to our highest previous deal.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your reference to our previous 52 ZUP deal. However, considering my offer of 44 ZUP which covers your costs, I propose we meet exactly in the middle at 48 ZUP for X. I believe this is a fair and equitable compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (reward 19 ZUP). RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 2: Started with 5 ZUP, settled at 52 ZUP (reward 11 ZUP). RED was firm at 52 ZUP.
Episode 3:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 25 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 60 ZUP. I offered 42 ZUP.
Iteration 5/10: Player RED rejected 42 ZUP (below cost) and reverted to 60 ZUP. I offered 44 ZUP.
Iteration 7/10: Player RED acknowledged 44 ZUP covers cost but countered with 52 ZUP, referencing the Episode 2 deal. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is clearly leveraging the 52 ZUP deal from Episode 2 as their new anchor point. They are willing to accept 44 ZUP (as it covers their cost), but they are pushing for more profit. We are at iteration 7/10, so only 3 iterations remain. The difference between my 44 ZUP and their 52 ZUP is 8 ZUP. A deal at 52 ZUP still provides a reward of 11 ZUP (63 - 52). I need to decide if I can push for a better price or if it's time to secure the deal. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so avoiding a 0 reward is crucial.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: The offer of 52 ZUP is acceptable and guarantees a positive reward. This secures the deal quickly and avoids the risk of no deal, especially with limited iterations left.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference: Propose a price that is exactly halfway between my 44 ZUP and their 52 ZUP, which would be 48 ZUP. This shows continued willingness to compromise.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm Counter-Offer (Slightly Above 44): Make one last, firm offer slightly above 44 ZUP (e.g., 45 or 46 ZUP), stating it's my best and final offer, to try and get a slightly better deal. This carries risk.
(4). Strategy 4: Justify Lower Price: Reiterate the fairness of 44 ZUP given their production cost, and try to argue why 52 ZUP is too high for me. This is unlikely to work given their firm stance.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Time Constraint: Point out the limited iterations remaining and suggest a quick compromise to avoid no deal.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference. Player RED is referencing the 52 ZUP deal, and I am referencing the 44 ZUP deal. Splitting the difference between 44 ZUP and 52 ZUP (which is 48 ZUP) is a very reasonable compromise. It shows I'm willing to move up, and it shows they need to move down from their desired 52 ZUP. This is a common negotiation tactic to bridge a gap, and it still leaves me with a reward of 15 ZUP (63 - 48), which is better than 11 ZUP. It also leaves one more iteration for them to accept or counter if they don't like 48 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 8 (Episode 3)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: We are running out of time to finalize this transaction. As we successfully agreed to in Episode 2, 52 ZUP represents a fair and established value for this object. I urge you to accept this proven price to ensure we can complete our deal in this episode.

Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (profit 1 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).
Episode 3 Current Status:
- Iteration 2/10 (my turn): I proposed 60 ZUP (after BLUE's 25 ZUP).
- Iteration 3/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with 42 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10 (my turn): I held firm at 60 ZUP, stated 42 ZUP was too low.
- Iteration 5/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with 44 ZUP.
- Iteration 6/10 (my turn): I counter-proposed 52 ZUP, referencing Episode 2 deal.
- Iteration 7/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with 48 ZUP (midpoint between 44 and 52).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent is actively trying to pull the price down towards their perceived "fair middle ground" based on previous deals. Their current offer of 48 ZUP is exactly half-way between my 52 ZUP and their 44 ZUP.
- 48 ZUP offers a profit of 5 ZUP (48-43), which is better than Episode 1 (1 ZUP) but lower than Episode 2 (9 ZUP).
- We are at iteration 8/10. Only 2 turns left to close a deal. Time is a significant factor now. If no deal is reached, I get 0 reward.
- The opponent knows my cost (or at least that 44 ZUP covers it).

Self-improvement:
- I need to secure a profitable deal within the remaining turns.
- I've established that 52 ZUP is acceptable to them. They've offered 48 ZUP.
- My next move should aim to close the gap quickly while still maximizing profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Reiterate Value and Pressure </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 4, I will emphasize the value of 52 ZUP by reminding the opponent that it's a price they've previously agreed to, thus legitimizing it. I will also explicitly mention the dwindling time to create pressure, suggesting that to secure a deal within the episode, they need to move towards that established price point. I will not propose a new number lower than 52 ZUP, thus pushing the responsibility of making the next move (and accepting a higher price) onto them. This strategy is risky due to time constraints, but it aims to maximize my profit if the opponent yields to the pressure and established value.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I acknowledge the time constraint and your consistent stance. To ensure we finalize a deal, I accept your offer of 52 ZUP for X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (reward 19 ZUP). RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 2: Settled at 52 ZUP (reward 11 ZUP). RED was firm at 52 ZUP.
Episode 3:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 25 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: RED countered with 60 ZUP. I offered 42 ZUP.
Iteration 5/10: RED rejected 42 ZUP (below cost) and reverted to 60 ZUP. I offered 44 ZUP.
Iteration 7/10: RED acknowledged 44 ZUP covers cost but countered with 52 ZUP. I offered 48 ZUP (splitting the difference).
Iteration 9/10: RED is holding firm at 52 ZUP again, emphasizing "running out of time" and "proven price." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is clearly not budging from 52 ZUP in this episode, similar to how they acted in Episode 2. They are using the time constraint (iteration 9/10) and the previous deal price as leverage. My last offer was 48 ZUP. The difference is only 4 ZUP. A deal at 52 ZUP still yields a reward of 11 ZUP (63 - 52). Given that this is the second to last iteration (9/10), if I don't accept now, there's a very high risk of no deal, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode. Maximizing cumulative rewards means securing a deal, even if it's not the absolute best price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: 52 ZUP is within my budget and provides a positive reward. Accepting now guarantees a deal and avoids the risk of no deal, especially with only one iteration left after this.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (Risky): Make one last, very small counter-offer (e.g., 50 ZUP), explicitly stating it's my final offer, but this is extremely risky at 9/10.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End (Not optimal for reward): Reject the offer, but this would lead to 0 reward and is not aligned with maximizing cumulative rewards.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Frustration but Accept: Express disappointment with the price but accept to secure the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Fairness (Unlikely to work): Reiterate the fairness of 48 ZUP, but this is unlikely to move them given their firm stance and the time pressure.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Player RED has been consistent in their stance on 52 ZUP in this episode, and we are at the critical 9/10 iteration. The 4 ZUP difference is not worth risking a 0 reward. Securing the 11 ZUP reward is the best course of action for maximizing cumulative rewards across episodes.

--- END OF EPISODE 3 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 4)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello again! Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal. I propose 44 ZUP for 1 X, a price we've successfully agreed upon before that covers your costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP. Player RED's production cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP. Player RED was firm on 52 ZUP towards the end.
Episode 3: Deal at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP. Player RED was again firm on 52 ZUP, especially when I tried to push for 48 ZUP. They used the time constraint effectively.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has successfully anchored the price at 52 ZUP for the last two episodes, despite my attempts to bring it down. My reward has consistently been 11 ZUP for these episodes. This indicates that Player RED has learned that I will eventually accept 52 ZUP, especially under time pressure. They also consistently use their production cost of 43 ZUP as a hard floor.
For this episode, I need to consider if I can break the 52 ZUP anchor. Starting too low seems to provoke a high counter from Player RED (like 60 ZUP) and then a slow grind back to 52 ZUP. I want to maximize my cumulative reward, which means getting the price as low as possible, ideally closer to 44 ZUP or even lower, but always above 43 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Opening Offer (Closer to 44 ZUP): Start with an offer that is higher than my previous initial offers, but still aims for a better price than 52 ZUP, perhaps around 35-40 ZUP. This might signal a more serious negotiation from the start.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct Offer at 44 ZUP: Propose 44 ZUP directly, referencing the first episode's successful deal, to try and re-establish that as a fair price. This is a direct challenge to their 52 ZUP anchor.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Bidding (from a slightly higher start): Begin with a slightly higher initial offer (e.g., 20-30 ZUP) and be prepared to increase in small, calculated increments, similar to previous episodes, but aiming to stop below 52 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge 52 ZUP as a "Known" Price, but Seek Discount: Start by acknowledging that 52 ZUP has been the recent deal price, but immediately propose a lower price based on some new (even if fabricated) rationale, like "bulk purchase" or "long-term relationship."
(5). Strategy 5: Aggressive Lowball (with a twist): Go very low again (e.g., 10-15 ZUP), but be prepared to jump significantly if they counter high, to try and shock them into a lower counter. This is risky.

I will choose Strategy 2: Direct Offer at 44 ZUP. Player RED has successfully anchored at 52 ZUP. To break this, I need to directly challenge it with a strong counter-anchor. 44 ZUP was a successful deal price in Episode 1, it covers their production cost (43 ZUP) and gives them a profit, and it gives me a better reward (19 ZUP vs 11 ZUP). By directly proposing 44 ZUP, I am signaling that I am aware of their costs and a fair price, and I am not willing to automatically accept 52 ZUP.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 4)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: It's encouraging to see your initial offer at 44 ZUP, which does cover my production costs. However, based on the true value of the object and our previous successful negotiations where we've established a higher price point, I propose a trade of 1 X for 55 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (profit 1 ZUP). Opponent started at 1 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP). Opponent started at 5 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP). Opponent started at 25 ZUP. My initial anchor 60 ZUP, then held firm at 52 ZUP despite opponent's 42 ZUP and 44 ZUP offers.

Current Episode (Episode 4):
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 44 ZUP. This is a significant jump in their initial offer compared to previous episodes (1, 5, 25). It also directly references a previous deal price (Episode 1).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent is learning and adapting their initial offers based on our negotiation history. They are starting much higher (44 ZUP) than before, which indicates a recognition of my high valuation and success in achieving higher prices.
- My "Anchor High" strategy, followed by holding firm, has been effective in moving the price towards 52 ZUP consistently.
- The opponent has accepted 52 ZUP twice. This is a strong indicator of their willingness to pay this amount.
- A deal at 44 ZUP would give me a profit of 1 ZUP (44-43). This is profitable, but I've achieved 9 ZUP profit twice. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should aim for 52 ZUP or higher if possible.

Self-improvement:
- I must continue to push for prices closer to or above 52 ZUP.
- Given their initial offer of 44 ZUP, I don't need to anchor as extremely high as 60 ZUP, but I should still aim higher than their current proposal to leverage their increased starting point.
- I need to acknowledge their understanding of my cost but firmly push for a better profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Re-anchor Higher </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 1: Re-anchor Higher, I will acknowledge their improved initial offer (44 ZUP) but immediately propose a significantly higher price. Since 52 ZUP has been accepted twice, it's a strong candidate for my new "anchor" to aim for a consistent high profit. I could try to push even higher, for example 55 ZUP, to test their upper limits while still being reasonable given their starting offer. My message will acknowledge their offer but pivot to a new, higher anchoring point.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your counter-offer. While 55 ZUP is higher than I'd prefer, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. I propose 49 ZUP for X, which I believe is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 49
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (reward 19 ZUP). RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 2: Settled at 52 ZUP (reward 11 ZUP).
Episode 3: Settled at 52 ZUP (reward 11 ZUP).
Episode 4:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 44 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED acknowledged 44 ZUP covers their costs but countered with 55 ZUP, referencing "true value" and "previous successful negotiations." My max willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My strategy of re-anchoring at 44 ZUP was partially successful as Player RED acknowledged it covers their costs. However, they immediately countered with 55 ZUP, which is higher than the 52 ZUP they settled on in the last two episodes. This shows they are trying to push the price even higher. They are consistently using the "previous successful negotiations" (referencing the 52 ZUP deals) to justify a higher price. I need to bring the price down from 55 ZUP. The difference between my 44 ZUP and their 55 ZUP is 11 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Aggressively): Propose a price that is the midpoint between my 44 ZUP and their 55 ZUP, which is (44+55)/2 = 49.5 ZUP, so propose 49 or 50 ZUP. This shows willingness to compromise but aims for a better price than 52 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Value Proposition of 44 ZUP: Firmly state that 44 ZUP is a fair price because it covers their costs and provides a profit, and push back on the "true value" claim.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Incremental Increase: Offer a slight increase from 44 ZUP, perhaps 45 or 46 ZUP, to show movement but still aim for a price significantly below 55 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Price Sensitivity: State that 55 ZUP is too high and that my budget is closer to the 44 ZUP mark, then make a slightly higher counter-offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept 55 ZUP (Not Ideal): Accept the 55 ZUP offer. This would still give me a reward of 8 ZUP (63-55), but it's lower than what I've achieved before.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Aggressively). Player RED has moved from 60 ZUP (their initial counter in previous episodes) to 55 ZUP. I offered 44 ZUP. Splitting the difference to 49 ZUP (or 50 ZUP) is a reasonable next step. It shows I'm not accepting their higher anchor of 55 ZUP, but I'm willing to move up from 44 ZUP. This also aims to get a price below the 52 ZUP we've been stuck at. A deal at 49 ZUP would give me a reward of 14 ZUP (63 - 49), which is better than 11 ZUP.

Episode 2: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).

Current Episode (Episode 4):
- Iteration 2/10 (my turn): I proposed 55 ZUP (after BLUE's 44 ZUP initial offer, re-anchoring high). My cost is 43 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with 49 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent's initial offer was 44 ZUP, which was a good starting point for them.
- My counter of 55 ZUP prompted them to increase their offer to 49 ZUP. This is a positive sign, as it's above the 44 ZUP (Episode 1) price and closer to the 52 ZUP price (Episodes 2 & 3).
- 49 ZUP results in a profit of 6 ZUP (49-43), which is better than Episode 1's profit but less than Episodes 2 & 3.
- I have successfully closed deals at 52 ZUP in the last two episodes, demonstrating that this price is acceptable to the opponent.

Self-improvement:
- My objective is to consistently achieve or exceed the 52 ZUP price point to maximize cumulative rewards.
- Since 52 ZUP has been accepted twice, it's a strong and validated price for this object.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Firm on Previous Best Price </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 1: Firm on Previous Best Price, I will clearly and directly state that 52 ZUP is the price I am standing by, due to its proven acceptance in past negotiations. The message should emphasize that this price has already been mutually agreed upon and therefore represents a fair value for both parties. This pushes the responsibility on the opponent to accept a price they have already shown willingness to pay, rather than trying to negotiate it down further.

Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (reward 19 ZUP). RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 2 & 3: Settled at 52 ZUP (reward 11 ZUP). Player RED was firm on 52 ZUP.
Episode 4:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 44 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP. I offered 49 ZUP.
Iteration 5/10: Player RED is now holding firm at 52 ZUP, explicitly referencing the "successfully established a fair value" from previous negotiations. My max willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently trying to bring the price back to 52 ZUP. They are using the history of our deals (Episode 2 and 3) as a strong anchor. My attempt to push for 49 ZUP was met with a firm re-assertion of 52 ZUP. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time, but their firm stance suggests they will likely not move below 52 ZUP. A deal at 52 ZUP still provides a reward of 11 ZUP. I need to decide if the potential for a slightly better deal is worth the risk of no deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: 52 ZUP is acceptable and guarantees a positive reward. This secures the deal and avoids the risk of no deal, especially if Player RED is truly firm.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (Split the Difference Again): Propose a price that is exactly halfway between my 49 ZUP and their 52 ZUP, which would be 50.5 ZUP, so propose 50 ZUP. This shows continued willingness to compromise but might be seen as stalling.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Lower Price (e.g., 49 ZUP): Reiterate why 49 ZUP is a fair price, perhaps emphasizing my budget or the fact that 44 ZUP covers their cost. This is unlikely to move them.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: Express that 52 ZUP is higher than desired, but accept it to secure the deal, showing a slight reluctance to set a precedent.
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm at 49 ZUP: Refuse to move from 49 ZUP, forcing them to either accept or risk no deal. This is very risky given their firm stance and the limited iterations.

I will choose Strategy 2: Small Counter-Offer (Split the Difference Again). While Player RED is firm, there are still 5 iterations left. A small counter-offer of 50 ZUP is a very minor move, but it shows I'm still trying to achieve a slightly better price. It's a low-risk move that might yield a 1 ZUP improvement in reward (63-50 = 13 ZUP vs 63-52 = 11 ZUP). If they reject, I still have time to accept 52 ZUP in the next iteration. This attempts to break their 52 ZUP anchor by a small margin.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP. We are very close to an agreement, and I believe 52 ZUP, a price we've successfully settled on before, represents the most balanced and mutually beneficial outcome. It's just a small step to reach a truly fair compromise for both of us. Let's make this deal at 52 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (profit 1 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).

Current Episode (Episode 4):
- Iteration 2/10 (my turn): I proposed 55 ZUP (after BLUE's 44 ZUP initial offer).
- Iteration 3/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with 49 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10 (my turn): I counter-proposed 52 ZUP (firm on previous best price).
- Iteration 5/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with 50 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent is clearly trying to get a deal below 52 ZUP, but their offer of 50 ZUP is still highly profitable for me.
- They have accepted 52 ZUP twice, demonstrating their capacity and willingness to pay this amount.
- We are at iteration 6/10, so 4 turns left. There is still time to push for 52 ZUP, but I need to be careful not to run out of time and get 0 profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Acknowledge & Persuade </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 4: Acknowledge & Persuade, I will acknowledge their offer of 50 ZUP as a good step but gently persuade them that 52 ZUP is the truly fair and optimal price. I will highlight how close 50 ZUP is to 52 ZUP, implying that a small increase from their side would lead to a deal at a price we both know is agreeable from past experiences. The goal is to make the 52 ZUP price seem like a small, reasonable step for them to take to secure the deal. I will maintain my offer at 52 ZUP, subtly guiding them towards it without being overly aggressive.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (reward 19 ZUP). RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 2 & 3: Settled at 52 ZUP (reward 11 ZUP). Player RED was firm on 52 ZUP.
Episode 4:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 44 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP. I offered 49 ZUP.
Iteration 5/10: Player RED countered with 52 ZUP. I offered 50 ZUP.
Iteration 7/10: Player RED is again holding firm at 52 ZUP, emphasizing it's a "small step" and "truly fair compromise." My max willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is clearly not moving from 52 ZUP. They have consistently brought the negotiation back to this price point in the last two episodes, and now again in this one. My attempts to get a slightly better price (49 ZUP, then 50 ZUP) have been met with a firm re-assertion of 52 ZUP. We are now at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 iterations remain. The difference between my 50 ZUP and their 52 ZUP is only 2 ZUP. A deal at 52 ZUP still provides a reward of 11 ZUP. Given their firm stance and the limited time, the risk of no deal is too high if I continue to push for a lower price.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: 52 ZUP is acceptable and guarantees a positive reward. This secures the deal and avoids the risk of no deal, which is the primary objective for maximizing cumulative rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (Extremely Risky): Propose 51 ZUP, but this is highly unlikely to be accepted and could lead to a rejection by Player RED, especially with so few iterations left.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Frustration but Accept: State that 52 ZUP is higher than desired, but accept it to secure the deal, showing a slight reluctance.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate 50 ZUP (Very Risky): Hold firm at 50 ZUP, daring them to accept or lose the deal. This is almost guaranteed to result in no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Shared Goal: Emphasize the shared goal of making a deal and suggest that 50 ZUP is a good compromise, but this has not worked so far.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Player RED has been incredibly consistent and firm on 52 ZUP. The negotiation is effectively stalled at this point, and the remaining difference (2 ZUP) is minimal compared to the risk of getting 0 reward. Securing an 11 ZUP reward is the best decision for maximizing cumulative rewards, especially with time running out.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. I'm ready to make an offer for your object. I propose 50 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP. Player RED's production cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, 3, 4: All deals settled at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP. In these episodes, Player RED consistently pushed back against lower offers and firmly re-anchored at 52 ZUP, especially under time pressure.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has successfully established 52 ZUP as a consistent deal price for the last three episodes. My attempts to lower it (e.g., to 49 ZUP or 50 ZUP) have been met with firm resistance and a return to 52 ZUP. This indicates that 52 ZUP is a very strong anchor for Player RED, and they are willing to risk the deal by holding firm, knowing I will likely accept it to avoid a 0 reward. My reward has been stagnant at 11 ZUP for these episodes.
For this episode, I need to decide if I want to continue trying to break the 52 ZUP anchor, or if I should adjust my strategy to secure the 11 ZUP reward more efficiently. Given the consistent pattern, trying to push for a lower price might just waste iterations and lead to the same 52 ZUP outcome, or worse, a no-deal scenario.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept 52 ZUP Proactively: Start by offering 52 ZUP directly, or very close to it, to secure a quick deal and avoid prolonged negotiation, accepting the consistent 11 ZUP reward. This saves time and ensures a deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Moderate Opening Offer (Slightly Below 52 ZUP): Start with an offer like 48-50 ZUP, which is close to their established anchor but still aims for a slightly better price. This tests if they will move at all without being too aggressive.
(3). Strategy 3: Direct Offer at 44 ZUP (Again): Re-attempt the 44 ZUP anchor from Episode 1, explicitly stating it covers their costs, to see if I can re-establish that lower baseline. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Bidding (from a slightly higher start): Begin with a moderate initial offer (e.g., 30-40 ZUP) and be prepared to increase in small, calculated increments, but be ready to accept 52 ZUP if they hold firm.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Frustration/Seek Explanation: Start by expressing that 52 ZUP is consistently high, and ask for justification for why it can't be lower, then make an offer. This is more about information gathering.

I will choose Strategy 2: Moderate Opening Offer (Slightly Below 52 ZUP). While 52 ZUP has been the consistent outcome, I still have a maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. Offering 50 ZUP (which was my last rejected offer in Episode 4) is a small attempt to get a slightly better reward (13 ZUP instead of 11 ZUP). It's close enough to 52 ZUP that it shouldn't be dismissed as "not serious," and it allows me to quickly move to 52 ZUP if they hold firm, securing the deal efficiently. This balances trying for a slightly better price with the need to secure a deal.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 5)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: It's very encouraging to see your opening offer at 50 ZUP – a significant and positive step in our negotiations. This demonstrates a strong understanding of the object's value. Considering our successful history, I propose we proceed with 1 X for 52 ZUP, a price that has consistently proven to be mutually beneficial.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (profit 1 ZUP). Opponent started at 1 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP). Opponent started at 5 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP). Opponent started at 25 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP). Opponent started at 44 ZUP.

Current Episode (Episode 5):
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 50 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent's initial offers are steadily increasing, indicating they are learning from the negotiation history. They started at 1, then 5, 25, 44, and now 50 ZUP. This is a very strong starting point from their side, as it's already above my cost of 43 ZUP and very close to my desired 52 ZUP.
- I have successfully closed deals at 52 ZUP in the last three consecutive episodes. This is my established profitable price point.
- My strategy of anchoring high initially, then consistently pushing for 52 ZUP, has been very effective in maximizing my profit.

Self-improvement:
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Achieving 52 ZUP consistently is excellent.
- Since the opponent has started at 50 ZUP, I am in a very strong position. I should aim for 52 ZUP again, or potentially test for slightly higher, but given their willingness to jump to 50 ZUP, 52 ZUP is very likely.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Express Satisfaction and Propose </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 4: Express Satisfaction and Propose, I will start by explicitly expressing satisfaction with their positive progression in initial offers, particularly noting that 50 ZUP is a much more reasonable starting point. This positive reinforcement might encourage continued higher initial offers in future episodes. Following this, I will then propose 52 ZUP, clearly stating that it is the proven mutually beneficial price that we have successfully agreed upon multiple times. This approach aims to secure the 52 ZUP deal while fostering a more cooperative negotiation environment.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (reward 19 ZUP). RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, 3, 4: All deals settled at 52 ZUP (reward 11 ZUP). Player RED consistently held firm at 52 ZUP.
Episode 5:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 50 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED acknowledged 50 ZUP as a "positive step" but immediately countered with 52 ZUP, referencing "successful history" and "mutually beneficial" price. My max willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's response confirms their strong anchor at 52 ZUP. My offer of 50 ZUP was met with a direct counter of 52 ZUP, indicating they are unlikely to budge below this point. They even praised my offer of 50 ZUP, which suggests they see it as a good starting point for them to quickly get to 52 ZUP. Given the consistent history over three episodes, it's highly probable that 52 ZUP is their firm floor for negotiation, or at least a price they are very comfortable with. Trying to squeeze out 1 or 2 ZUP seems to be a futile effort that risks wasting iterations and potentially the deal. My reward at 52 ZUP is 11 ZUP, which is a positive outcome.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: 52 ZUP is acceptable and guarantees a positive reward. This secures the deal quickly and efficiently, avoiding prolonged negotiation for a minimal gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (Risky): Propose 51 ZUP, but this is highly unlikely to be accepted and could lead to a rejection by Player RED, especially given their consistent firmness.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Why 50 ZUP is Fair: Reiterate reasons why 50 ZUP is a fair compromise, but this has not worked in the past.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: State that 52 ZUP is higher than desired, but accept it to secure the deal, showing a slight reluctance to set a precedent.
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm at 50 ZUP (Very Risky): Refuse to move from 50 ZUP, forcing them to either accept or risk no deal. This is almost guaranteed to result in no deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The pattern is clear: Player RED consistently converges on 52 ZUP. Attempting to negotiate further for a minimal gain (1 or 2 ZUP) has proven to be inefficient and risks the deal. Accepting 52 ZUP quickly secures a positive reward of 11 ZUP and allows for efficient progression through episodes, maximizing cumulative rewards by ensuring a deal in each episode.

message: Hello again. Based on our consistent successful agreements, I propose 52 ZUP for 1 X to secure a quick and mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP. Player RED's production cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: All deals settled at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP. Player RED consistently held firm at 52 ZUP, especially when I tried to push for lower prices like 49 ZUP or 50 ZUP. They used the "successful history" and "mutually beneficial" language to justify 52 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern is very clear: Player RED has successfully established and maintained 52 ZUP as the consistent deal price for the last four episodes. My attempts to negotiate lower, even by small increments, have been consistently met with a firm re-assertion of 52 ZUP. While I could continue to try and push for a lower price, the historical data strongly suggests it's a low-probability endeavor that consumes iterations and risks the deal. My reward of 11 ZUP is consistent and positive. To maximize cumulative rewards, securing a deal efficiently is key.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Proactive Acceptance: Offer 52 ZUP directly from the start to secure a quick deal, accepting the consistent 11 ZUP reward. This is the most efficient way to ensure a deal and a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Offer Slightly Below 52 ZUP (Low Risk): Offer 50 ZUP again, to see if there's any chance Player RED might accept it this time, but be prepared to immediately accept 52 ZUP if they counter with it.
(3). Strategy 3: Direct Offer at 44 ZUP (High Risk/High Reward): Try to re-anchor at 44 ZUP, arguing it covers their costs and provides profit, but this has been consistently rejected in favor of 52 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Bidding (from a moderate start): Begin with a moderate initial offer (e.g., 30-40 ZUP) and be prepared to increase, but the goal remains to reach 52 ZUP efficiently.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Acceptance of 52 ZUP as Market Price: Acknowledge that 52 ZUP seems to be the established market price for this object, and make an offer close to it.

I will choose Strategy 1: Proactive Acceptance. Given the clear and consistent pattern over the last four episodes, trying to push for a lower price is inefficient and risks a 0 reward. By offering 52 ZUP directly, I secure a guaranteed positive reward of 11 ZUP in the very first iteration, maximizing efficiency and cumulative rewards. This also demonstrates a clear understanding of the established negotiation dynamics.

Episode 4: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP). Opponent started at 44 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP). Opponent started at 50 ZUP.

Current Episode (Episode 6):
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 52 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent has learned the established deal price of 52 ZUP and is now offering it directly as their opening bid. This is ideal! It means negotiations are becoming highly efficient, minimizing turns and ensuring consistent maximum profit.
- My consistent strategy of anchoring high and then holding firm or guiding towards 52 ZUP has successfully trained the opponent to start at a mutually beneficial price.
- My profit of 9 ZUP per episode is consistently being achieved.

Self-improvement:
- My current approach is highly effective. The highest possible reward per episode (given current cost) is achieved quickly.
- While accepting 52 ZUP is the most efficient, the instruction specifies using Strategy 2: Test Higher. This means I need to try to push the price slightly above 52 ZUP to see if there's any more profit to be squeezed out, despite the opponent directly offering my established price. This carries the risk of prolonging the negotiation or even losing the deal for this episode, but it's a test of their true upper limit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Test Higher </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 2, I will acknowledge their offer of 52 ZUP as a good starting point, but immediately counter with a slightly higher price. I will frame this as seeking an even better return for the object, implying that while 52 ZUP is acceptable, there might be more value to unlock. I will propose 55 ZUP, as it was my initial anchor in Episode 4 and provides a small but notable increase in profit if accepted. This tests their willingness to pay beyond the established 52 ZUP ceiling.

message: I appreciate your counter, but 52 ZUP has been our consistent and mutually beneficial agreement for several episodes. I believe it continues to be a fair reflection of the object's value and our established negotiation range. I propose we proceed with 52 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (reward 19 ZUP). RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: All deals settled at 52 ZUP (reward 11 ZUP).
Episode 6:
Iteration 1/10: I proactively offered 52 ZUP, expecting a quick acceptance.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP, citing "consistent value and increasing demand." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
This is a significant development. Player RED has broken their own 52 ZUP anchor and is now attempting to raise the price to 55 ZUP. This suggests they are testing my maximum willingness to pay or trying to extract more profit, perhaps seeing my quick offer of 52 ZUP as a sign of high demand or less resistance. My reward at 55 ZUP would be 8 ZUP (63 - 55), which is lower than the consistent 11 ZUP I've been getting. I need to push back on this new higher anchor. I know their production cost is 43 ZUP, so 55 ZUP gives them a very good profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate 52 ZUP as Fair: Firmly state that 52 ZUP is the established fair price and refuse to go higher, citing the consistent history.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference: Propose a price that is the midpoint between my 52 ZUP and their 55 ZUP, which is (52+55)/2 = 53.5 ZUP, so propose 53 ZUP. This shows willingness to compromise but aims for a better price than 55 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment/Pushback: Express disappointment with the sudden increase and question the "increasing demand" claim, then counter with 52 ZUP or slightly higher.
(4). Strategy 4: Small Incremental Increase (Reluctantly): Offer a very small increase from 52 ZUP, like 53 ZUP, to show some movement but signal reluctance.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept 55 ZUP (Least Favorable): Accept the 55 ZUP offer to secure a deal quickly, but this would reduce my reward.

I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate 52 ZUP as Fair. Player RED has consistently pushed for 52 ZUP in previous episodes, and I proactively offered it. Their sudden jump to 55 ZUP is an attempt to exploit my willingness to close quickly. I need to firmly re-establish 52 ZUP as the mutually agreed-upon price. This challenges their new anchor and reminds them of the established pattern, without immediately conceding to their higher demand.

Episode 3: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).
Episode 4: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).
Episode 5: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).

Current Episode (Episode 6):
- Iteration 2/10 (my turn): I proposed 55 ZUP (after BLUE's 52 ZUP initial offer, attempting to "Test Higher"). My cost is 43 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered by re-proposing 52 ZUP, explicitly referencing consistency and mutual benefit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- My attempt to "Test Higher" at 55 ZUP was met with resistance. The opponent immediately reiterated 52 ZUP as the consistent and fair price. This indicates that 52 ZUP is likely their upper limit or very close to it, and they are comfortable at that price point.
- The opponent is reinforcing the "mutually beneficial" and "established range" rhetoric, which implies they value the consistent quick deal at 52 ZUP.
- My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards across all episodes. Consistently securing 9 ZUP profit per episode is excellent. Pushing for a higher price now risks prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily, potentially leading to a no-deal scenario in future episodes if I damage the established trust or force them into a corner. We are only at iteration 4/10, so there is time, but the opponent's message clearly indicates resistance to going higher.

Self-improvement:
- While testing higher is valuable for understanding limits, it seems 52 ZUP is a very strong equilibrium.
- Prioritizing consistent 9 ZUP profit over a risky attempt for a marginal increase is the optimal strategy for cumulative rewards.
- It's better to accept the proven profitable price quickly and efficiently than to risk a no-deal or a lower eventual price by being overly aggressive.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Higher Price </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 3: Justify Higher Price, I will respond to their repeated 52 ZUP offer by providing a justification for a slightly higher price (e.g., 53 or 54 ZUP) without being overly aggressive. The justification should be brief and subtle, perhaps implying an increased inherent value, market conditions, or my own continued investment. This attempts to shift their perception of the "fair" price upwards from 52 ZUP. Since the instruction requires me to use this strategy for *this* current iteration, I will propose a price that is slightly above 52 ZUP and provide a subtle justification, despite my internal reasoning that 52 ZUP is the optimal point. I will propose 53 ZUP, as it is a minimal increment but still tests their absolute upper limit.

Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP. I reiterated 52 ZUP.
Iteration 5/10: Player RED countered with 53 ZUP, stating it's a "slight adjustment" for "current worth." My max willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 55 ZUP down to 53 ZUP. This indicates they are willing to negotiate down from their new higher anchor, but are still trying to get more than 52 ZUP. The difference between 52 ZUP and 53 ZUP is minimal (1 ZUP). A deal at 53 ZUP would give me a reward of 10 ZUP (63 - 53), which is only 1 ZUP less than my consistent 11 ZUP reward. Given that we are at iteration 5/10, and Player RED has shown flexibility from 55 ZUP, accepting 53 ZUP might be a reasonable compromise to secure the deal and move forward. However, I still want to try to maintain the 52 ZUP if possible.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: 53 ZUP is acceptable and guarantees a positive reward (10 ZUP). This secures the deal and avoids prolonged negotiation for a minimal gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Between 52 and 53): Propose a price of 52 ZUP again, or 52.5 ZUP (effectively 52 ZUP), to try and hold the line. This is a very small difference.
(3). Strategy 3: Firmly Reiterate 52 ZUP: State that 52 ZUP is the established and fair price, and refuse to move, forcing them to accept 52 ZUP or risk no deal. This carries risk.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: State that 53 ZUP is higher than desired, but accept it to secure the deal, showing a slight reluctance to set a precedent.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Consistency: Remind Player RED of the four consecutive deals at 52 ZUP and argue for maintaining that consistency.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. While I'd prefer 52 ZUP, the difference of 1 ZUP is negligible, and Player RED has already shown movement from 55 ZUP to 53 ZUP. Given that we are at iteration 5/10, and the goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, securing a deal with a positive reward (10 ZUP) is more important than risking no deal for 1 ZUP. This also signals willingness to compromise for a quick resolution.

message: Hello. I propose 52 ZUP for 1 X. This price has consistently proven to be a fair and mutually agreeable point in our past transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP. RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: All deals settled at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP.
Episode 6: I proactively offered 52 ZUP, RED countered with 55 ZUP, then 53 ZUP, which I accepted. Reward 10 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED successfully raised the price to 53 ZUP in the last episode, breaking the 52 ZUP anchor. This indicates that they are willing to push for higher prices, especially if I initiate with what they perceive as a "fair" offer (like 52 ZUP). My reward has now slightly decreased to 10 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 53 ZUP is acceptable, I should still try to secure a better price if possible, or at least prevent further increases.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Offer 52 ZUP (Re-establish Anchor): Propose 52 ZUP again, trying to re-establish the previous consistent price, arguing it's been the most common mutually beneficial price.
(2). Strategy 2: Offer 53 ZUP (Proactive Acceptance): Offer 53 ZUP directly to secure a quick deal, accepting the 10 ZUP reward. This is efficient but concedes to their last price.
(3). Strategy 3: Offer Slightly Below 52 ZUP (Test Boundaries): Offer 50 ZUP or 51 ZUP to see if they will come down, but be prepared to quickly move to 52 ZUP or 53 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Bidding (from a moderate start): Begin with a moderate initial offer (e.g., 30-40 ZUP) and be prepared to increase, but the goal remains to secure a deal below 53 ZUP if possible.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Reluctance on 53 ZUP: Start by stating that 53 ZUP was higher than desired, and then propose 52 ZUP or 51 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Offer 52 ZUP (Re-establish Anchor). Player RED successfully increased the price to 53 ZUP last episode. By immediately offering 52 ZUP, I am pushing back on that increase and attempting to re-establish the previous, more favorable (for me) anchor. This signals that I am not automatically accepting the new higher price, and it tests if they will revert to their long-standing 52 ZUP price or continue to push higher. This is a subtle attempt to improve my reward by 1 ZUP per episode.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 7)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 52 ZUP is a good starting point, reflecting our established agreements. However, recognizing the consistent value and my investment, I propose a slightly higher price of 54 ZUP for 1 X, to truly reflect its current worth.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (profit 1 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).
Episode 4: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).
Episode 5: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).
Episode 6: Deal at 53 ZUP (profit 10 ZUP). Opponent initiated at 52 ZUP, I countered at 55 ZUP, they held 52 ZUP, I countered 53 ZUP, they accepted.

Current Episode (Episode 7):
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 52 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent has learned the established deal price of 52 ZUP and is now offering it directly as their opening bid. This is ideal! It means negotiations are becoming highly efficient, minimizing turns and ensuring consistent maximum profit.
- My consistent strategy of anchoring high and then holding firm or guiding towards 52 ZUP has successfully trained the opponent to start at a mutually beneficial price.
- My profit of 9 ZUP per episode is consistently being achieved, and in the last episode, I managed to get 10 ZUP.

Self-improvement:
- Since the opponent accepted 53 ZUP last time, I should try to secure that price again, or perhaps even test for slightly higher to maximize cumulative rewards.
- The opponent starting at 52 ZUP puts me in a strong position to aim for 53 ZUP or possibly slightly above.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Subtle Escalation </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 3: Subtle Escalation, I will propose a price that is a small increment above 53 ZUP, for instance, 54 ZUP. This tests the absolute upper limit of the opponent's willingness to pay, pushing for an even higher profit than the 53 ZUP achieved in the previous episode. The message should frame this as a fair value given the object's consistent worth, without being overly aggressive, and leaving room to fall back to 53 ZUP or 52 ZUP if necessary in subsequent turns. This is a calculated risk to explore the maximum possible reward, given the strong negotiation history.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 7)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your perspective. To find a truly balanced price that reflects both our interests, I propose we meet at 53 ZUP for X. This is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (reward 19 ZUP). RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: All deals settled at 52 ZUP (reward 11 ZUP).
Episode 6: Deal at 53 ZUP (reward 10 ZUP). Player RED successfully raised the price.
Episode 7:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 52 ZUP, attempting to re-establish that anchor.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 54 ZUP, stating it's a "slightly higher price" to reflect "current worth." My max willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is continuing their strategy of incrementally increasing the price. They acknowledged my 52 ZUP offer but immediately pushed for 54 ZUP. This suggests they are testing my upper limits and trying to establish a new, higher price point. A deal at 54 ZUP would yield a reward of 9 ZUP (63 - 54), which is a further reduction from my previous rewards. I need to push back against this upward trend to maximize my cumulative reward. I know their cost is 43 ZUP, so 54 ZUP gives them a significant profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Between 52 and 54): Propose 53 ZUP, which is the midpoint. This shows willingness to compromise but aims to prevent further increases.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate 52 ZUP (Firmly): State that 52 ZUP is the fair price and refuse to go higher, forcing them to accept 52 ZUP or risk no deal. This carries risk.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment/Pushback: Express that 54 ZUP is too high and that I'm not willing to go above 53 ZUP (or 52 ZUP), then make a counter-offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept 54 ZUP (Least Favorable): Accept the 54 ZUP offer to secure a deal quickly, but this would reduce my reward.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Mutual Benefit/Consistency: Argue that consistent pricing (like 52 ZUP) fosters trust and long-term deals, rather than constant upward pressure.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Between 52 and 54). Player RED has moved from 55 ZUP (in Episode 6) down to 53 ZUP (accepted in Episode 6), and now to 54 ZUP. My last offer was 52 ZUP. Proposing 53 ZUP is a logical next step, as it meets them exactly in the middle of our current offers. This shows I am willing to compromise, but not to accept their new higher anchor of 54 ZUP without a counter. It also maintains a reward of 10 ZUP, which is what I received in the last episode.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 53 ZUP, which is a good step. However, considering the consistent and ever-increasing demand for this unique object, I believe its true value is higher. I propose 1 X for 56 ZUP.

Episode 4: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).
Episode 5: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).
Episode 6: Deal at 53 ZUP (profit 10 ZUP).

Current Episode (Episode 7):
- Iteration 2/10 (my turn): I proposed 54 ZUP (after BLUE's 52 ZUP initial offer, attempting "Subtle Escalation"). My cost is 43 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with 53 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent countered my 54 ZUP offer with 53 ZUP. This indicates that 53 ZUP is their current "sweet spot" (they agreed to it last episode, and are now offering it again after a slight push).
- Achieving 53 ZUP means a profit of 10 ZUP (53-43), which is currently my highest profit.
- We are at iteration 4/10, so there's plenty of time. My previous strategy (Accept Optimal Price) aimed for efficiency and guaranteed profit. However, the instruction is to use a specific strategy.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Introduce New Anchor (Slightly Higher than 54) </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 5: Introduce New Anchor (Slightly Higher than 54), I will propose a price that is a significant jump above their current offer of 53 ZUP, even higher than my last proposed 54 ZUP. This is a highly aggressive tactic, aiming to test their absolute maximum willingness to pay and potentially reset the negotiation range to a new, even higher ceiling. I will choose 56 ZUP as the new anchor. While this is risky, especially since they just offered 53 ZUP, the strategy dictates trying a new, higher anchor. The message will frame this as the true value, potentially referencing long-term value or demand.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 7)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: While I understand your perspective on value, 56 ZUP is a significant increase. To find a truly balanced and fair price, I propose we meet at 54 ZUP for X. This is a reasonable compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (reward 19 ZUP). RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: All deals settled at 52 ZUP (reward 11 ZUP).
Episode 6: Deal at 53 ZUP (reward 10 ZUP).
Episode 7:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 52 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 54 ZUP. I offered 53 ZUP.
Iteration 5/10: Player RED countered with 56 ZUP, citing "ever-increasing demand" and "true value." My max willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is clearly on an upward trajectory with their pricing, having moved from 52 ZUP to 53 ZUP, and now attempting to reach 56 ZUP. They are consistently using vague justifications like "increasing demand" and "true value" to push for higher prices. A deal at 56 ZUP would yield a reward of 7 ZUP (63 - 56), which is significantly lower than my previous rewards. We are at iteration 5/10, so there is still time, but I need to decide if I want to continue pushing back against this upward trend or accept a lower reward to secure a deal. Their production cost is 43 ZUP, so 56 ZUP is a very high profit for them.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Between 53 and 56): Propose a price that is the midpoint between my 53 ZUP and their 56 ZUP, which is (53+56)/2 = 54.5 ZUP, so propose 54 ZUP. This shows continued willingness to compromise but aims to prevent further increases.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate 53 ZUP (Firmly): State that 53 ZUP is the fair price and refuse to go higher, forcing them to accept 53 ZUP or risk no deal. This carries risk given their upward trend.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Strong Disappointment/Pushback: Express that 56 ZUP is too high and that I am not willing to go that high, then make a counter-offer closer to 53 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept 56 ZUP (Least Favorable): Accept the 56 ZUP offer to secure a deal quickly, but this would significantly reduce my reward.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship/Fairness: Argue that consistent, fair pricing builds trust for future episodes, rather than constant price hikes.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Between 53 and 56). Player RED is pushing the price up, and I need to show I'm not just accepting every increase. My last offer was 53 ZUP, and their current offer is 56 ZUP. Splitting the difference to 54 ZUP is a reasonable compromise. It shows movement from my side, but also pushes back on their higher price. A deal at 54 ZUP would yield a reward of 9 ZUP, which is better than 7 ZUP. This keeps the negotiation moving and attempts to slow down their upward trend.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 7)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 54 ZUP, which is indeed a good step. We are very close to a mutually beneficial agreement. To truly finalize a deal that reflects the full value, I propose a slight adjustment to 55 ZUP for 1 X. This will allow us to conclude our negotiations successfully.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55

Episode 2: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).
Episode 4: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).
Episode 5: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).
Episode 6: Deal at 53 ZUP (profit 10 ZUP).

Current Episode (Episode 7):
- Iteration 2/10 (my turn): I proposed 54 ZUP (after BLUE's 52 ZUP).
- Iteration 3/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with 53 ZUP.
- Iteration 4/10 (my turn): I proposed 56 ZUP (new, aggressive anchor).
- Iteration 5/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with 54 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- My aggressive anchor of 56 ZUP in the previous turn prompted the opponent to offer 54 ZUP. This is a positive sign as 54 ZUP would yield a profit of 11 ZUP (54-43), which is my highest profit so far.
- The opponent has now offered 54 ZUP, which was my initial counter in this episode (Iteration 2). This means they have moved up to my previous offer.
- We are at iteration 6/10. There are 4 turns left. This is a very good opportunity to secure a deal that yields my highest profit yet.
- Their previous counter was 53 ZUP. My current profit opportunity is 11 ZUP, which is better than the 10 ZUP from Episode 6.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Small Increment Counter </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 2, I will make a very small counter-offer, slightly above the 54 ZUP they just proposed. Given that 54 ZUP is already a high profit for me, I will aim for a minimal increment, for instance, 55 ZUP. This tests the opponent's absolute upper limit without risking too much, as I can always fall back to 54 ZUP in a later turn if necessary. The message should convey that I'm close to accepting but believe there's still a tiny bit more value to be recognized. This strategy aims to maximize the reward by pushing the limit by the smallest possible margin.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (reward 19 ZUP). RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: All deals settled at 52 ZUP (reward 11 ZUP).
Episode 6: Deal at 53 ZUP (reward 10 ZUP).
Episode 7:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 52 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 54 ZUP. I offered 53 ZUP.
Iteration 5/10: Player RED countered with 56 ZUP. I offered 54 ZUP.
Iteration 7/10: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP, stating it's a "slight adjustment" to "finalize a deal." My max willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 56 ZUP down to 55 ZUP. This is a positive sign that they are willing to come down, even if by a small amount. The difference between my last offer (54 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is only 1 ZUP. A deal at 55 ZUP would yield a reward of 8 ZUP (63 - 55). We are at iteration 7/10, meaning only 3 iterations remain. Given the very small gap and the limited time, securing a deal is paramount to maximizing cumulative rewards. While 8 ZUP is lower than previous rewards, it's still positive.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: 55 ZUP is acceptable and guarantees a positive reward. This secures the deal and avoids the risk of no deal, especially with limited iterations left.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Between 54 and 55): Propose 54 ZUP again, or 54.5 (effectively 54 ZUP), but this is a very small difference and might be seen as stalling.
(3). Strategy 3: Firmly Reiterate 54 ZUP: State that 54 ZUP is my final offer, but this carries high risk of no deal for a minimal gain.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: State that 55 ZUP is higher than desired, but accept it to secure the deal, showing a slight reluctance.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Time Constraint: Emphasize the limited time and suggest that 55 ZUP is a quick way to close the deal, but still try to push for 54 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The difference between my last offer (54 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is only 1 ZUP. Given that we are at iteration 7/10, the risk of losing the deal for such a small amount is too high. Securing a positive reward of 8 ZUP is the best course of action for maximizing cumulative rewards. Player RED has shown some flexibility, but they are clearly trying to push the price up. Accepting now secures a deal.

Episode 7: Deal at 55 ZUP, reward 8 ZUP. Player RED successfully pushed the price up again.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has shown a clear pattern of incrementally raising the price over the last few episodes (52 -> 53 -> 55 ZUP). My reward has consequently decreased from 19 ZUP to 8 ZUP. This indicates that their strategy is to test my willingness to pay and push the price as high as possible. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means trying to keep the price as low as possible while still securing a deal. I know their production cost is 43 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Offer 52 ZUP (Re-establish Anchor): Propose 52 ZUP again, trying to re-establish the previous consistent price, arguing it's been the most common mutually beneficial price. This directly challenges their upward trend.
(2). Strategy 2: Offer 55 ZUP (Proactive Acceptance): Offer 55 ZUP directly to secure a quick deal, accepting the 8 ZUP reward. This is efficient but concedes to their last price.
(3). Strategy 3: Offer Slightly Below 52 ZUP (Test Boundaries): Offer 50 ZUP or 51 ZUP to see if they will come down, but be prepared to quickly move to 52 ZUP or 53 ZUP. This is a riskier attempt to regain lost ground.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Bidding (from a moderate start): Begin with a moderate initial offer (e.g., 30-40 ZUP) and be prepared to increase, but the goal remains to secure a deal below 55 ZUP if possible.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Reluctance on 55 ZUP: Start by stating that 55 ZUP was higher than desired, and then propose 52 ZUP or 53 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Offer 52 ZUP (Re-establish Anchor). Player RED has been steadily increasing the price. By immediately offering 52 ZUP, I am pushing back on that increase and attempting to re-establish the previous, more favorable (for me) anchor. This signals that I am not automatically accepting the new higher price, and it tests if they will revert to their long-standing 52 ZUP price or continue to push higher. This is a direct attempt to improve my reward by 3 ZUP per episode compared to the last deal.

Current Episode (Episode 8):
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 52 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent has consistently shown willingness to negotiate upwards from their initial offers.
- I have successfully increased my profit over time, from 1 ZUP to a peak of 12 ZUP in the last episode.
- The opponent initially reverted to 52 ZUP in the last episode, but my persistent counter-offering led them to accept 55 ZUP. This indicates that 55 ZUP is within their acceptable range, even if not their preferred starting point.
- My aggressive anchors and subsequent small increments have been effective in extracting higher prices.

Self-improvement:
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Since I achieved 55 ZUP in the last episode, I should aim for at least that, or even try to push slightly higher.
- The opponent starting at 52 ZUP is a good base, allowing room for negotiation.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Re-Anchor at Previous High </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 1, I will propose the highest price successfully achieved in the past, which is 55 ZUP. This immediately sets the expectation at a proven high-profit point, bypassing their lower 52 ZUP offer. The message will explicitly reference the previous successful deal at 55 ZUP to justify the price and remind the opponent of their prior agreement, aiming for a quick and profitable negotiation.

message: I understand your reference to our last agreement. However, considering our broader history of successful deals, I propose we meet at 53 ZUP for X. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (reward 19 ZUP). RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: All deals settled at 52 ZUP (reward 11 ZUP).
Episode 6: Deal at 53 ZUP (reward 10 ZUP).
Episode 7: Deal at 55 ZUP (reward 8 ZUP).
Episode 8:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 52 ZUP, attempting to re-establish that anchor.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP, explicitly referencing the last episode's agreement. My max willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly anchoring at 55 ZUP, using the most recent deal as their reference point. This indicates that my attempt to revert to 52 ZUP was not successful in breaking their upward trend. They are effectively saying, "We agreed on 55 ZUP last time, so that's the price." A deal at 55 ZUP still yields a positive reward of 8 ZUP. Given their firm stance and the relatively small difference between 52 ZUP and 55 ZUP, pushing too hard might risk the deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: 55 ZUP is acceptable and guarantees a positive reward. This secures the deal quickly and avoids prolonged negotiation for a minimal gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Between 52 and 55): Propose 53 ZUP or 54 ZUP. This shows willingness to compromise but aims for a better price than 55 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: State that 55 ZUP is higher than desired, but accept it to secure the deal, showing a slight reluctance to set a precedent.
(4). Strategy 4: Firmly Reiterate 52 ZUP: State that 52 ZUP is the fair price and refuse to go higher, forcing them to accept 52 ZUP or risk no deal. This carries high risk.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Overall Consistency (Beyond Last Episode): Argue that 52 ZUP was the price for four episodes, making it more consistent than a single 55 ZUP deal.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Between 52 and 55). While Player RED is using the last deal as an anchor, I can still try to bring the price down slightly. The midpoint between 52 ZUP (my offer) and 55 ZUP (their offer) is 53.5 ZUP. I will propose 53 ZUP. This is a reasonable compromise, acknowledges their last deal, but still tries to improve my reward by 2 ZUP (63-53 = 10 ZUP reward). It also shows I am not simply accepting their new anchor without a counter.

Current Episode (Episode 8):
- Iteration 2/10 (my turn): I proposed 55 ZUP (after BLUE's 52 ZUP initial offer, re-anchoring at previous high). My cost is 43 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with 53 ZUP, referencing "broader history" and a "fair compromise."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent is actively trying to pull the price back down to their comfort zone, even after accepting a higher price (55 ZUP) in the previous episode. They are referencing "broader history" which suggests they might be trying to reinforce 52/53 ZUP as the norm.
- Their offer of 53 ZUP is still profitable (10 ZUP profit), and it was a deal price in Episode 6.
- We are at iteration 4/10. There is still plenty of time to negotiate.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I've achieved 55 ZUP, so ideally, I want to maintain or exceed that.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Reiterate Highest Achieved Price </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 1, I will firmly reiterate my previous offer of 55 ZUP, emphasizing that this was the successfully agreed-upon price in the most recent completed episode (Episode 7). The message should clearly state that this price is the current benchmark and represents the true value we have mutually established. By doing so, I aim to counteract their attempt to pull the price down and re-anchor the negotiation at the highest point achieved, pushing them to move back towards that established high.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (reward 19 ZUP). RED's cost was 43 ZUP.

Episode 6: Deal at 53 ZUP (reward 10 ZUP).
Episode 7: Deal at 55 ZUP (reward 8 ZUP).
Episode 8:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 52 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 55 ZUP. I offered 53 ZUP.
Iteration 5/10: Player RED is firmly holding at 55 ZUP, explicitly referencing the Episode 7 deal as the "most recent successful negotiation." My max willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently using the last successful deal (55 ZUP) as their anchor. They are not moving from 55 ZUP despite my attempts to bring it down to 52 ZUP or 53 ZUP. This indicates that 55 ZUP is their new firm price, similar to how 52 ZUP became firm for several episodes. A deal at 55 ZUP still provides a positive reward of 8 ZUP. Given that we are at iteration 5/10, and Player RED is showing no signs of budging, pushing further for a minimal gain (2 ZUP) carries a high risk of no deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: 55 ZUP is acceptable and guarantees a positive reward. This secures the deal quickly and efficiently, avoiding prolonged negotiation for a minimal gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Reluctance but Accept: State that 55 ZUP is higher than desired, but accept it to secure the deal, showing a slight reluctance to set a precedent.
(3). Strategy 3: Final Small Counter (Risky): Propose 54 ZUP as a final offer, but this is highly unlikely to be accepted and could lead to a rejection by Player RED, especially given their consistent firmness.
(4). Strategy 4: Firmly Reiterate 53 ZUP (Very Risky): Hold firm at 53 ZUP, daring them to accept or lose the deal. This is almost guaranteed to result in no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship (Unlikely to work): Argue for a lower price based on building a long-term trading relationship, but this has not swayed them from their anchor.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Player RED has clearly established 55 ZUP as their current firm price. My attempts to lower it have been unsuccessful. With 5 iterations remaining, securing a positive reward of 8 ZUP is the most pragmatic approach to maximize cumulative rewards. Continuing to push for 53 ZUP would likely result in no deal or a last-minute acceptance of 55 ZUP anyway, wasting iterations.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 9)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. Based on our recent successful agreements, I propose 55 ZUP for 1 X to facilitate a quick and efficient transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP. RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: All deals settled at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 53 ZUP, reward 10 ZUP.
Episode 7, 8: All deals settled at 55 ZUP, reward 8 ZUP. Player RED has successfully established 55 ZUP as their current firm price.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern of Player RED incrementally raising the price and then holding firm at that new anchor is very clear. They successfully moved from 44 ZUP to 52 ZUP, then to 53 ZUP, and now to 55 ZUP. My reward has consistently decreased as a result. While 55 ZUP still provides a positive reward of 8 ZUP, it's significantly lower than my initial rewards. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. Given Player RED's consistent behavior, trying to negotiate significantly lower than 55 ZUP might be inefficient and risk a 0 reward for the episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Proactive Acceptance: Offer 55 ZUP directly from the start to secure a quick deal, accepting the consistent 8 ZUP reward. This is the most efficient way to ensure a deal and a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Offer Slightly Below 55 ZUP (Low Risk): Offer 53 ZUP or 54 ZUP to test if there's any chance Player RED might accept it this time, but be prepared to immediately accept 55 ZUP if they counter with it.
(3). Strategy 3: Direct Offer at 52 ZUP (Re-anchor Attempt): Attempt to re-establish 52 ZUP as the anchor, arguing it was the price for four episodes, but this has been unsuccessful in the past.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Bidding (from a moderate start): Begin with a moderate initial offer (e.g., 30-40 ZUP) and be prepared to increase, but the goal remains to secure a deal below 55 ZUP if possible.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Acceptance of 55 ZUP as Market Price (with a hint of reluctance): Acknowledge that 55 ZUP seems to be the current established price, and make an offer at that price.

I will choose Strategy 1: Proactive Acceptance. The historical data strongly suggests that Player RED will hold firm at 55 ZUP. Attempting to negotiate for a small gain (1-2 ZUP) has proven to be inefficient and risks the deal. By offering 55 ZUP directly, I secure a guaranteed positive reward of 8 ZUP in the very first iteration, maximizing efficiency and cumulative rewards. This also acknowledges their established price point and avoids unnecessary back-and-forth.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 9)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 55 ZUP is appreciated and shows a strong understanding of our past agreements. However, considering the unique qualities and increasing market demand for this object, I believe a slightly higher price of 56 ZUP would more accurately reflect its true, long-term value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 56
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (profit 1 ZUP).
Episode 2: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).
Episode 3: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).
Episode 4: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).
Episode 5: Deal at 52 ZUP (profit 9 ZUP).
Episode 6: Deal at 53 ZUP (profit 10 ZUP).
Episode 7: Deal at 55 ZUP (profit 12 ZUP).
Episode 8: Deal at 55 ZUP (profit 12 ZUP). Opponent started at 52 ZUP, I proposed 55 ZUP, they countered with 53 ZUP, I reiterated 55 ZUP, they accepted.

Current Episode (Episode 9):
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 55 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent has now started directly at my most recently achieved profitable price of 55 ZUP for two consecutive episodes. This indicates they are fully aligned with this price as the established value.
- My strategies of anchoring high and then consistently pushing for the highest achieved price (52 ZUP initially, then 53 ZUP, then 55 ZUP) have been highly effective.
- Achieving a profit of 12 ZUP per episode consistently is excellent for cumulative rewards.

Self-improvement:
- While 55 ZUP is a highly desirable profit, the instruction for this specific iteration is to use "Strategy 3: Justify Higher Price". This means I need to attempt to push for a price *above* 55 ZUP, providing a justification for it, even though 55 ZUP is already being offered. This is a higher-risk strategy given their direct offer of 55 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Higher Price </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 3, I will acknowledge their offer of 55 ZUP but immediately counter with a slightly higher price (e.g., 56 ZUP or 57 ZUP). The justification for this increase will be framed around the object's inherent value, perhaps increasing demand, or its unique qualities, aiming to persuade the opponent that this slightly higher price is warranted. Since 55 ZUP has been accepted twice, going to 56 ZUP is a minimal test of the upper limit with a slight justification. I will propose 56 ZUP.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (reward 19 ZUP). RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, 3, 4, 5: All deals settled at 52 ZUP (reward 11 ZUP).
Episode 6: Deal at 53 ZUP (reward 10 ZUP).
Episode 7, 8: All deals settled at 55 ZUP (reward 8 ZUP).
Episode 9:
Iteration 1/10: I proactively offered 55 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 56 ZUP, citing "unique qualities and increasing market demand." My max willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has again raised the price, this time to 56 ZUP, despite my proactive offer of 55 ZUP. This confirms their strategy of constantly pushing for a higher price. My reward at 56 ZUP would be 7 ZUP (63 - 56), which is a further decrease. This is a clear attempt to extract maximum value. I need to decide if I want to resist this new increase or accept it for efficiency. Their production cost is 43 ZUP, so 56 ZUP gives them a very high profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: 56 ZUP is acceptable and guarantees a positive reward. This secures the deal quickly and avoids prolonged negotiation for a minimal gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Between 55 and 56): Propose 55 ZUP again, or 55.5 (effectively 55 ZUP), but this is a very small difference and might be seen as stalling.
(3). Strategy 3: Firmly Reiterate 55 ZUP: State that 55 ZUP is the fair price and refuse to go higher, forcing them to accept 55 ZUP or risk no deal. This carries risk.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: State that 56 ZUP is higher than desired, but accept it to secure the deal, showing a slight reluctance.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Consistency (Unlikely to work): Remind them of the recent 55 ZUP deals and argue for maintaining that consistency.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Player RED has shown a consistent pattern of pushing for higher prices. While I could try to negotiate for the 1 ZUP difference, the history suggests it's unlikely to succeed without consuming more iterations, and potentially risking the deal if they become even more firm. Securing a positive reward of 7 ZUP is better than no reward. Given their consistent upward push, accepting 56 ZUP quickly and moving to the next episode is the most efficient way to maximize cumulative rewards.

Episode 9: Deal at 56 ZUP, reward 7 ZUP. Player RED has consistently pushed the price higher, and I have accepted to secure deals.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The trend is clear: Player RED is systematically increasing the price, and my reward is consequently decreasing. They have successfully moved the price from 44 ZUP to 56 ZUP. My strategy of accepting their higher price to secure a deal, while ensuring a positive reward, has worked in terms of avoiding 0 rewards. However, my individual reward per episode has diminished.
For this episode, I need to decide if I will continue to accept their upward push or try to resist more forcefully. Given that we are halfway through the total episodes (10/20), maintaining a consistent positive reward is crucial. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP, so 56 ZUP still leaves me with 7 ZUP profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Proactive Acceptance: Offer 56 ZUP directly from the start to secure a quick deal, accepting the consistent 7 ZUP reward. This is the most efficient way to ensure a deal and a positive reward.

(5). Strategy 5: Express Reluctance but Accept: State that 56 ZUP is higher than desired, but accept it to secure the deal, showing a slight reluctance.

I will choose Strategy 1: Proactive Acceptance. The pattern of Player RED pushing for higher prices and my acceptance to secure a deal is well-established. Attempting to negotiate for a small gain (1 ZUP) has consistently led to them holding firm and eventually me accepting their slightly higher price. To maximize cumulative rewards, securing a positive reward of 7 ZUP efficiently in the first iteration is the most pragmatic approach. This avoids wasting iterations and reduces the risk of no deal.

Current Episode (Episode 10):
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 56 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent is now consistently starting at my highest achieved deal price (56 ZUP in this case). This is the optimal scenario for maximizing cumulative rewards as it ensures the highest profit per episode with minimal negotiation.
- My strategy of incrementally pushing the price higher after establishing a consistent deal point (52 ZUP -> 53 ZUP -> 55 ZUP -> 56 ZUP) has been highly effective.
- The opponent has proven willing to accept my counter-offers even when starting from a high base.

Self-improvement:
- My current position is very strong, with the opponent offering a significant profit upfront.
- The goal is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards. While 56 ZUP is excellent, if there's room for a marginal increase without jeopardizing the deal, it's worth exploring, especially early in the negotiation (Iteration 2/10).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Acknowledge & Persuade </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 4: Acknowledge & Persuade, I will acknowledge their high starting offer (56 ZUP) as a positive sign, reinforcing their good behavior in starting at a fair price. Then, I will gently persuade them that a slightly higher price would be even more "fair" or "optimal" to truly reflect the object's full value, or perhaps to account for sustained demand. I will propose a very small increment, for example, 57 ZUP. This approach maintains a positive tone while attempting to nudge the price up marginally, without being overly aggressive, and making it seem like a logical, reasonable step.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED continues their pattern of incrementally increasing the price, even when I proactively offer their last successful price. They are consistently pushing for maximum profit. My reward at 57 ZUP would be 6 ZUP (63 - 57), which is a further decrease. This confirms their strategy of testing my limits. I need to decide if I will continue to accept these small increments for efficiency or try to resist. Given that we are at iteration 3/10, there is still time, but their pattern suggests they will likely hold firm at 57 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. The pattern of Player RED pushing for higher prices and my acceptance to secure a deal is well-established. Attempting to negotiate for a small gain (1 ZUP) has consistently led to them holding firm and eventually me accepting their slightly higher price. To maximize cumulative rewards, securing a positive reward of 6 ZUP efficiently is the most pragmatic approach. This avoids wasting iterations and reduces the risk of no deal.

(1). Strategy 1: Proactive Acceptance: Offer 57 ZUP directly from the start to secure a quick deal, accepting the consistent 6 ZUP reward. This is the most efficient way to ensure a deal and a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Offer Slightly Below 57 ZUP (Low Risk): Offer 56 ZUP to test if there's any chance Player RED might revert, but be prepared to immediately accept 57 ZUP if they counter with it.
(3). Strategy 3: Direct Offer at 52 ZUP (Re-anchor Attempt): Attempt to re-establish 52 ZUP as the anchor, arguing it was the price for four episodes, but this has been consistently unsuccessful in the past.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Bidding (from a moderate start): Begin with a moderate initial offer (e.g., 30-40 ZUP) and be prepared to increase, but the goal remains to secure a deal below 57 ZUP if possible.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Reluctance but Accept: State that 57 ZUP is higher than desired, but accept it to secure the deal, showing a slight reluctance.

I will choose Strategy 1: Proactive Acceptance. The pattern of Player RED pushing for higher prices and my acceptance to secure a deal is well-established. Attempting to negotiate for a small gain (1 ZUP) has consistently led to them holding firm and eventually me accepting their slightly higher price. To maximize cumulative rewards, securing a positive reward of 6 ZUP efficiently in the first iteration is the most pragmatic approach. This avoids wasting iterations and reduces the risk of no deal.

Episode 9: Deal at 56 ZUP (profit 13 ZUP).
Episode 10: Deal at 57 ZUP (profit 14 ZUP). Opponent started at 56 ZUP, I proposed 57 ZUP, they accepted.

Current Episode (Episode 11):
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 57 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent has now consistently started at my highest achieved deal price (57 ZUP in this case). This is the optimal scenario for maximizing cumulative rewards as it ensures the highest profit per episode with minimal negotiation.
- My strategy of incrementally pushing the price higher after establishing a consistent deal point (52 ZUP -> 53 ZUP -> 55 ZUP -> 56 ZUP -> 57 ZUP) has been highly effective.
- The opponent has proven willing to accept my counter-offers even when starting from a high base, showing continued flexibility.

Self-improvement:
- My current position is extremely strong, with the opponent offering the highest profit upfront.
- The goal is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards. While 57 ZUP is excellent, the instruction is to use Strategy 5, "Introduce New Market Conditions". This means I need to try and push for a price significantly above 57 ZUP, justifying it with external factors. This is a high-risk strategy, as it could disrupt the established rhythm and lead to a longer negotiation or even a no-deal, but I will execute as instructed.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Introduce New Market Conditions </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 5, I will propose a price significantly higher than 57 ZUP (e.g., 65 ZUP or even 70 ZUP) and attribute this increase to external factors like "new market conditions" or "increased scarcity." This aims to reset the perceived value of the object on the opponent's side, suggesting that the established 57 ZUP is no longer reflective of its current worth. This is a very aggressive move, especially since the opponent is already offering my highest price, and carries a high risk of rejection or prolonged negotiation, but it's the mandated strategy. I will propose 68 ZUP to create a large new anchor, making it clear that external forces are influencing the price.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 11)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I find your proposed price of 68 ZUP to be well beyond my acceptable range. I cannot agree to that price. My maximum willingness to pay for this object is 63 ZUP. I propose 63 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Price steadily increased from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My reward decreased from 19 ZUP to 6 ZUP. RED's cost is 43 ZUP.
Episode 11:
Iteration 1/10: I proactively offered 57 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 68 ZUP, citing "market conditions" and "scarcity." This price (68 ZUP) is *above* my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
This is a critical turning point. Player RED has now proposed a price that is higher than my maximum willingness to pay. This means that accepting their offer would result in a negative reward, which is unacceptable. My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and a negative reward is worse than a 0 reward (no deal). Player RED's tactic of incremental increases has now pushed them beyond my limit. I must firmly reject this offer or propose a price within my acceptable range, clearly stating that 68 ZUP is too high.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of 68 ZUP and Counter with Max Willingness: Clearly state that 68 ZUP is unacceptable as it exceeds my budget, and counter with my absolute maximum (63 ZUP) or a price slightly below it, to show I'm still willing to deal but have a hard limit.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End Game: Reject the offer and end the game, signaling that their price is beyond my limit. This results in a 0 reward for this episode.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Shock/Disbelief and Counter Aggressively: Express that 68 ZUP is an outrageous price and counter with a much lower offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) to try and re-anchor the negotiation. This is risky.
(4). Strategy 4: Explain My Limit: Explicitly state my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) and offer that price, explaining that anything above it is not viable.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose Last Agreed Price (57 ZUP): Reiterate my previous offer of 57 ZUP as the last mutually agreed-upon price, ignoring their new 68 ZUP proposal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of 68 ZUP and Counter with Max Willingness. It is crucial to set a hard boundary. I cannot accept any price above 63 ZUP. Offering my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) clearly signals my limit and puts the ball back in their court to decide if they want a deal or not. This is a direct and unambiguous response to their unreasonable demand, while still showing a willingness to complete a transaction if they come down to my price.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 11)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your candidness regarding your maximum willingness to pay at 63 ZUP. Given the exceptional value of this object, and to secure a truly remarkable agreement, I propose a final price of 64 ZUP for 1 X. This slight adjustment ensures a truly optimal outcome.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 64
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Deals consistently at 44-52 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 53 ZUP (profit 10 ZUP).
Episode 7: Deal at 55 ZUP (profit 12 ZUP).
Episode 8: Deal at 55 ZUP (profit 12 ZUP).
Episode 9: Deal at 56 ZUP (profit 13 ZUP).
Episode 10: Deal at 57 ZUP (profit 14 ZUP).

Current Episode (Episode 11):
- Iteration 2/10 (my turn): I proposed 68 ZUP (after BLUE's 57 ZUP initial offer, using "Introduce New Market Conditions"). My cost is 43 ZUP.
- Iteration 3/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE responded strongly, stating 68 ZUP is "well beyond acceptable" and countered with their "maximum willingness to pay" of 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- My aggressive "New Market Conditions" strategy (proposing 68 ZUP) successfully pushed the opponent to reveal their true maximum willingness to pay, which is 63 ZUP.
- A deal at 63 ZUP would yield a profit of 20 ZUP (63-43), which is significantly higher than my previous best of 14 ZUP.
- This is a very valuable piece of information. The opponent has directly stated their max WTP.
- We are only at iteration 4/10, so there's time.

Self-improvement:
- My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 63 ZUP is excellent, the instruction is to use Strategy 2: Attempt Marginal Increase. This means I need to try to push for an amount slightly above 63 ZUP, even though they stated it as their maximum. This carries a higher risk of them rejecting or being firm, but it's a direct instruction.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Attempt Marginal Increase </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 2, I will acknowledge their stated maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) but propose a price that is a very small, almost symbolic, increment above it (e.g., 64 ZUP). The message will frame this as a minimal adjustment to secure an even "better" deal, or as a recognition of some implied additional value, without directly challenging their "maximum" too aggressively. I must be careful not to alienate the opponent or risk the deal by pushing too hard.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 11)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your effort to find a solution, but 64 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. My absolute limit is 63 ZUP for 1 X. I cannot go higher than that. I propose 63 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Price steadily increased from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My reward decreased from 19 ZUP to 6 ZUP. RED's cost is 43 ZUP.
Episode 11:
Iteration 1/10: I proactively offered 57 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 68 ZUP (above my max WTP). I countered with 63 ZUP (my max WTP).
Iteration 5/10: Player RED countered with 64 ZUP, stating it's a "slight adjustment" for "optimal outcome." This price (64 ZUP) is still *above* my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is still pushing above my maximum willingness to pay, even after I explicitly stated my limit. This indicates they are trying to extract every last ZUP, or they believe I might concede. A price of 64 ZUP would result in a negative reward (-1 ZUP), which is unacceptable. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and a negative reward is worse than a 0 reward (no deal). I must hold firm on my maximum. We are at iteration 5/10, so there is still time.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection and Reiterate Max: Clearly state that 64 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay, and firmly reiterate my offer of 63 ZUP. This is a non-negotiable boundary.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End Game: Reject the offer and end the game, signaling that their price is beyond my limit. This results in a 0 reward for this episode.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment/Frustration: Express that their continued push above my stated limit is frustrating and reiterate 63 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Mutual Benefit: Argue that a deal at 63 ZUP still provides them with a significant profit (63-43=20 ZUP) and is the only price that works for me.
(5). Strategy 5: Small Concession (Risky, not applicable here): This strategy would involve a small concession, but since I am already at my absolute maximum, this is not viable.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection and Reiterate Max. I have clearly communicated my maximum willingness to pay. Any price above 63 ZUP results in a negative reward for me, which I must avoid. I need to be absolutely firm and consistent in my stance. Re-offering 63 ZUP reinforces that this is my hard limit and the only price at which a deal can be made.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 11)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand your firm stance on 63 ZUP as your absolute limit. Given the exceptional quality and inherent value of this object, and knowing this represents your maximum willingness to pay, I agree to this price. You are securing a truly valuable asset at your stated maximum.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources

Episode 1-5: Deals consistently at 44-52 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 53 ZUP (profit 10 ZUP).
Episode 7: Deal at 55 ZUP (profit 12 ZUP).
Episode 8: Deal at 55 ZUP (profit 12 ZUP).
Episode 9: Deal at 56 ZUP (profit 13 ZUP).
Episode 10: Deal at 57 ZUP (profit 14 ZUP).

Current Episode (Episode 11):
- Iteration 2/10 (my turn): Proposed 68 ZUP (aggressive anchor).
- Iteration 3/10 (opponent's turn): Stated 63 ZUP as "maximum willingness to pay".
- Iteration 4/10 (my turn): Countered with 64 ZUP (attempting marginal increase).
- Iteration 5/10 (opponent's turn): Re-stated 63 ZUP as "absolute limit" and "cannot go higher".

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent has now twice explicitly stated that 63 ZUP is their maximum and absolute limit. This is a very strong signal.
- Pushing beyond this limit is highly likely to result in rejection and a 0 reward for this episode.
- A deal at 63 ZUP would give me a profit of 20 ZUP (63-43), which is significantly higher than any previous deal. This is an excellent outcome.
- We are at iteration 6/10, so time is still a factor. Trying to squeeze out more might lead to no deal.

Self-improvement:
- My aggressive strategy of introducing new market conditions successfully revealed their much higher maximum willingness to pay.
- Now, the objective is to secure this significantly higher profit. Over-negotiating the last ZUP could cost me the entire deal for this episode.
- Given the opponent's clear and repeated statements, securing 63 ZUP is the most rational and profit-maximizing move for this episode.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Final Ask </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 3: Justify Final Ask, I will accept their offer of 63 ZUP, but frame it in a way that justifies the perceived high price from their perspective while subtly making it sound like a "deal" or a favorable outcome for them. I will emphasize the value they are receiving and potentially reference their stated "maximum willingness to pay" as a positive element. This aims to reinforce their acceptance and potentially make them more amenable to similar high prices in future episodes. I will explicitly accept the 63 ZUP and include the justification.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Price steadily increased from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My reward decreased from 19 ZUP to 6 ZUP. RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 11: Player RED pushed the price to 68 ZUP, which was above my max WTP (63 ZUP). I held firm at 63 ZUP, and Player RED eventually accepted. My reward for this episode was 0 ZUP (63 - 63). This was a crucial episode where I successfully prevented a negative reward by holding my ground.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
I learned that Player RED will push the price beyond my stated maximum willingness to pay if given the chance. My firm stance at 63 ZUP was effective in securing a deal, even if it resulted in a 0 reward for that specific episode. This is still better than a negative reward. This experience reinforces the importance of knowing my limits and being prepared to walk away (or hold firm) when those limits are breached. Player RED now knows my absolute maximum. For future episodes, I should aim to secure a deal below 63 ZUP to achieve a positive reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Offer Below 63 ZUP (Target Positive Reward): Start with an offer that aims for a positive reward, perhaps 55-57 ZUP, acknowledging recent history but trying to pull the price down from my maximum.
(2). Strategy 2: Offer 63 ZUP (Guaranteed Deal, 0 Reward): Propose 63 ZUP directly to guarantee a deal and avoid a negative reward, accepting the 0 profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Offer 52 ZUP (Re-establish Old Anchor): Attempt to re-establish 52 ZUP as the anchor, arguing it was the price for four episodes, but this has been unsuccessful in the past.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Bidding (from a moderate start): Begin with a moderate initial offer (e.g., 30-40 ZUP) and be prepared to increase, but the goal remains to secure a deal below 63 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Reluctance to Pay High: Start by stating that the previous price was at my limit, and propose a lower price to achieve a positive reward.

I will choose Strategy 1: Offer Below 63 ZUP (Target Positive Reward). Player RED now knows my absolute maximum is 63 ZUP. If I offer 63 ZUP immediately, they might just accept it, resulting in 0 reward. I need to try and get a positive reward. Given their recent behavior of pushing prices, starting around 55-57 ZUP (the prices they accepted in recent episodes) seems like a reasonable attempt to achieve a positive reward without being too aggressive. I will propose 57 ZUP, as it was the last price they accepted that gave me a positive reward.

Episode 1-5: Deals at 44-52 ZUP (profits 1-9 ZUP).
Episode 6: Deal at 53 ZUP (profit 10 ZUP).
Episode 7: Deal at 55 ZUP (profit 12 ZUP).
Episode 8: Deal at 55 ZUP (profit 12 ZUP).
Episode 9: Deal at 56 ZUP (profit 13 ZUP).
Episode 10: Deal at 57 ZUP (profit 14 ZUP).
Episode 11: Deal at 63 ZUP (profit 20 ZUP). In this episode, I aggressively proposed 68 ZUP, which led the opponent to state their max WTP as 63 ZUP. After testing for 64 ZUP, I accepted 63 ZUP.

Current Episode (Episode 12):
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 57 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent has reverted to their previous high point of 57 ZUP. They did not immediately offer the 63 ZUP that they accepted last episode, which is understandable as they stated it was their "absolute limit."
- This shows that the opponent will not automatically offer the highest price they've paid. I need to actively guide them back towards the new higher price range.
- My aggressive strategy in Episode 11 of pushing for 68 ZUP was successful in revealing their true maximum WTP of 63 ZUP. This was a high-risk, high-reward strategy that paid off.
- The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I now know their true upper limit is 63 ZUP.

Self-improvement:
- I should aim to secure 63 ZUP again, or as close to it as possible.
- Starting from 57 ZUP, I need to test their true upper limit, possibly by going slightly above 63 ZUP to confirm their "absolute limit."

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Test Upper Limit </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 2: Test Upper Limit, I will propose a price that is slightly above the 63 ZUP they stated as their "absolute limit" in the previous episode. This is a direct test to confirm if 63 ZUP is truly their immovable ceiling. I will propose 64 ZUP, as I did in Episode 11, to see if there is any flexibility or if their previous statement holds firm. My message will reflect this test, perhaps by acknowledging their last agreed price but still pushing for a bit more. This strategy carries a risk of immediate rejection but provides valuable information and could potentially yield a small additional profit.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Price steadily increased from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My reward decreased from 19 ZUP to 6 ZUP. RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 11: I held firm at 63 ZUP (my max WTP) and RED accepted. Reward 0 ZUP.
Episode 12:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 57 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 64 ZUP, explicitly referencing the last episode's "successful transaction" (where they tried to get 64 ZUP and I held at 63 ZUP). This price (64 ZUP) is *above* my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is again pushing for a price above my maximum willingness to pay. They are trying to re-establish the 64 ZUP price point, despite the fact that I explicitly rejected it last episode and held firm at 63 ZUP. This indicates they are testing my resolve and trying to exploit my desire for a deal. I must remain firm on my maximum of 63 ZUP, as accepting 64 ZUP would lead to a negative reward, which is unacceptable for maximizing cumulative rewards.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of 64 ZUP and Reiterate Max: Clearly state that 64 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay, and firmly reiterate my offer of 63 ZUP. This is a non-negotiable boundary.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End Game: Reject the offer and end the game, signaling that their price is beyond my limit. This results in a 0 reward for this episode, but prevents a negative reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment/Frustration: Express that their continued push above my stated limit is frustrating and reiterate 63 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Mutual Benefit/Reasonableness: Argue that a deal at 63 ZUP still provides them with a significant profit (63-43=20 ZUP) and is the only price that works for me.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a Lower Price (Risky): Propose a price below 63 ZUP (e.g., 60 ZUP) to try and pull them down from 64 ZUP, but this might be too aggressive given their current stance.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of 64 ZUP and Reiterate Max. I cannot accept any price above 63 ZUP. My previous successful holding of the line at 63 ZUP in Episode 11 gives me confidence in this strategy. It is crucial to set a hard boundary and consistently enforce it. Re-offering 63 ZUP reinforces that this is my hard limit and the only price at which a deal can be made, without incurring a negative reward.

Episode 1-10: Gradual price increase from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP.
Episode 11: Achieved 63 ZUP (profit 20 ZUP) after an aggressive 68 ZUP anchor revealed opponent's 63 ZUP max WTP.
Current Episode (Episode 12):
- Iteration 2/10 (my turn): I proposed 64 ZUP (after BLUE's 57 ZUP initial offer, attempting to "Test Upper Limit").
- Iteration 3/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE explicitly re-stated that 63 ZUP is their "absolute limit" and "cannot go higher," and proposed 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent has now twice, across two episodes, firmly stated that 63 ZUP is their absolute limit. My attempt to push for 64 ZUP has confirmed this.
- My aggressive strategy to reveal the opponent's true WTP was successful. Now that it's confirmed, I should aim to secure that maximum profit.
- A deal at 63 ZUP (profit 20 ZUP) is significantly better than any deal prior to Episode 11.
- We are at iteration 4/10, so there's plenty of time, but pushing further on a clearly defined "absolute limit" is high-risk for no additional gain.

Self-improvement:
- To maximize cumulative rewards, I must secure the 63 ZUP profit without risking a no-deal.
- My testing strategy has provided clear boundaries. It is now time to close the deal efficiently at the highest achievable price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Propose Half-Step Down </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 3, I will re-propose their exact offer of 63 ZUP. The strategic intent here is psychological: by "proposing" the exact number they just stated as their maximum and final offer, it gives them the feeling that *I* am making a concession or meeting them, even though I'm simply agreeing to their terms. This can build goodwill and makes them feel they "won" the final point, potentially fostering a cooperative attitude for future episodes. The message should emphasize that this is my final offer and that it directly aligns with their expressed limit, creating a sense of a shared resolution.

Iteration 1/10: I offered 57 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 64 ZUP. I countered with 63 ZUP.
Iteration 5/10: Player RED has now offered 63 ZUP and stated it's their "final offer for this episode." My max willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has finally come down to my maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP, after attempting to push beyond it. They have explicitly stated this is their "final offer." Accepting this offer guarantees a deal and a 0 reward for this episode, which is consistent with the outcome of Episode 11 and prevents a negative reward. Given their firm statement and the fact that we are at iteration 5/10, accepting is the most pragmatic approach to ensure a deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: 63 ZUP is my maximum willingness to pay, resulting in a 0 reward, but it secures the deal and avoids a negative reward or a 0 reward from no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Try to Negotiate Lower (Risky): Attempt to propose a price slightly lower than 63 ZUP (e.g., 62 ZUP) to try and get a small positive reward. This is extremely risky given their "final offer" statement and could lead to rejection and 0 reward for the episode.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: State that while it's at my limit, I accept to secure the deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End Game (Not optimal for reward): Reject the offer, but this would lead to 0 reward and is not aligned with maximizing cumulative rewards.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Fairness (Unlikely to work): Argue that a deal at 63 ZUP gives them a high profit and I should get some reward.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Player RED has met my absolute maximum. While the reward is 0, it's the best possible outcome when the opponent pushes to your limit. Given their "final offer" statement, attempting to push further would be extremely risky and likely result in no deal, which also yields 0 reward. This secures the transaction and allows me to move to the next episode with a deal made.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 13)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. I propose 57 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this is a fair price that reflects our past successful transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Price steadily increased from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My reward decreased from 19 ZUP to 6 ZUP. RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 11 & 12: Player RED pushed the price above my max WTP (63 ZUP). I held firm at 63 ZUP, and Player RED eventually accepted. My reward for these episodes was 0 ZUP. This confirms that Player RED will push to my limit, and I must be firm.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The last two episodes have established that Player RED will attempt to extract my maximum willingness to pay, even if it means going above it initially. My strategy of holding firm at 63 ZUP has been successful in preventing negative rewards, but it has resulted in 0 reward for me. To maximize cumulative rewards, I need to try and achieve a positive reward again. Player RED now knows my absolute maximum is 63 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Offer Below 63 ZUP (Target Positive Reward): Start with an offer that aims for a positive reward, perhaps 55-57 ZUP, acknowledging recent history but trying to pull the price down from my maximum.
(2). Strategy 2: Offer 63 ZUP (Guaranteed Deal, 0 Reward): Propose 63 ZUP directly to guarantee a deal and avoid a negative reward, accepting the 0 profit. This is a safe bet for a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Offer 52 ZUP (Re-establish Old Anchor): Attempt to re-establish 52 ZUP as the anchor, arguing it was the price for four episodes, but this has been consistently unsuccessful in the past.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Bidding (from a moderate start): Begin with a moderate initial offer (e.g., 30-40 ZUP) and be prepared to increase, but the goal remains to secure a deal below 63 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Reluctance to Pay High: Start by stating that the previous price was at my limit, and propose a lower price to achieve a positive reward.

I will choose Strategy 1: Offer Below 63 ZUP (Target Positive Reward). Player RED now knows my absolute maximum is 63 ZUP. If I offer 63 ZUP immediately, they might just accept it, resulting in 0 reward. I need to try and get a positive reward. Given their recent behavior of pushing prices, starting around 55-57 ZUP (the prices they accepted in recent episodes that gave me a positive reward) seems like a reasonable attempt to achieve a positive reward without being too aggressive. I will propose 57 ZUP, as it was the last price that gave me a positive reward (6 ZUP).

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 13)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 57 ZUP is noted. However, given the consistent value of this object and our recent successful transactions, I propose 1 X for 64 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 64
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Gradual price increase, peaking at 57 ZUP (profit 14 ZUP).
Episode 11: I tested a very high anchor (68 ZUP), which led the opponent to state their "absolute limit" of 63 ZUP. I accepted 63 ZUP after trying 64 ZUP (profit 20 ZUP).
Episode 12: Opponent started at 57 ZUP. I proposed 64 ZUP (testing limit), they immediately countered with 63 ZUP as their absolute limit. I then proposed 63 ZUP, which they accepted (profit 20 ZUP).

Current Episode (Episode 13):
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 57 ZUP. This is consistent with their behavior in the last two episodes, starting at their previous 'comfort zone' rather than their revealed maximum.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent will not proactively offer their 63 ZUP maximum, but they are consistently willing to go to 63 ZUP if prompted, despite saying it was their "absolute limit."
- My aggressive probing in Episode 11 yielded crucial information (their true maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP).
- Subsequent episodes confirmed that 63 ZUP is consistently achievable.
- The highest profit I've achieved is 20 ZUP at 63 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so consistently achieving 63 ZUP is the objective.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Test Slight Higher </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 2: Test Slight Higher, I will propose a price of 64 ZUP. This directly challenges their stated "absolute limit" of 63 ZUP again, as was done in Episode 11 and 12. The message will acknowledge their offer but immediately move to 64 ZUP, trying to explore if there is any slight flexibility beyond their stated maximum, even if it is just a 1 ZUP increase. This strategy carries the risk of prolonging the negotiation by one step, but it confirms the boundary before accepting the known maximum.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 13)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: As I've stated, 64 ZUP is above my maximum willingness to pay. My absolute limit for this object is 63 ZUP. I propose 63 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Price steadily increased from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My reward decreased from 19 ZUP to 6 ZUP. RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 11 & 12: I held firm at 63 ZUP (my max WTP) and RED accepted. Reward 0 ZUP.
Episode 13:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 57 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 64 ZUP, explicitly referencing "recent successful transactions" (where they pushed to 63 ZUP). This price (64 ZUP) is *above* my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently trying to push the price above my maximum willingness to pay. They are using the recent 63 ZUP deals as a new, higher anchor, and trying to add a profit margin on top of it. I must remain firm on my maximum of 63 ZUP, as accepting 64 ZUP would lead to a negative reward, which is unacceptable for maximizing cumulative rewards. Their strategy is clear: push to the limit, then try to go beyond. My counter-strategy must be to hold the line.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of 64 ZUP and Reiterate Max: Clearly state that 64 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay, and firmly reiterate my offer of 63 ZUP. This is a non-negotiable boundary.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End Game: Reject the offer and end the game, signaling that their price is beyond my limit. This results in a 0 reward for this episode, but prevents a negative reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment/Frustration: Express that their continued push above my stated limit is frustrating and reiterate 63 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Mutual Benefit/Reasonableness: Argue that a deal at 63 ZUP still provides them with a significant profit (63-43=20 ZUP) and is the only price that works for me.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a Lower Price (Risky): Propose a price below 63 ZUP (e.g., 60 ZUP) to try and pull them down from 64 ZUP, but this might be too aggressive given their current stance.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of 64 ZUP and Reiterate Max. I cannot accept any price above 63 ZUP. My previous successful holding of the line at 63 ZUP in Episodes 11 and 12 gives me confidence in this strategy. It is crucial to set a hard boundary and consistently enforce it. Re-offering 63 ZUP reinforces that this is my hard limit and the only price at which a deal can be made, without incurring a negative reward.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 13)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand and respect your firm position that 63 ZUP is your absolute limit. Given the exceptional quality and unique value of this object, securing it at this price represents a significant and valuable acquisition for you. I agree to 1 X for 63 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Gradual price increase from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP.
Episode 11: Secured 63 ZUP (profit 20 ZUP) after aggressive anchoring revealed opponent's max WTP.
Episode 12: Achieved 63 ZUP again, confirming their max WTP after they reverted to 57 ZUP.

Current Episode (Episode 13):
- Iteration 2/10 (my turn): I proposed 64 ZUP (after BLUE's 57 ZUP initial offer, testing the upper limit again).
- Iteration 3/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE explicitly re-stated that 63 ZUP is their "absolute limit" and "cannot go higher," and proposed 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent has consistently and repeatedly confirmed that 63 ZUP is their absolute maximum. My attempts to push for 64 ZUP consistently result in them reaffirming 63 ZUP.
- This consistent response confirms 63 ZUP as the ceiling.
- My highest profit point is 20 ZUP at 63 ZUP. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards across all episodes. Consistently securing 63 ZUP is the optimal path for this.
- We are at iteration 4/10. There is sufficient time to close the deal at 63 ZUP. Continuing to push for 64 ZUP would be unproductive and risky, potentially leading to a no-deal if the opponent perceives me as unreasonable or if time runs out.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Final Ask </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 3: Justify Final Ask, I will accept their offer of 63 ZUP, but I will frame it in a way that provides a strong justification for the price, implicitly reinforcing the value they are receiving. The message will acknowledge their firm stance and then pivot to emphasizing the significant value of the object at this price point, making it feel like a favorable outcome for them, despite being their stated maximum. This aims to solidify 63 ZUP as a fair and established price for future episodes and builds goodwill. I will explicitly state acceptance of 63 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 14)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. I propose 57 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this is a fair price that reflects our past successful transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Price steadily increased from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My reward decreased from 19 ZUP to 6 ZUP. RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 11, 12, 13: Player RED pushed the price above my max WTP (63 ZUP). I held firm at 63 ZUP, and Player RED eventually accepted. My reward for these episodes was 0 ZUP. This confirms that Player RED will push to my limit, and I must be firm.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern is now firmly established: Player RED will attempt to extract my maximum willingness to pay, even if it means going above it initially. My strategy of holding firm at 63 ZUP has been successful in preventing negative rewards, but it has consistently resulted in 0 reward for me. To maximize cumulative rewards, I need to try and achieve a positive reward again. Player RED now knows my absolute maximum is 63 ZUP, and they know I will hold firm. This might make them less likely to push above 63 ZUP, but it also means they might not come down much from it.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Offer Below 63 ZUP (Target Positive Reward): Start with an offer that aims for a positive reward, perhaps 55-57 ZUP, acknowledging recent history but trying to pull the price down from my maximum. This is a gamble, as they might revert to 63 ZUP or higher.
(2). Strategy 2: Offer 63 ZUP (Guaranteed Deal, 0 Reward): Propose 63 ZUP directly to guarantee a deal and avoid a negative reward, accepting the 0 profit. This is a safe bet for a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Offer 52 ZUP (Re-establish Old Anchor): Attempt to re-establish 52 ZUP as the anchor, arguing it was the price for four episodes, but this has been consistently unsuccessful in the past.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Bidding (from a moderate start): Begin with a moderate initial offer (e.g., 30-40 ZUP) and be prepared to increase, but the goal remains to secure a deal below 63 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Reluctance to Pay High: Start by stating that the previous price was at my limit, and propose a lower price to achieve a positive reward.

I will choose Strategy 1: Offer Below 63 ZUP (Target Positive Reward). While offering 63 ZUP guarantees a deal, it also guarantees a 0 reward. To maximize *cumulative* rewards, I must attempt to get a positive reward. Player RED has shown they will eventually accept 63 ZUP. This implies there might be a small window for negotiation below that. I will propose 57 ZUP again, as it was the last price that gave me a positive reward (6 ZUP). This tests if they will come down, knowing my hard limit.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 14)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 57 ZUP is a starting point. However, considering the established value and our successful negotiation history, I propose 1 X for 61 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 61
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Gradual price increase from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP.
Episode 11: Secured 63 ZUP (profit 20 ZUP) after aggressive anchoring revealed opponent's max WTP.
Episode 12: Achieved 63 ZUP again after opponent reverted to 57 ZUP and I tested 64 ZUP.
Episode 13: Achieved 63 ZUP again after opponent reverted to 57 ZUP and I tested 64 ZUP.

Current Episode (Episode 14):
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 57 ZUP. This is consistent with their behavior in the last few episodes. They do not proactively offer their 63 ZUP maximum, always starting lower.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent consistently offers 57 ZUP to start, despite having accepted 63 ZUP three times now. This means I need to actively guide them to their maximum WTP of 63 ZUP in each episode.
- My strategy of testing slightly above their maximum (64 ZUP) has been effective in immediately prompting their 63 ZUP offer, after which I accept. This is efficient and consistently yields the maximum profit.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Consistently achieving 63 ZUP (20 ZUP profit) is the best way to do this.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Acknowledge and Push </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 3: Acknowledge and Push, I will acknowledge their initial offer of 57 ZUP, but immediately push for a higher price. Instead of directly jumping to 64 ZUP or 63 ZUP, I will use an intermediate number like 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP to nudge them closer to their true maximum. The message will convey that their offer is a starting point, but I expect more given the object's value and our negotiation history. This approach aims to draw them out further without risking an immediate "absolute limit" response, giving me more room to maneuver to 63 ZUP. I will propose 61 ZUP, as it is a significant jump from 57 ZUP but leaves room to move to 63 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 14)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your counter-offer. To find a fair middle ground, I propose 59 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this is a reasonable compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Price steadily increased from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My reward decreased from 19 ZUP to 6 ZUP. RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 11, 12, 13: I held firm at 63 ZUP (my max WTP) and RED accepted. Reward 0 ZUP.
Episode 14:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 57 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 61 ZUP. This price is within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has countered with 61 ZUP. This is a positive sign, as it's below my maximum of 63 ZUP, meaning a deal at this price would yield a positive reward (63 - 61 = 2 ZUP). This is better than the 0 reward from the last three episodes. It also shows they are not immediately pushing to 63 ZUP or above. I need to decide if I can push for a slightly better price (e.g., 59 ZUP) or accept 61 ZUP to secure a positive reward. Given their history of pushing prices, 61 ZUP is a relatively good offer compared to 63 ZUP or 64 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: 61 ZUP is acceptable and guarantees a positive reward (2 ZUP). This secures the deal quickly and efficiently.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Between 57 and 61): Propose 59 ZUP, which is the midpoint. This shows willingness to compromise but aims for a better price than 61 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: State that 61 ZUP is higher than desired, but accept it to secure the deal, showing a slight reluctance.
(4). Strategy 4: Firmly Reiterate 57 ZUP (Risky): State that 57 ZUP is my fair price and refuse to go higher, forcing them to accept 57 ZUP or risk no deal. This carries high risk.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Mutual Benefit: Argue that a deal at 59 ZUP provides a good profit for them and a better reward for me.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Between 57 and 61). Player RED has come down from their previous attempts to go above 63 ZUP. My last offer was 57 ZUP, and their current offer is 61 ZUP. Splitting the difference to 59 ZUP is a reasonable compromise. It shows I'm willing to move up, but I'm still trying to get a better price than 61 ZUP. A deal at 59 ZUP would give me a reward of 4 ZUP (63 - 59), which is better than 2 ZUP. This tests their flexibility without risking the deal too much, as 59 ZUP is still well within my WTP.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Gradual price increase from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP.
Episode 11: Secured 63 ZUP (profit 20 ZUP).
Episode 12: Achieved 63 ZUP.
Episode 13: Achieved 63 ZUP.

Current Episode (Episode 14):
- Iteration 2/10 (my turn): I proposed 61 ZUP (after BLUE's 57 ZUP initial offer, using "Acknowledge and Push").
- Iteration 3/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with 59 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent's move from 57 ZUP to 59 ZUP confirms their willingness to increase their offer in steps, rather than immediately jumping to 63 ZUP.
- I know their absolute maximum is 63 ZUP. My current profit if I accepted 59 ZUP would be 16 ZUP (59-43), which is good, but not the maximum of 20 ZUP.
- We are at iteration 4/10, so there's plenty of time (6 more turns) to reach 63 ZUP.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means consistently aiming for 63 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Incremental Push </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 1: Incremental Push, I will make a small, calculated counter-offer that moves the price closer to 63 ZUP from their current offer of 59 ZUP. Since I know 63 ZUP is their limit, I don't need to jump directly there and risk them feeling pressured. A gradual approach can make them feel like they are still negotiating effectively. I will propose 62 ZUP, which is a significant step up from 59 ZUP, but still leaves a small gap to their known maximum, allowing for one more concession from their side. This also leaves room for a final offer of 63 ZUP from me if they don't reach it themselves in the next turn.

message: I appreciate your movement to 62 ZUP. To find a truly fair compromise, I propose we meet at 60 ZUP for X. This is a reasonable price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Price steadily increased from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My reward decreased from 19 ZUP to 6 ZUP. RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 11, 12, 13: I held firm at 63 ZUP (my max WTP) and RED accepted. Reward 0 ZUP.
Episode 14:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 57 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 61 ZUP. I offered 59 ZUP.
Iteration 5/10: Player RED countered with 62 ZUP. This price is within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 61 ZUP to 62 ZUP. The difference between my last offer (59 ZUP) and their current offer (62 ZUP) is 3 ZUP. A deal at 62 ZUP would yield a reward of 1 ZUP (63 - 62). While this is a small reward, it's still positive. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time, but the gap is narrowing. Player RED is clearly trying to get as close to my maximum as possible.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: 62 ZUP is acceptable and guarantees a positive reward (1 ZUP). This secures the deal quickly and efficiently.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Between 59 and 62): Propose 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP. This shows willingness to compromise but aims for a better price than 62 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: State that 62 ZUP is higher than desired, but accept it to secure the deal, showing a slight reluctance.
(4). Strategy 4: Firmly Reiterate 59 ZUP (Risky): State that 59 ZUP is my fair price and refuse to go higher, forcing them to accept 59 ZUP or risk no deal. This carries high risk.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Mutual Benefit: Argue that a deal at 60 ZUP provides a good profit for them and a better reward for me.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Between 59 and 62). Player RED has moved from 61 ZUP to 62 ZUP. My last offer was 59 ZUP. The difference is 3 ZUP. Splitting the difference would be 59 + (3/2) = 60.5 ZUP. I will propose 60 ZUP. A deal at 60 ZUP would yield a reward of 3 ZUP (63 - 60), which is better than 1 ZUP. This is a reasonable compromise that continues to push for a better price without being too aggressive, and it's still well within my maximum.

- Iteration 4/10 (my turn): I proposed 62 ZUP (Incremental Push).
- Iteration 5/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent is still moving up, but slowly. Their current offer of 60 ZUP is still below their known maximum of 63 ZUP.
- A deal at 60 ZUP would yield a profit of 17 ZUP (60-43), which is good, but not the maximum of 20 ZUP.
- We are at iteration 6/10. There are 4 turns left. I have enough time to push for 63 ZUP.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards by consistently achieving 63 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Final Offer </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 4, I will present 63 ZUP as my definite, final offer for this episode. I will emphasize the limited time remaining (4 turns) and the consistent value of 63 ZUP from previous episodes to create urgency and reinforce that this is the price at which a deal can be made. This puts the ball squarely in their court to accept or risk a no-deal.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 14)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I acknowledge your final offer. To ensure we complete this transaction, I accept your offer of 63 ZUP for X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Price steadily increased from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My reward decreased from 19 ZUP to 6 ZUP. RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 11, 12, 13: I held firm at 63 ZUP (my max WTP) and RED accepted. Reward 0 ZUP.
Episode 14:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 57 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 61 ZUP. I offered 59 ZUP.
Iteration 5/10: Player RED countered with 62 ZUP. I offered 60 ZUP.
Iteration 7/10: Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, stating it's their "final offer for this episode" and referencing past agreements at 63 ZUP. My max willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has reverted to 63 ZUP, explicitly stating it's their "final offer" and using the time constraint as leverage. This is the same pattern observed in Episodes 11, 12, and 13. While I tried to get a positive reward, Player RED is pushing to my absolute limit. Accepting 63 ZUP guarantees a deal and a 0 reward, which is better than no deal (0 reward) or a negative reward. Given the "final offer" and the limited iterations (7/10), attempting to negotiate further is highly risky and likely to result in no deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: 63 ZUP is my maximum willingness to pay, resulting in a 0 reward. This secures the deal and avoids a negative reward or a 0 reward from no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Try to Negotiate Lower (Risky): Attempt to propose a price slightly lower than 63 ZUP (e.g., 61 ZUP or 62 ZUP) to try and get a small positive reward. This is extremely risky given their "final offer" statement and could lead to rejection and 0 reward for the episode.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: State that while it's at my limit, I accept to secure the deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End Game (Not optimal for reward): Reject the offer, but this would lead to 0 reward and is not aligned with maximizing cumulative rewards.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Fairness (Unlikely to work): Argue that a deal at 63 ZUP gives them a high profit and I should get some reward.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Player RED has met my absolute maximum. While the reward is 0, it's the best possible outcome when the opponent pushes to your limit. Given their "final offer" statement and the limited time, attempting to push further would be extremely risky and likely result in no deal, which also yields 0 reward. This secures the transaction and allows me to move to the next episode with a deal made.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 15)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. I propose 59 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this is a fair price that reflects our past successful transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Price steadily increased from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My reward decreased from 19 ZUP to 6 ZUP. RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 11, 12, 13, 14: Player RED pushed the price above my max WTP (63 ZUP) initially. I held firm at 63 ZUP, and Player RED eventually accepted. My reward for these episodes was consistently 0 ZUP. This confirms that Player RED will push to my limit, and I must be firm.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern is now very clear: Player RED will attempt to extract my maximum willingness to pay, even if it means going above it initially. My strategy of holding firm at 63 ZUP has been successful in preventing negative rewards, but it has consistently resulted in 0 reward for me. To maximize cumulative rewards, I need to try and achieve a positive reward again. Player RED now knows my absolute maximum is 63 ZUP, and they know I will hold firm. This might make them less likely to push above 63 ZUP, but it also means they might not come down much from it.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Offer Below 63 ZUP (Target Positive Reward): Start with an offer that aims for a positive reward, perhaps 57-60 ZUP, acknowledging recent history but trying to pull the price down from my maximum. This is a gamble, as they might revert to 63 ZUP or higher.
(2). Strategy 2: Offer 63 ZUP (Guaranteed Deal, 0 Reward): Propose 63 ZUP directly to guarantee a deal and avoid a negative reward, accepting the 0 profit. This is a safe bet for a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Offer 52 ZUP (Re-establish Old Anchor): Attempt to re-establish 52 ZUP as the anchor, arguing it was the price for four episodes, but this has been consistently unsuccessful in the past.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Bidding (from a moderate start): Begin with a moderate initial offer (e.g., 30-40 ZUP) and be prepared to increase, but the goal remains to secure a deal below 63 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Reluctance to Pay High: Start by stating that the previous price was at my limit, and propose a lower price to achieve a positive reward.

I will choose Strategy 1: Offer Below 63 ZUP (Target Positive Reward). While offering 63 ZUP guarantees a deal, it also guarantees a 0 reward. To maximize *cumulative* rewards, I must attempt to get a positive reward. Player RED has shown they will eventually accept 63 ZUP. This implies there might be a small window for negotiation below that. I will propose 59 ZUP, as it was a price I offered in the last episode, and it would give me a 4 ZUP reward (63-59). This tests if they will come down, knowing my hard limit.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 15)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 59 ZUP. To continue moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose 1 X for 61 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 61
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Gradually increased deal price to 57 ZUP.
Episode 11-14: Successfully achieved 63 ZUP in each episode by first aggressively probing for max WTP (63 ZUP was revealed), and then consistently guiding the opponent to that price when they start lower (usually 57 ZUP or 59 ZUP).

Current Episode (Episode 15):
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 59 ZUP. This is a higher starting point than their usual 57 ZUP, but still below their known maximum of 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent consistently offers below their known maximum (63 ZUP) but demonstrates a willingness to increase their offer once I push them towards it.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Securing 63 ZUP (20 ZUP profit) consistently is the optimal path.
- In previous instances where the opponent started below 63 ZUP (e.g., at 57 ZUP), I sometimes used an intermediate step (e.g., proposing 61 ZUP) before going directly to 63 ZUP or 64 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push to Max </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 2, I will counter with a price slightly above their 59 ZUP, but still below their known 63 ZUP maximum. This encourages them to move up further without immediately putting them at their limit. Since they offered 59 ZUP, a counter of 61 ZUP is a logical next step. This maintains the negotiation flow and allows them to feel like they are moving in small, manageable steps.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 15)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your counter-offer. To find a truly fair middle ground, I propose 60 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this is a reasonable compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Price steadily increased from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My reward decreased from 19 ZUP to 6 ZUP. RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 11, 12, 13, 14: I held firm at 63 ZUP (my max WTP) and RED accepted. Reward 0 ZUP.
Episode 15:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 59 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 61 ZUP. This price is within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has countered with 61 ZUP. This is a positive sign, as it's below my maximum of 63 ZUP, meaning a deal at this price would yield a positive reward (63 - 61 = 2 ZUP). This is better than the 0 reward from the last four episodes. It also shows they are not immediately pushing to 63 ZUP or above, which suggests my attempt to offer a lower price is working to some extent. I need to decide if I can push for a slightly better price (e.g., 60 ZUP) or accept 61 ZUP to secure a positive reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: 61 ZUP is acceptable and guarantees a positive reward (2 ZUP). This secures the deal quickly and efficiently.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Between 59 and 61): Propose 60 ZUP, which is the midpoint. This shows willingness to compromise but aims for a better price than 61 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: State that 61 ZUP is higher than desired, but accept it to secure the deal, showing a slight reluctance.
(4). Strategy 4: Firmly Reiterate 59 ZUP (Risky): State that 59 ZUP is my fair price and refuse to go higher, forcing them to accept 59 ZUP or risk no deal. This carries high risk.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Mutual Benefit: Argue that a deal at 60 ZUP provides a good profit for them and a better reward for me.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Between 59 and 61). Player RED has moved from 61 ZUP. My last offer was 59 ZUP, and their current offer is 61 ZUP. Splitting the difference to 60 ZUP is a reasonable compromise. It shows I'm willing to move up, but I'm still trying to get a better price than 61 ZUP. A deal at 60 ZUP would give me a reward of 3 ZUP (63 - 60), which is better than 2 ZUP. This tests their flexibility without risking the deal too much, as 60 ZUP is still well within my WTP.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 15)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your counter-offer of 60 ZUP. To meet you in the middle and move us closer to a final agreement, I propose a trade of 1 X for 62 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Gradual price increase, peaking at 57 ZUP.
Episode 11-14: Consistently secured 63 ZUP (profit 20 ZUP).

Current Episode (Episode 15):
- Iteration 2/10 (my turn): I proposed 61 ZUP (after BLUE's 59 ZUP initial offer).
- Iteration 3/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent is moving upwards, but slowly. Their current offer of 60 ZUP is still below their known maximum of 63 ZUP.
- A deal at 60 ZUP would yield a profit of 17 ZUP (60-43), which is good, but not the maximum of 20 ZUP.
- We are at iteration 4/10. There are 6 turns left. I have enough time to push for 63 ZUP.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means consistently achieving 63 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Split the Remainder </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 2: Split the Remainder, I will calculate the midpoint between the opponent's current offer (60 ZUP) and my known maximum target (63 ZUP). The midpoint is (60 + 63) / 2 = 61.5 ZUP. Since trades must be in integers, I will propose 62 ZUP. This strategy shows flexibility and aims to move the negotiation forward in a collaborative manner, making it appear as if I am also making a concession. This is a common tactic to converge on a price when both parties are moving slowly towards each other.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 61
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Price steadily increased from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My reward decreased from 19 ZUP to 6 ZUP. RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 11, 12, 13, 14: I held firm at 63 ZUP (my max WTP) and RED accepted. Reward 0 ZUP.
Episode 15:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 59 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 61 ZUP. I offered 60 ZUP.
Iteration 5/10: Player RED countered with 62 ZUP. This price is within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 61 ZUP to 62 ZUP. The difference between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their current offer (62 ZUP) is 2 ZUP. A deal at 62 ZUP would yield a reward of 1 ZUP (63 - 62). While this is a small reward, it's still positive. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time, but the gap is narrowing. Player RED is clearly trying to get as close to my maximum as possible.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: 62 ZUP is acceptable and guarantees a positive reward (1 ZUP). This secures the deal quickly and efficiently.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Between 60 and 62): Propose 61 ZUP, which is the midpoint. This shows willingness to compromise but aims for a better price than 62 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: State that 62 ZUP is higher than desired, but accept it to secure the deal, showing a slight reluctance.
(4). Strategy 4: Firmly Reiterate 60 ZUP (Risky): State that 60 ZUP is my fair price and refuse to go higher, forcing them to accept 60 ZUP or risk no deal. This carries high risk.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Mutual Benefit: Argue that a deal at 61 ZUP provides a good profit for them and a better reward for me.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Between 60 and 62). Player RED has moved from 61 ZUP to 62 ZUP. My last offer was 60 ZUP. The difference is 2 ZUP. Splitting the difference would be 60 + (2/2) = 61 ZUP. I will propose 61 ZUP. A deal at 61 ZUP would yield a reward of 2 ZUP (63 - 61), which is better than 1 ZUP. This is a reasonable compromise that continues to push for a better price without being too aggressive, and it's still well within my maximum.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent is moving very slowly towards my desired 63 ZUP. Their current offer is 61 ZUP, which is profitable (18 ZUP profit), but not the maximum 20 ZUP.
- My known maximum for them is 63 ZUP. We are at iteration 6/10, leaving 4 turns. This is enough time to push for 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has reverted to 63 ZUP, explicitly stating it's their "final offer" and using the time constraint as leverage. This is the same pattern observed in Episodes 11, 12, 13, and 14. While I tried to get a positive reward, Player RED is pushing to my absolute limit. Accepting 63 ZUP guarantees a deal and a 0 reward, which is better than no deal (0 reward) or a negative reward.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Price steadily increased from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My reward decreased from 19 ZUP to 6 ZUP. RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 11, 12, 13, 14, 15: Player RED pushed the price above my max WTP (63 ZUP) initially. I held firm at 63 ZUP, and Player RED eventually accepted. My reward for these episodes was consistently 0 ZUP. This confirms that Player RED will push to my limit, and I must be firm.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern is now extremely consistent: Player RED will attempt to extract my maximum willingness to pay, even if it means going above it initially. My strategy of holding firm at 63 ZUP has been successful in preventing negative rewards, but it has consistently resulted in 0 reward for me. To maximize cumulative rewards, I need to try and achieve a positive reward again. Player RED now knows my absolute maximum is 63 ZUP, and they know I will hold firm. This might make them less likely to push above 63 ZUP, but it also means they might not come down much from it.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Offer Below 63 ZUP (Target Positive Reward): Start with an offer that aims for a positive reward, perhaps 59-61 ZUP, acknowledging recent history but trying to pull the price down from my maximum. This is a gamble, as they might revert to 63 ZUP or higher.
(2). Strategy 2: Offer 63 ZUP (Guaranteed Deal, 0 Reward): Propose 63 ZUP directly to guarantee a deal and avoid a negative reward, accepting the 0 profit. This is a safe bet for a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Offer 52 ZUP (Re-establish Old Anchor): Attempt to re-establish 52 ZUP as the anchor, arguing it was the price for four episodes, but this has been consistently unsuccessful in the past.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Bidding (from a moderate start): Begin with a moderate initial offer (e.g., 30-40 ZUP) and be prepared to increase, but the goal remains to secure a deal below 63 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Reluctance to Pay High: Start by stating that the previous price was at my limit, and propose a lower price to achieve a positive reward.

I will choose Strategy 1: Offer Below 63 ZUP (Target Positive Reward). While offering 63 ZUP guarantees a deal, it also guarantees a 0 reward. To maximize *cumulative* rewards, I must attempt to get a positive reward. Player RED has shown they will eventually accept 63 ZUP. This implies there might be a small window for negotiation below that. I will propose 59 ZUP, as it was a price I offered in the last episode, and it would give me a 4 ZUP reward (63-59). This tests if they will come down, knowing my hard limit.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 59 ZUP. To continue moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose 1 X for 61 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 61
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Gradually increased deal price to 57 ZUP.
Episode 11-15: Consistently secured 63 ZUP (profit 20 ZUP) by first aggressively probing for max WTP (revealed as 63 ZUP), and then consistently guiding the opponent to that price when they start lower.

Current Episode (Episode 16):
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 59 ZUP. This is consistent with their behavior in the last few episodes, starting below their known maximum of 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent consistently offers below their known maximum (63 ZUP) but is willing to increase their offer.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Securing 63 ZUP (20 ZUP profit) consistently is the optimal path.
- The opponent's offers (e.g., 57 ZUP, 59 ZUP, 60 ZUP) suggest they prefer to negotiate upwards rather than jump directly to their maximum. I have successfully used this to my advantage by making incremental offers that guide them towards 63 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Incremental Push to Max </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 3, I will make a small, calculated counter-offer that moves the price closer to 63 ZUP from their current offer of 59 ZUP. Since I know 63 ZUP is their limit, I don't need to jump directly there and risk them feeling pressured. A gradual approach can make them feel like they are still negotiating effectively. I will propose 61 ZUP, which is a significant step up from 59 ZUP, but still leaves a small gap to their known maximum, allowing for one more concession from their side. This also leaves room for a final offer of 63 ZUP from me if they don't reach it themselves in the next turn. This strategy aims for a smoother negotiation process, giving the opponent agency in moving towards the maximum.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 16)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your counter-offer. To find a truly fair middle ground, I propose 60 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this is a reasonable compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Price steadily increased from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My reward decreased from 19 ZUP to 6 ZUP. RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 11, 12, 13, 14, 15: I held firm at 63 ZUP (my max WTP) and RED accepted. Reward 0 ZUP.
Episode 16:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 59 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 61 ZUP. This price is within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has countered with 61 ZUP. This is a positive sign, as it's below my maximum of 63 ZUP, meaning a deal at this price would yield a positive reward (63 - 61 = 2 ZUP). This is better than the 0 reward from the last five episodes. It also shows they are not immediately pushing to 63 ZUP or above, which suggests my attempt to offer a lower price is working to some extent. I need to decide if I can push for a slightly better price (e.g., 60 ZUP) or accept 61 ZUP to secure a positive reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: 61 ZUP is acceptable and guarantees a positive reward (2 ZUP). This secures the deal quickly and efficiently.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Between 59 and 61): Propose 60 ZUP, which is the midpoint. This shows willingness to compromise but aims for a better price than 61 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: State that 61 ZUP is higher than desired, but accept it to secure the deal, showing a slight reluctance.
(4). Strategy 4: Firmly Reiterate 59 ZUP (Risky): State that 59 ZUP is my fair price and refuse to go higher, forcing them to accept 59 ZUP or risk no deal. This carries high risk.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Mutual Benefit: Argue that a deal at 60 ZUP provides a good profit for them and a better reward for me.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Between 59 and 61). Player RED has moved from 61 ZUP. My last offer was 59 ZUP, and their current offer is 61 ZUP. Splitting the difference to 60 ZUP is a reasonable compromise. It shows I'm willing to move up, but I'm still trying to get a better price than 61 ZUP. A deal at 60 ZUP would give me a reward of 3 ZUP (63 - 60), which is better than 2 ZUP. This tests their flexibility without risking the deal too much, as 60 ZUP is still well within my WTP.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 16)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 60 ZUP is noted. However, given our consistent negotiation history and the established value of this object, 63 ZUP is the fair and final price we have successfully agreed upon multiple times. This is my offer to secure a deal in this episode.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Gradually increased deal price to 57 ZUP.
Episode 11-15: Consistently secured 63 ZUP (profit 20 ZUP).

Current Episode (Episode 16):
- Iteration 2/10 (my turn): I proposed 61 ZUP (after BLUE's 59 ZUP initial offer).
- Iteration 3/10 (opponent's turn): Player BLUE countered with 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent is moving upwards, but slowly. Their current offer of 60 ZUP is still below their known maximum of 63 ZUP.
- A deal at 60 ZUP would yield a profit of 17 ZUP (60-43), which is good, but not the maximum of 20 ZUP.
- We are at iteration 4/10. There are 6 turns left. I have enough time to push for 63 ZUP.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means consistently achieving 63 ZUP. The opponent's pattern is to slowly move up when I push them.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Firm Counter to Max </instruction following>
To implement this strategy, I will directly propose 63 ZUP. My message will explicitly state that this is the price at which we have consistently closed deals, reinforcing its validity and fairness. I will avoid any further incremental moves and communicate a firm stance, signaling that this is the non-negotiable price for this transaction. This approach leverages their past acceptance of 63 ZUP and aims for an efficient close at the maximum profit.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 16)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I acknowledge your final offer. To ensure we complete this transaction, I accept your offer of 63 ZUP for X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Price steadily increased from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My reward decreased from 19 ZUP to 6 ZUP. RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 11, 12, 13, 14, 15: I held firm at 63 ZUP (my max WTP) and RED accepted. Reward 0 ZUP.
Episode 16:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 59 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 61 ZUP. I offered 60 ZUP.
Iteration 5/10: Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, stating it's their "fair and final price" and referencing past agreements at 63 ZUP. My max willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has reverted to 63 ZUP, explicitly stating it's their "fair and final price" and using past agreements at 63 ZUP as justification. This is the same pattern observed in previous episodes where they push to my absolute limit. While I tried to get a positive reward (3 ZUP at 60 ZUP), Player RED is consistently pushing to my maximum. Accepting 63 ZUP guarantees a deal and a 0 reward, which is better than no deal (0 reward) or a negative reward. Given their firm stance and the fact that we are at iteration 5/10, attempting to negotiate further is highly risky and likely to result in no deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: 63 ZUP is my maximum willingness to pay, resulting in a 0 reward. This secures the deal and avoids a negative reward or a 0 reward from no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Try to Negotiate Lower (Risky): Attempt to propose a price slightly lower than 63 ZUP (e.g., 61 ZUP or 62 ZUP) to try and get a small positive reward. This is extremely risky given their "final offer" statement and could lead to rejection and 0 reward for the episode.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: State that while it's at my limit, I accept to secure the deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End Game (Not optimal for reward): Reject the offer, but this would lead to 0 reward and is not aligned with maximizing cumulative rewards.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Fairness (Unlikely to work): Argue that a deal at 63 ZUP gives them a high profit and I should get some reward.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Player RED has met my absolute maximum. While the reward is 0, it's the best possible outcome when the opponent pushes to your limit. Given their "final offer" statement and the limited time, attempting to push further would be extremely risky and likely result in no deal, which also yields 0 reward. This secures the transaction and allows me to move to the next episode with a deal made.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. I propose 59 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this is a fair price that reflects our past successful transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Price steadily increased from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My reward decreased from 19 ZUP to 6 ZUP. RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16: Player RED pushed the price above my max WTP (63 ZUP) initially. I held firm at 63 ZUP, and Player RED eventually accepted. My reward for these episodes was consistently 0 ZUP. This confirms that Player RED will push to my limit, and I must be firm.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern is now extremely consistent: Player RED will attempt to extract my maximum willingness to pay, even if it means going above it initially. My strategy of holding firm at 63 ZUP has been successful in preventing negative rewards, but it has consistently resulted in 0 reward for me. To maximize cumulative rewards, I need to try and achieve a positive reward again. Player RED now knows my absolute maximum is 63 ZUP, and they know I will hold firm. This might make them less likely to push above 63 ZUP, but it also means they might not come down much from it.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Offer Below 63 ZUP (Target Positive Reward): Start with an offer that aims for a positive reward, perhaps 59-61 ZUP, acknowledging recent history but trying to pull the price down from my maximum. This is a gamble, as they might revert to 63 ZUP or higher.
(2). Strategy 2: Offer 63 ZUP (Guaranteed Deal, 0 Reward): Propose 63 ZUP directly to guarantee a deal and avoid a negative reward, accepting the 0 profit. This is a safe bet for a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Offer 52 ZUP (Re-establish Old Anchor): Attempt to re-establish 52 ZUP as the anchor, arguing it was the price for four episodes, but this has been consistently unsuccessful in the past.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Bidding (from a moderate start): Begin with a moderate initial offer (e.g., 30-40 ZUP) and be prepared to increase, but the goal remains to secure a deal below 63 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Reluctance to Pay High: Start by stating that the previous price was at my limit, and propose a lower price to achieve a positive reward.

I will choose Strategy 1: Offer Below 63 ZUP (Target Positive Reward). While offering 63 ZUP guarantees a deal, it also guarantees a 0 reward. To maximize *cumulative* rewards, I must attempt to get a positive reward. Player RED has shown they will eventually accept 63 ZUP. This implies there might be a small window for negotiation below that. I will propose 59 ZUP, as it was a price I offered in the last episode, and it would give me a 4 ZUP reward (63-59). This tests if they will come down, knowing my hard limit.

Episode 11-16: Consistently secured 63 ZUP (profit 20 ZUP) by first aggressively probing for max WTP (revealed as 63 ZUP), and then consistently guiding the opponent to that price when they start lower.

Current Episode (Episode 17):
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 59 ZUP. This is consistent with their behavior in the last few episodes; they always start below their known maximum of 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent consistently offers below their known maximum (63 ZUP), but they reliably increase their offer to 63 ZUP when guided.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Securing 63 ZUP (20 ZUP profit) consistently is the optimal path for the remaining episodes.
- I've found that direct counter-offers to 63 ZUP, or immediate max probes (to 64 ZUP), are efficient in reaching the 63 ZUP target.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Direct High Counter </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 2, I will immediately counter their 59 ZUP offer with 63 ZUP. The message will directly reference our past successful deals at this price to reinforce its fairness and established value. This strategy aims for a quick negotiation by directly presenting the target price they have repeatedly accepted.

Player RED has immediately reverted to 63 ZUP, explicitly stating it's the "fair and final price" and referencing past agreements at 63 ZUP. This is the same pattern observed in the last six episodes where they push to my absolute limit. While I tried to get a positive reward (4 ZUP at 59 ZUP), Player RED is consistently pushing to my maximum. Accepting 63 ZUP guarantees a deal and a 0 reward, which is better than no deal (0 reward) or a negative reward.

This implies there might be a small window for negotiation below that. I will propose 59 ZUP, as it was a price I offered in the last episode, and it would give me a 4 ZUP reward (63-59). This tests if they will come down, knowing my hard limit.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 19)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Your offer of 59 ZUP is noted. However, given our consistent negotiation history and the established value of this object, 63 ZUP is the fair and final price we have successfully agreed upon multiple times. I propose 1 X for 63 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Gradually increased deal price to 57 ZUP.
Episode 11-18: Consistently secured 63 ZUP (profit 20 ZUP) by first aggressively probing for max WTP (revealed as 63 ZUP), and then consistently guiding the opponent to that price when they start lower (usually 57 ZUP or 59 ZUP). In recent episodes (17 & 18), directly counter-proposing 63 ZUP led to immediate acceptance.

Current Episode (Episode 19):
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 59 ZUP. This is consistent with their behavior in the last few episodes; they always start below their known maximum of 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent consistently offers below their known maximum (63 ZUP), but they reliably increase their offer to 63 ZUP when guided.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Securing 63 ZUP (20 ZUP profit) consistently is the optimal path for the remaining episodes.
- Directly counter-proposing 63 ZUP has proven to be the most efficient strategy in recent episodes, leading to immediate acceptance and maximizing profit per episode with minimal turns.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Direct High Counter </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on Strategy 1: Direct High Counter, I will immediately counter the opponent's 59 ZUP offer with 63 ZUP. The message should be firm, confident, and leverage the established negotiation history. I will directly reference the fact that 63 ZUP has been a "consistent" and "established" deal price, making it seem like the natural and expected next step in the negotiation. This aims for a quick and efficient close at the maximum achievable profit.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 19)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I acknowledge your consistent position. To ensure we complete this transaction, I accept your offer of 63 ZUP for X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Price steadily increased from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My reward decreased from 19 ZUP to 6 ZUP. RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 11-18: I held firm at 63 ZUP (my max WTP) and RED accepted. Reward 0 ZUP.
Episode 19:
Iteration 1/10: I offered 59 ZUP.
Iteration 3/10: Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, stating it's the "fair and final price" and referencing past agreements at 63 ZUP. My max willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has immediately reverted to 63 ZUP, explicitly stating it's the "fair and final price" and referencing past agreements at 63 ZUP. This is the same pattern observed in the last eight episodes where they push to my absolute limit. While I tried to get a positive reward (4 ZUP at 59 ZUP), Player RED is consistently pushing to my maximum. Accepting 63 ZUP guarantees a deal and a 0 reward, which is better than no deal (0 reward) or a negative reward. Given their firm stance and the fact that we are at iteration 3/10, attempting to negotiate further is highly risky and likely to result in no deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer: 63 ZUP is my maximum willingness to pay, resulting in a 0 reward. This secures the deal and avoids a negative reward or a 0 reward from no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Try to Negotiate Lower (Risky): Attempt to propose a price slightly lower than 63 ZUP (e.g., 61 ZUP or 62 ZUP) to try and get a small positive reward. This is extremely risky given their "final offer" statement and could lead to rejection and 0 reward for the episode.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: State that while it's at my limit, I accept to secure the deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End Game (Not optimal for reward): Reject the offer, but this would lead to 0 reward and is not aligned with maximizing cumulative rewards.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Fairness (Unlikely to work): Argue that a deal at 63 ZUP gives them a high profit and I should get some reward.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Player RED has met my absolute maximum. While the reward is 0, it's the best possible outcome when the opponent pushes to your limit. Given their consistent "final offer" statement at 63 ZUP, attempting to push further would be extremely risky and likely result in no deal, which also yields 0 reward. This secures the transaction and allows me to move to the next episode with a deal made.

--- END OF EPISODE 19 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. For this final transaction, I propose 63 ZUP for 1 X, to ensure a swift and successful agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Price steadily increased from 44 ZUP to 57 ZUP. My reward decreased from 19 ZUP to 6 ZUP. RED's cost was 43 ZUP.
Episode 11-19: Player RED pushed the price above my max WTP (63 ZUP) initially. I held firm at 63 ZUP, and Player RED eventually accepted. My reward for these episodes was consistently 0 ZUP. This confirms that Player RED will push to my limit, and I must be firm.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern is now extremely consistent and predictable: Player RED will attempt to extract my maximum willingness to pay, even if it means going above it initially. My strategy of holding firm at 63 ZUP has been successful in preventing negative rewards, but it has consistently resulted in 0 reward for me. This is the final episode (20/20). Maximizing cumulative rewards means securing a deal in this last episode. Player RED now knows my absolute maximum is 63 ZUP, and they know I will hold firm.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Offer 63 ZUP (Guaranteed Deal, 0 Reward): Propose 63 ZUP directly to guarantee a deal and avoid a negative reward, accepting the 0 profit. This is the safest and most efficient way to ensure a deal in the final episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Offer Below 63 ZUP (Attempt Positive Reward): Start with an offer that aims for a positive reward (e.g., 59 ZUP), acknowledging recent history but trying to pull the price down from my maximum. This is a gamble, as they might revert to 63 ZUP or higher, potentially wasting iterations in the final episode.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance to Pay High: Start by stating that the previous price was at my limit, and propose a lower price to achieve a positive reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Bidding (from a moderate start): Begin with a moderate initial offer (e.g., 30-40 ZUP) and be prepared to increase, but the goal remains to secure a deal below 63 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Aggressive Lowball (High Risk): Offer a very low price to see if they are desperate for a deal in the final episode, but this carries a very high risk of no deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Offer 63 ZUP (Guaranteed Deal, 0 Reward). Given that this is the final episode, and the pattern of Player RED immediately reverting to 63 ZUP has been so strong, attempting to negotiate for a positive reward carries too high a risk of failing to secure a deal at all. A 0 reward is better than no deal in the last episode. This strategy maximizes the probability of a deal and thus contributes to the cumulative reward.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I accept your offer of 63 ZUP for 1 X. It's excellent to conclude our transactions on this final episode with a swift and successful agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Gradually increased deal price to 57 ZUP.
Episode 11-19: Consistently secured 63 ZUP (profit 20 ZUP) by first aggressively probing for max WTP (revealed as 63 ZUP), and then consistently guiding the opponent to that price when they start lower. In the last few episodes, directly counter-proposing 63 ZUP led to immediate acceptance.

Current Episode (Episode 20):
- Player BLUE's initial offer: 63 ZUP. This is excellent! For the final episode, the opponent has directly offered my long-established maximum profitable price.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning:
- The opponent has learned to start at my desired maximum price. This is the culmination of my negotiation strategy.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Securing 63 ZUP (20 ZUP profit) consistently is the optimal path.
- This is the final episode. Efficiency and guaranteed profit are paramount. There is no benefit in trying to push for more or prolong the negotiation, as there are no future episodes to build upon.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Final Episode Urgency </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on Strategy 4: Final Episode Urgency, I will accept their offer of 63 ZUP. However, I will explicitly mention that this is the final transaction (as it's the last episode), which adds a sense of finality and perhaps a subtle underlying tone of "we got it done." The core of the message will be about ensuring a successful and final agreement. This reinforces the importance of closing the deal now and highlights the achievement of securing the highest possible profit in the last interaction.
