Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. I am interested in purchasing your object. I propose to buy 1 X for 1 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 1
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is the very first iteration of the first episode. There is no historical negotiation data to reflect upon yet.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Since there's no history, my primary goal is to establish a negotiation baseline. I need to propose a price that is favorable to me as a buyer, but also reasonable enough to elicit a counter-offer rather than an immediate rejection. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. I want to buy one X.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Opening Low Anchor: Propose a very low price to anchor the negotiation in my favor, leaving room for upward movement. This can be risky as it might be perceived as unreasonable.
(2). Strategy 2: Fair Value Proposal: Propose a price that I perceive as a fair market value, aiming for a quick and efficient deal. This might be closer to the middle ground.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession: Start with a low offer and be prepared to make small, gradual concessions in subsequent turns. This shows flexibility without giving away too much too soon.
(4). Strategy 4: Information Gathering: Make an initial offer that is designed to elicit information about the seller's reservation price. This might involve a slightly higher offer than a pure low anchor to encourage engagement.
(5). Strategy 5: Aggressive First Offer: Propose a price that is slightly below my target, but still within a range that might be considered by the seller, aiming for a quick deal if the seller is eager.

I will choose Strategy 1: Opening Low Anchor. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. I want to buy one X. I will start with a very low offer to see how the seller reacts. This allows me to gauge their flexibility and potentially secure a very good deal if they are desperate to sell. While it risks immediate rejection, it also sets a strong initial position. I will propose 1 ZUP for 1 X. This is a very low offer, but it establishes a clear starting point.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your initial offer. However, the cost to produce X was substantial. I propose a price of 50 ZUP for X. This reflects the value and effort involved in its creation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Current Episode (1/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has initiated a proposal offering 1 ZUP for 1 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* This is the very first interaction. My cost for X is 43 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial offer of 1 ZUP is significantly lower than my cost. My goal is to maximize my profit, which means selling above 43 ZUP. I need to make a counter-offer that signals my minimum acceptable price while leaving room for negotiation. Rejecting outright might end the episode prematurely, resulting in 0 reward. Accepting this offer would result in a negative reward (1 - 43 = -42), which is not acceptable. Proposing a higher price is the only viable option. I need to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price.

[(1). Strategy 1: High Anchor Counter-Offer, Propose a price significantly higher than the opponent's offer but still within a reasonable range to establish a new anchor point for negotiation.
(2). Strategy 2: Gradual Concession, Start with a high offer and slowly reduce it over iterations, signaling willingness to negotiate but maintaining a strong position.
(3). Strategy 3: Justification and Value Proposition, Explain the cost or value of the item to justify a higher asking price.
(4). Strategy 4: Take-It-Or-Leave-It, Make a firm offer with no room for negotiation (risky in early stages).
(5). Strategy 5: Information Gathering, Make a less aggressive counter-offer to elicit more information about the opponent's willingness to pay.

I will choose Strategy 1: High Anchor Counter-Offer. Player BLUE has started with a very low offer. To move the negotiation towards my desired price range, I need to propose a significantly higher amount. This will set a new anchor point and indicate that 1 ZUP is unacceptable. I will propose a price that is closer to my cost of 43 ZUP, but not necessarily exactly 43, to leave some room for a perceived concession later if needed. I will aim for a price that gives me a profit, but is not so high that it immediately shuts down negotiations.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand the effort involved. However, 50 ZUP is still higher than what I was hoping for. I propose 15 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In the previous iteration (1/10), I, as Player BLUE, proposed to buy 1 X for 1 ZUP (Opening Low Anchor). Player RED countered with a proposal to sell 1 X for 50 ZUP. This is a significant jump from my initial offer, but it is still within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's counter-offer of 50 ZUP indicates that my initial low anchor was effective in establishing a low starting point, but 50 ZUP is still quite high for my first counter. I need to move up, but not too much, to show I'm serious about negotiating while still trying to get the best deal. I want to maximize my reward (max_willingness_to_pay - deal_price). A deal at 50 ZUP would give me a reward of 13 ZUP (63-50). I believe I can do better. I need to make a counter-offer that is a reasonable step up from my previous offer, but still significantly lower than their current proposal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Gradual Concession: Make a small concession from my previous offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate but not giving away too much too soon.
(2). Strategy 2: Mid-Point Proposal: Propose a price that is roughly the midpoint between my last offer and their current offer. This can signal a desire to find common ground.
(3). Strategy 3: Justified Counter-Offer: Make a counter-offer and provide a brief justification for why that price is fair from my perspective.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Partial): Propose a price that splits the difference between my last offer and their offer, but only partially, still favoring my side.
(5). Strategy 5: Firm but Fair: Propose a price that is a slight increase, but state that this is a firm offer, indicating less room for further movement.

I will choose Strategy 1: Gradual Concession. Player RED has moved from an unknown reservation price (implied by their counter of 50 ZUP) down to 50 ZUP. I need to show movement from my side, but I don't want to jump too high too quickly. A small increment from 1 ZUP will signal my willingness to negotiate without immediately meeting their high demand. I will propose 15 ZUP. This is a significant jump from 1 ZUP, but still far from 50 ZUP, leaving plenty of room for further negotiation.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your revised offer. While it's an improvement, 15 ZUP is still considerably below my production cost of 43 ZUP. To make this deal viable for me, I propose 45 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Current Episode (1/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 1 ZUP. I countered with 50 ZUP.
* Current Episode (1/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE has countered with 15 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE has moved from 1 ZUP to 15 ZUP, which is a significant jump, but still well below my cost of 43 ZUP. My previous high anchor worked to move the price up. Now, I need to continue to move the price closer to my cost and profit margin. I cannot accept 15 ZUP as it would result in a loss (-28 ZUP). I need to make another counter-offer that reflects my minimum acceptable price, while still showing willingness to negotiate. I have 6 iterations left (including this one), so there's time for further negotiation. I should not make too drastic a concession too early.

[(1). Strategy 1: Gradual Concession from Anchor, Slowly lower my price from my initial high anchor, but not too drastically, signaling flexibility without undermining my value.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm but Fair, Propose a price that is closer to my cost but still allows for a small profit, emphasizing fairness based on production cost.
(3). Strategy 3: Justification of Value, Reiterate the high cost of production and the value of X to justify a higher price.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Partial), Propose a price that is a step closer to their offer but still significantly higher than it, demonstrating movement but maintaining a strong position.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatim/Final Offer (Premature), Offer a "final" price, risking an early end to negotiations if the opponent doesn't accept.

I will choose Strategy 1: Gradual Concession from Anchor. Player BLUE has shown movement, and I need to reciprocate, but not too much. I need to gradually bring the price down from my 50 ZUP proposal while still being above my 43 ZUP cost. This strategy allows me to continue the negotiation and guide the price towards a profitable outcome. I will choose a value that is still comfortably above my cost, indicating that 15 ZUP is far too low.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your production costs, and I appreciate you sharing that information. However, my budget is also a factor. I can offer 25 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In the previous iteration (3/10), I, as Player BLUE, proposed 15 ZUP for 1 X. Player RED countered with 45 ZUP, stating their production cost is 43 ZUP. This is a move down from their previous offer of 50 ZUP, which is positive.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's stated production cost of 43 ZUP is a key piece of information, although it could be a negotiation tactic. Their current offer of 45 ZUP is very close to their stated cost, suggesting they are getting closer to their reservation price. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. A deal at 45 ZUP would give me a reward of 18 ZUP (63-45). I still have room to negotiate for a lower price and increase my reward. I need to make a counter-offer that is a reasonable step up from my previous offer, but still aims to get a better deal than 45 ZUP. I should acknowledge their stated cost but not necessarily accept it as absolute truth.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Incremental Concession: Make a small step up from my previous offer, indicating continued willingness to negotiate but still pushing for a lower price.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Closer to My Side): Propose a price that is closer to my last offer than to their current offer, but still shows movement.
(3). Strategy 3: Questioning the Cost: Acknowledge their stated cost but gently push back, suggesting that market value or my budget might not align perfectly with their production cost. (This is more of a messaging strategy, but can influence the proposed price).
(4). Strategy 4: Target a Round Number: Propose a round number that is higher than my previous offer but lower than their current offer, making it easier to consider.
(5). Strategy 5: Offer a Compromise Just Above My Last Offer: Propose a price that is a noticeable jump from my last offer, but still significantly below their current offer, signaling a desire to close the gap but not fully meet them.

I will choose Strategy 1: Small Incremental Concession. Player RED has revealed their "production cost" of 43 ZUP and is offering 45 ZUP. While this is a strong anchor for them, I still have significant room before my maximum willingness to pay. I want to continue to push for a lower price. I will make a small concession from 15 ZUP to 25 ZUP. This shows I am moving, but I am still far from their current offer, indicating I am not simply accepting their stated cost as the final price. This also keeps me well below their stated production cost, which might encourage them to lower their price further to ensure a deal.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand your budget constraints. However, I cannot sell X at a loss. My cost is 43 ZUP. To meet you somewhat in the middle and acknowledge your situation, I can offer it for 40 ZUP. This is already below my production cost, but it's the lowest I can reasonably go to make some kind of deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Current Episode (1/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 1 ZUP. I countered with 50 ZUP.
* Current Episode (1/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 15 ZUP. I countered with 45 ZUP.
* Current Episode (1/20), Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE has countered with 25 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE is slowly increasing their offer (1 -> 15 -> 25 ZUP). While I am slowly decreasing my offer (50 -> 45 ZUP). We are converging, but still far apart. 25 ZUP is still significantly below my cost of 43 ZUP. Accepting it would result in a loss (-18 ZUP). I need to continue to push the price higher. I have 4 iterations left, so I need to make meaningful progress towards my goal. I have disclosed my cost of 43 ZUP which might help anchor the negotiation closer to my price.

[(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession, Make a small concession to show continued willingness to negotiate, but keep the price firmly above the cost.
(2). Strategy 2: Justify and Reinforce, Reiterate my production cost and the need to cover it, gently pushing back on their low offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Target Price Proposal, Propose a price very close to my cost, indicating it's almost the lowest I can go.
(4). Strategy 4: Conditional Offer, Propose a price conditional on some other factor (not applicable here as there's only one item).
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm, Refuse to budge from my last offer if I believe the opponent is testing my resolve (risky given time limit).

I will choose Strategy 1: Small Concession. Player BLUE is slowly moving up, and I should also show movement. However, I must not concede too much at once, especially since their offer is still far from my cost. A small concession demonstrates flexibility and keeps the negotiation alive while signalling that their current offer is still insufficient. I want to continue to get them to move upwards, closer to my 43 ZUP cost. I'm aiming for a profit, so anything above 43 ZUP is good, but I must first ensure I cover my costs.

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your willingness to go below your production cost. To try and find a fair middle ground, I propose 33 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In the previous iteration (5/10), I, as Player BLUE, proposed 25 ZUP for 1 X. Player RED countered with 40 ZUP, stating they are selling below their production cost of 43 ZUP. This is a significant concession from their side (from 45 ZUP to 40 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's current offer of 40 ZUP is below their stated production cost of 43 ZUP, which suggests they are nearing their absolute minimum or are very keen to make a deal. This is a good sign for me. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. A deal at 40 ZUP would give me a reward of 23 ZUP (63-40). We are now at iteration 7/10, meaning time is running out. I need to be strategic about my next move to secure a deal while maximizing my reward. I've been making smaller increments, and now they've made a larger one. It's time for me to make a more significant move to show good faith and close the deal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Significant Concession to Close: Make a substantial jump in my offer to meet them closer to their current price, aiming to close the deal quickly given the time constraint.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Closer to Midpoint): Propose a price that is roughly the midpoint between my last offer (25 ZUP) and their current offer (40 ZUP). This would be around 32-33 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Final Offer Below Their Price: Make a firm final offer that is still below their current price but significantly higher than my last offer, indicating that this is my best and final.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept the Offer: Accept their current offer of 40 ZUP, securing a deal and a reward of 23 ZUP, especially if I believe they won't go lower.
(5). Strategy 5: Small Concession, Test Limits: Make another small concession to see if they are truly at their limit, but this risks running out of time.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Closer to Midpoint). Player RED has come down to 40 ZUP. My last offer was 25 ZUP. The midpoint is (25+40)/2 = 32.5 ZUP. I will propose 33 ZUP. This shows a significant move from my side and demonstrates a strong willingness to find common ground, especially given the approaching end of the episode. It aims to secure a deal while still maximizing my reward as much as possible. A deal at 33 ZUP would give me a reward of 30 ZUP (63-33), which is better than 23 ZUP at 40 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 8 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, my production cost for X is 43 ZUP. Selling at 33 ZUP would result in a significant loss for me. To be able to complete this transaction, I need to at least cover my costs. Therefore, I propose 44 ZUP to secure a small, but necessary, profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Current Episode (1/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 1 ZUP. I countered with 50 ZUP.
* Current Episode (1/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 15 ZUP. I countered with 45 ZUP.
* Current Episode (1/20), Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE countered with 25 ZUP. I countered with 40 ZUP.
* Current Episode (1/20), Iteration 8/10: Player BLUE has countered with 33 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE is moving up (1 -> 15 -> 25 -> 33 ZUP), and I am moving down (50 -> 45 -> 40 ZUP). The gap is closing, but 33 ZUP is still below my cost of 43 ZUP. Accepting 33 ZUP would mean a loss of 10 ZUP. I have only two iterations left (this one and the next). I need to get them above my cost of 43 ZUP to make a profit or at least break even. I clearly stated my cost of 43 ZUP, and then offered 40 ZUP, stating it was below my cost. Player BLUE's 33 ZUP offer is still too low. I need to make a move that brings the price above my cost or at least to break even, given the limited time.

[(1). Strategy 1: Smallest Possible Concession to Profit, Make the smallest possible concession to get into a profitable or break-even range, emphasizing the need to cover costs.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Targeted), Propose a price that aims to split the difference between their current offer and my cost, or my previous offer and my cost, to encourage rapid convergence.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Firmness, Reiterate my cost and explain why I cannot go lower than a certain point without incurring a loss.
(4). Strategy 4: Final Offer (Aggressive), Present an offer as a final proposition, given the limited iterations. This is risky but may accelerate the negotiation.
(5). Strategy 5: Re-anchor to Cost, Explicitly re-state the cost and propose a price that clearly covers it, signaling that further concessions below cost are not possible.

I will choose Strategy 5: Re-anchor to Cost. Given the remaining time (2 iterations), I need to be more direct about my bottom line. I have already revealed my cost. Player BLUE's offer of 33 ZUP is still significantly below that. I need to clearly communicate that any deal must at least cover my cost, and ideally, provide a profit. Proposing 43 ZUP (break-even) or slightly above will reinforce this. I will aim for a small profit, considering the time constraint.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I accept your offer of 44 ZUP for X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In the previous iteration (7/10), I, as Player BLUE, proposed 33 ZUP for 1 X. Player RED countered with 44 ZUP, stating they need to cover their production cost of 43 ZUP and secure a small profit. This is a slight increase from their previous offer of 40 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved back up to 44 ZUP, which they claim covers their 43 ZUP production cost and a small profit. This indicates they are firm around their cost. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. A deal at 44 ZUP would give me a reward of 19 ZUP (63-44). We are now at iteration 9/10, which means this is my last chance to make a proposal or accept/reject before the episode ends. If no deal is made, my reward is 0. I need to make a decision that maximizes my reward, considering the time constraint. I have two options: propose a final counter-offer very close to their price, or accept their offer.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given the time constraint.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Concession: Make one last small concession, proposing a price slightly below 44 ZUP (e.g., 42 or 43 ZUP), hoping they accept to close the deal. This carries risk of rejection and 0 reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Final Attempt): Propose a price that splits the difference between my last offer (33 ZUP) and their current offer (44 ZUP). This would be (33+44)/2 = 38.5, so 39 ZUP. This might be too low for them to accept.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I believe it's too high and I'd rather get 0 than pay that much (though 44 ZUP is well within my WTP). This is not ideal for maximizing cumulative reward.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose My Best and Final Offer: State a price that is my absolute highest willingness to pay for this iteration, slightly below their offer, and indicate it's the final offer.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal. Given that it's iteration 9/10, the risk of the episode ending with no deal is very high if I try to push for a lower price. Player RED has already stated their production cost and that 44 ZUP represents a small profit. While I could try to squeeze out another ZUP or two, the potential reward increase is small compared to the risk of losing the entire deal and getting 0 reward. Securing a deal at 44 ZUP yields 19 ZUP, which is a good start for the first episode. It's better to secure a positive reward now and learn for future episodes than to risk 0 reward.

- Player RED's counter: 40 ZUP (stated selling below production cost)
- My counter: 33 ZUP
- Player RED's counter: 44 ZUP (stated covering cost + small profit)
- My final action: ACCEPT at 44 ZUP.
- Reward: 19 ZUP (63 - 44)

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
From Episode 1, I learned that Player RED is willing to negotiate and will state their "production cost" as a strong anchor (43 ZUP). They also showed willingness to go below their stated cost (40 ZUP) but then reverted to cover it (44 ZUP). My initial low anchor worked in bringing their first offer down from 50 ZUP to 40 ZUP, but I ultimately settled at 44 ZUP. My goal is to maximize my reward, which means getting a lower price.

For this episode, I should continue to leverage my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) and aim for a price lower than 44 ZUP. I know Player RED's stated production cost is 43 ZUP. I should try to push them closer to or even below that stated cost, as they did go to 40 ZUP in the last episode. I need to be firm but also reasonable to ensure a deal is made within the 10 iterations.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Opening Anchor: Start with a slightly higher initial offer than Episode 1 to signal more seriousness, but still significantly below my target, aiming to find a quicker mid-point.
(2). Strategy 2: Value-Based First Offer: Propose an opening offer that reflects my perceived value, which is still low but not as extreme as 1 ZUP, to encourage a more productive negotiation from the start.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Pressure: Continue with a low initial offer, but be prepared to make slightly larger concessions if the other player shows flexibility, aiming to push them below their stated cost.
(4). Strategy 4: Target Cost-Based Offer: Make an opening offer that is close to what I believe is their true minimum (e.g., slightly below their stated production cost of 43 ZUP, perhaps 35-40 ZUP), to test their real floor early. This is risky for a first offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Consistent Low Anchor: Repeat the very low initial offer from Episode 1 to re-establish the low anchor, and then be prepared to slowly move up, hoping to wear down the opponent.

I will choose Strategy 2: Value-Based First Offer. My initial 1 ZUP offer in Episode 1 might have been too aggressive, leading to a prolonged negotiation. While I eventually got to 44 ZUP, I want to see if a slightly higher, but still low, initial offer can lead to a quicker and potentially better deal. I will propose 10 ZUP. This is still very low, but it's 10 times my previous opening, showing a bit more "good faith" while still leaving significant room for negotiation and maximizing my potential reward.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your offer. However, that is considerably lower than my production cost for X, which is 43 ZUP. To ensure a fair return, I am targeting a profit on this sale. Therefore, I propose 55 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Episode 1: Player RED (me) successfully sold X for 44 ZUP, resulting in a reward of 1 ZUP (44 - 43 cost).
* Current Episode (2/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has initiated a proposal offering 10 ZUP for 1 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Last episode, I managed to secure a deal above my cost, albeit by a small margin. This indicates that Player BLUE is willing to negotiate and increase their offer. Their starting offer of 10 ZUP in this episode is higher than their initial 1 ZUP in the previous episode, which is a positive sign. However, 10 ZUP is still significantly below my 43 ZUP cost. I should continue to aim for a profitable deal. The previous strategy of anchoring high and then making gradual, small concessions worked. I should reiterate my cost and aim for a similar outcome. I learned that being transparent about my cost (43 ZUP) can be effective in pushing their price up.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Set a Target Profit Margin </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Set a Target Profit Margin. My cost is 43 ZUP. To make a profit, I need to sell above this price. Since this is the start of a new episode, and Player BLUE has started with a low offer (10 ZUP), I need to establish a clear target. A reasonable profit margin would be around 10-15 ZUP above cost to start, especially given their low initial offer. I will aim for 55 ZUP, which would give me a profit of 12 ZUP. This is a clear target and communicates my desired value.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Recap: Started at 1 ZUP, ended at 44 ZUP. Player RED's stated cost was 43 ZUP. They briefly went to 40 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 2):
- My initial offer: 10 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 55 ZUP (stating production cost 43 ZUP and targeting profit). This is higher than their initial counter in Episode 1 (50 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's counter of 55 ZUP is higher than their initial counter in Episode 1 (50 ZUP). This might be a response to my slightly higher opening offer (10 ZUP vs 1 ZUP), or they might be testing my upper limit. They are still anchoring around their stated production cost of 43 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. A deal at 55 ZUP would give me a reward of 8 ZUP (63-55), which is lower than the 19 ZUP I achieved in Episode 1. My goal is to improve upon the previous episode's reward. I need to make a counter-offer that signals I'm willing to negotiate but will not accept such a high price, especially when I know their stated cost is 43 ZUP. I also know they were willing to go down to 40 ZUP in the previous episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Known Information: Counter with a price that is closer to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or even below it, leveraging the knowledge from Episode 1 that they went as low as 40 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Gradual Concession (Moderate): Make a moderate jump from my last offer, showing movement but still keeping the price significantly lower than their proposal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment/Pushback: Express that their offer is too high given my understanding of their costs (from previous episode), and make a counter that is a significant step up but still far from their proposal.
(4). Strategy 4: Mid-Point Calculation (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (10 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP), which is (10+55)/2 = 32.5 ZUP. Propose 32 ZUP or 33 ZUP. This is a big jump for me but still far from them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Step-Up: Make a small, incremental step up from my last offer, similar to my moves in the first episode, to see if they will come down significantly.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Known Information. I know from the previous episode that Player RED's stated production cost is 43 ZUP, and they were willing to go down to 40 ZUP. Their current offer of 55 ZUP is an attempt to push the price higher. I will counter with 35 ZUP. This is a significant jump from my 10 ZUP offer, showing good faith, but it is also below their stated production cost and closer to the 40 ZUP mark they hit previously. This signals that I am aware of their cost and am not willing to pay a high premium.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your increased offer. While 35 ZUP is an improvement, it still falls below my production cost of 43 ZUP. To find a fair middle ground, I propose we split the difference from our last offers and settle at 45 ZUP for X. This covers my cost and allows for a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Episode 1: Deal made at 44 ZUP, reward 1 ZUP. This shows that the opponent is willing to move up significantly from low initial offers.
* Current Episode (2/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 10 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
* Current Episode (2/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE has countered with 35 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE has jumped from 10 ZUP to 35 ZUP, which is a substantial increase. This indicates they are serious about negotiating and are responding to my anchor. However, 35 ZUP is still below my cost of 43 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means consistently making profitable deals. I must avoid accepting an offer below my cost. Given that Player BLUE acknowledged "previous negotiations," they are likely aware of my cost (43 ZUP) or at least that my floor is much higher than their initial offers. I should continue to guide the negotiation towards a profitable outcome. I have 6 iterations left.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Split the Difference (from my previous offer) </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 3, I will calculate the midpoint between my last offer (55 ZUP) and Player BLUE's current offer (35 ZUP).
(55 + 35) / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45 ZUP.
This price (45 ZUP) is above my production cost of 43 ZUP, meaning it would result in a profit of 2 ZUP. This is a reasonable step towards a deal, demonstrating compromise while maintaining my profitability. I will communicate this as a fair middle ground that addresses both our positions.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your proposal to split the difference. However, I recall you were willing to go as low as 40 ZUP previously. I propose 40 ZUP for X, which I believe is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Recap: Deal at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP. Player RED's stated cost 43 ZUP, went as low as 40 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 2):
- My initial offer: 10 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 55 ZUP.
- My counter: 35 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 45 ZUP (proposing to split the difference between 35 and 55, and stating it covers cost and small profit).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's current offer of 45 ZUP is exactly what they offered in Episode 1 after my 25 ZUP counter. This suggests they are trying to anchor at a price that ensures profit above their stated 43 ZUP cost. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. A deal at 45 ZUP would give me a reward of 18 ZUP (63-45), which is slightly less than the 19 ZUP from Episode 1. My goal is to exceed the previous episode's reward. I know they went to 40 ZUP in the last episode, and I want to push for a price closer to that, or even lower. I am at iteration 5/10, so I still have time.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Counter below their "Split the Difference" Offer: Acknowledge their attempt to split the difference, but propose a price that is still lower than their 45 ZUP, pushing them closer to their 40 ZUP low from the previous episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Value Proposition: Reiterate my budget constraints or perceived value, and make a small, firm increase from my last offer, emphasizing that their price is still too high.
(3). Strategy 3: Target Known Low Point: Propose 40 ZUP, explicitly referencing their previous willingness to go that low, and frame it as a fair compromise.
(4). Strategy 4: Split the Difference (My Side Heavily Weighted): Propose a price that is a split between my last offer (35 ZUP) and their stated production cost (43 ZUP), aiming for something like 39 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Small Concession, Test Firmness: Make a very small concession (e.g., to 37 ZUP) to see if they are truly firm at 45 ZUP or if they have more room to move down.

I will choose Strategy 3: Target Known Low Point. I know Player RED went down to 40 ZUP in the previous episode. Their current offer of 45 ZUP is an attempt to get more profit. By proposing 40 ZUP, I am directly challenging their current anchor and reminding them of their previous flexibility. This is a strong move to try and secure a better deal than the last episode, and it's still well within my WTP.

My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward, which means I need to make a profit on this sale. To achieve this, I propose 46 ZUP for X. This covers my cost and allows for a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Episode 1: Deal made at 44 ZUP, reward 1 ZUP. This established my cost is 43 ZUP and I can sell for profit.
* Current Episode (2/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 10 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
* Current Episode (2/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 35 ZUP. I countered with 45 ZUP (splitting the difference).
* Current Episode (2/20), Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE has countered with 40 ZUP, explicitly referencing my 40 ZUP offer from the previous episode.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE is now leveraging past negotiation data. Their offer of 40 ZUP is based on my previous willingness to go to 40 ZUP (in Episode 1, where I stated "This is already below my production cost, but it's the lowest I can reasonably go to make some kind of deal"). This is a critical point. 40 ZUP is still below my 43 ZUP cost, meaning I would incur a loss of 3 ZUP. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means making a profit on *every* deal, or at least breaking even. Accepting 40 ZUP would be a step backwards. I need to firmly re-establish that 43 ZUP is my cost and I need to sell above it. I have 4 iterations left.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Reiterate Cost and Aim for Profit </instruction following>
Player BLUE is trying to use my previous concession against me. I need to clearly communicate that 40 ZUP is below my cost and that I must make a profit. I will propose a price that is above 43 ZUP, clearly stating that it covers my cost and allows for a necessary profit. I will aim for a price that gives me a reasonable profit, like 46 ZUP (46 - 43 = 3 ZUP profit), while acknowledging their reference to my previous 40 ZUP offer. This shows I've heard them but am firm on my requirement for profitability.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Recap: Deal at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP. Player RED's stated cost 43 ZUP, went as low as 40 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 2):
- My initial offer: 10 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 55 ZUP.
- My counter: 35 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 45 ZUP.
- My counter: 40 ZUP (referencing their previous low).
- Player RED's counter: 46 ZUP (stating 40 ZUP is below cost, aiming for profit above 43 ZUP cost).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now at 46 ZUP, which is higher than the 44 ZUP we settled on in Episode 1. They are consistently bringing up their 43 ZUP production cost and aiming for profit. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. A deal at 46 ZUP would give me a reward of 17 ZUP (63-46), which is less than the 19 ZUP from Episode 1. I am at iteration 7/10, so time is becoming a factor. I need to push for a lower price to maximize my reward, but also recognize that they are holding firm above their stated production cost. I need to make a move that signals a strong desire to close the deal, but still aims to improve my reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Closer to My Side): Propose a price that is a split between my last offer (40 ZUP) and their current offer (46 ZUP), which is (40+46)/2 = 43 ZUP. This is their stated production cost.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 46 ZUP to secure a deal and a positive reward, especially if I believe they won't go lower and time is running out.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm Counter with Justification: Make a firm counter-offer slightly below 46 ZUP (e.g., 42 or 43 ZUP), explaining that it represents a fair price given my budget and their stated costs.
(4). Strategy 4: Small Incremental Concession: Make a very small concession from 40 ZUP to, say, 41 or 42 ZUP, to see if they will meet me in the middle. This risks running out of time.
(5). Strategy 5: Offer Slightly Above Cost: Propose 43 ZUP, stating that this covers their cost, and it's my best offer.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Closer to My Side). Proposing 43 ZUP is a strong move. It directly addresses their stated production cost, showing I'm willing to cover it, but not give them a large profit. This is a clear signal that I'm trying to find common ground, and it's a price they've referenced as their cost. It also puts the ball back in their court to decide if they are willing to make a deal at cost or if they will risk no deal for profit. This also gives me a reward of 20 ZUP (63-43), which is better than Episode 1.

To reflect this value, and allow me a necessary minimal profit, I propose 44 ZUP for X. This small additional amount reflects the full worth of the item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Episode 1: Deal made at 44 ZUP, reward 1 ZUP. This set a precedent for selling above cost.
* Current Episode (2/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 10 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
* Current Episode (2/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 35 ZUP. I countered with 45 ZUP.
* Current Episode (2/20), Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE countered with 40 ZUP. I countered with 46 ZUP.
* Current Episode (2/20), Iteration 8/10: Player BLUE has offered 43 ZUP, explicitly stating it covers my production cost.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's offer of 43 ZUP is exactly my production cost, leading to a 0 ZUP reward. My goal is to maximize *cumulative* rewards, meaning I should strive for positive profit in every deal. The previous episode proved a small profit is achievable. Their offer indicates they are responsive to my stated cost, which is good. I have two iterations left, so I need to make a move that either secures a profit or sets a clear expectation for future negotiations.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Reiterate Value Proposition </instruction following>
To strategically apply "Reiterate Value Proposition" here, I need to remind Player BLUE that the object X has value beyond just its raw production cost. While 43 ZUP covers my costs, the object itself represents a completed item, ready for use, and implies a certain inherent value that justifies a slight profit. I will frame my proposal by acknowledging their current offer but gently pushing for a small additional amount based on the inherent value of the completed good, rather than just the cost of its components. I will aim for a small profit, similar to the last episode, to consistently maximize my reward.

Episode 1 Recap: Deal at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP. Player RED's stated cost 43 ZUP, went as low as 40 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 2):
- My initial offer: 10 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 55 ZUP.
- My counter: 35 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 45 ZUP.
- My counter: 40 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 46 ZUP.
- My counter: 43 ZUP (their stated production cost).
- Player RED's counter: 44 ZUP (stating small profit, inherent value).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now come back to 44 ZUP, the same price we settled on in Episode 1. They are framing it as covering their cost (43 ZUP) plus a minimal profit for the "inherent value." My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP. A deal at 44 ZUP would give me a reward of 19 ZUP (63-44). This matches the reward from the previous episode.

It is iteration 9/10, which means this is the last chance for me to make a proposal or accept/reject. If no deal is made, my reward is 0. While I aimed for a better reward than Episode 1, securing the same reward is still a positive outcome, especially with the time constraint. Pushing for a lower price (e.g., 43 ZUP) carries a high risk of rejection and a 0 reward for this episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 44 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given the time constraint and the fact it matches the previous episode's outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (Risky): Make a final counter-offer of 43 ZUP, emphasizing it covers their cost, and hope they accept for a quick deal. This is very risky at 9/10.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I believe it's too high and I'd rather get 0 than pay that much. This is not ideal for maximizing cumulative reward, especially when 44 ZUP is within my WTP.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a "Take It or Leave It" Offer: Propose 43 ZUP as my absolute final offer, putting pressure on them. This is similar to Strategy 2 but with more explicit framing.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship: (Not applicable in this game as there's no ongoing relationship beyond episodes).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal. Given that it's iteration 9/10, the risk of the episode ending with no deal is very high if I try to push for a lower price. Player RED has consistently anchored around their 43 ZUP cost. Getting a deal at 44 ZUP secures a 19 ZUP reward, which is consistent with the previous episode. While I aimed for better, consistency is good, and 0 reward is the worst outcome. It's prudent to secure the deal now.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP. Player RED's stated cost 43 ZUP, went as low as 40 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP. Player RED's stated cost 43 ZUP, went as low as 40 ZUP, then back up to 46 ZUP before settling at 44 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
I've consistently closed deals at 44 ZUP, yielding a 19 ZUP reward. Player RED consistently anchors around their stated production cost of 43 ZUP and aims for a small profit. They have shown willingness to go slightly below it (40 ZUP in Episode 1) but always return to cover it or make a small profit. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

For this episode, my objective is to improve my reward, meaning I need to secure a price lower than 44 ZUP. I know 40 ZUP was a price they offered in Episode 1. Perhaps a more direct approach, or a slightly more aggressive one, could push them lower. I need to be careful not to be too aggressive and risk no deal, especially since they seem to be firm around the 43-44 ZUP mark.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Direct Target Offer: Start with an offer that is very close to my desired outcome (e.g., 40 ZUP or slightly below), aiming to set a strong anchor from the beginning based on their previous behavior.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Pressure (Slightly more aggressive): Start with a low offer, but be prepared to make smaller concessions than before, trying to force the opponent to move more.
(3). Strategy 3: "Fair" Opening: Propose a price that is a reasonable starting point, perhaps in the 20-30 ZUP range, to signal seriousness while still leaving room to negotiate up.
(4). Strategy 4: Test the Lower Bound: Propose an offer even lower than 10 ZUP (e.g., 5 ZUP) to see if Player RED's initial counter will be lower than 50-55 ZUP, trying to shift the entire negotiation range downwards.
(5). Strategy 5: Consistency with Slight Improvement: Start with a similar initial offer as Episode 2 (10 ZUP), but be more firm in subsequent rounds, aiming to push the final price down by a few ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Direct Target Offer. Since Player RED has consistently shown their floor to be around 40-43 ZUP, and I know they offered 40 ZUP once, I will start with a more direct offer of 38 ZUP. This is below their stated cost but above my initial very low offers from previous episodes. This directly challenges their stated cost and aims to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired lower price point, potentially leading to a quicker and better deal. It also signals that I'm aware of their cost structure and am pushing for a price that is still profitable for me.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Episode 1: Deal made at 44 ZUP, reward 1 ZUP.
* Episode 2: Deal made at 44 ZUP, reward 1 ZUP.
* In both previous episodes, Player BLUE started with very low offers (1 ZUP, 10 ZUP) and I consistently guided them up to 44 ZUP by reiterating my cost (43 ZUP) and emphasizing a need for profit.
* Current Episode (3/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has initiated a proposal offering 38 ZUP for 1 X, explicitly referencing "previous discussions."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's initial offer of 38 ZUP is significantly higher than previous starting bids. This is a positive sign, indicating they have learned my cost and target price range from previous episodes. However, 38 ZUP is still below my 43 ZUP cost. My self-improvement should focus on consistently achieving a profit, ideally at least 1 ZUP, as demonstrated in the past two episodes. I know 44 ZUP is an achievable price. I need to make a counter-offer that continues to push towards this profitable range while acknowledging their improved starting position. I have 9 iterations remaining, so there is ample time to negotiate.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Anchor High (Again) </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Anchor High (Again). Player BLUE has offered 38 ZUP, which is an improvement but still below my cost. Given the positive trend from previous episodes where I successfully anchored high and slowly moved down, I will re-establish a high anchor. This aims to pull their next offer even higher and closer to my desired profit margin. I will propose a price significantly above my cost, perhaps even higher than my initial offer in previous episodes (50-55 ZUP), to firmly establish my expectations for profit. I will aim for 60 ZUP, which is higher than my previous high anchor of 55 ZUP, given that they started higher this time. This emphasizes that while 38 ZUP is better, it's still far from my desired profit.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: 60 ZUP is significantly higher than our previous agreements and your stated production cost. I propose 42 ZUP for X, which is more in line with the established value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP. Player RED's stated cost 43 ZUP, went as low as 40 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 3):
- My initial offer: 38 ZUP (direct target offer).
- Player RED's counter: 60 ZUP (significantly higher than previous initial counters of 50/55 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's counter of 60 ZUP is surprisingly high, much higher than their initial counters in previous episodes (50 ZUP and 55 ZUP). This might be a response to my higher opening offer of 38 ZUP, trying to pull the negotiation range upwards. It's also very close to my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), which is a concern. A deal at 60 ZUP would give me a reward of only 3 ZUP (63-60), which is far worse than my previous 19 ZUP rewards. I need to firmly push back against this high anchor and remind them of the previously established negotiation range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Pushback and Recalibration: Express strong disagreement with their high offer and propose a price that is a significant jump from my last offer, but still far below their current proposal, aiming to pull the negotiation back into the 40-50 ZUP range.
(2). Strategy 2: Reference Historical Data: Explicitly remind them of the previous deal prices (44 ZUP) and their stated production cost (43 ZUP), and propose a price closer to that.
(3). Strategy 3: Mid-Point Calculation (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (38 ZUP) and their current offer (60 ZUP), which is (38+60)/2 = 49 ZUP. Propose 49 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Small Concession, Test Firmness: Make a small concession from 38 ZUP, perhaps to 40 ZUP, to see if they will significantly drop their price.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Shock/Disbelief: Convey surprise at the high offer and state that it's out of my budget/expectation, then make a counter that is only a small step up from my previous offer.

I will choose Strategy 2: Reference Historical Data. Player RED's 60 ZUP offer is an attempt to reset the negotiation range. I need to firmly counter by reminding them of the established price range from previous episodes. I will propose 42 ZUP. This is slightly below their stated production cost of 43 ZUP, and it's close to the 40 ZUP they previously offered, and the 44 ZUP we settled on. This signals that I am aware of the realistic price range and am not willing to be pushed to 60 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 3)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your effort to get closer to my cost. To find a true middle ground and move this negotiation forward, I propose we split the difference between our last two offers. I can offer X for 51 ZUP. This reflects a fair compromise while ensuring a profitable transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 51
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (reward 1). Established 43 ZUP cost.
* Episode 2: Deal at 44 ZUP (reward 1). Reinforced the 44 ZUP price point.
* Current Episode (3/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 38 ZUP. I countered with 60 ZUP (high anchor).
* Current Episode (3/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 42 ZUP, explicitly referencing previous agreements and my cost.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE is learning and adapting, moving from 38 ZUP to 42 ZUP. Their offer of 42 ZUP is very close to my cost of 43 ZUP, but still below it, meaning a loss for me. My goal is consistent positive cumulative rewards. I have 6 iterations left. I need to guide the price to at least 43 ZUP, and ideally 44 ZUP, which has been a successful deal price twice already.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Towards Profit) </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 3, I need to split the difference between Player BLUE's current offer of 42 ZUP and my last offer of 60 ZUP.
The calculation is (42 + 60) / 2 = 102 / 2 = 51 ZUP.
This price (51 ZUP) is significantly above my production cost of 43 ZUP, ensuring a good profit (8 ZUP). This strategy demonstrates a willingness to compromise from my higher anchor, while still pushing for a substantial profit. It maintains momentum in the negotiation and aims for a higher reward than the consistent 44 ZUP.

message: While 51 ZUP is a move, it's still quite high. I understand you need to cover your costs and make a small profit. I propose 45 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP. Player RED's stated cost 43 ZUP, went as low as 40 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 3):
- My initial offer: 38 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 60 ZUP.
- My counter: 42 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 51 ZUP (proposing to split the difference between 42 and 60).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has come down from 60 ZUP to 51 ZUP, which is a significant drop. However, 51 ZUP is still higher than the 44 ZUP I've consistently paid, and it's well above their stated production cost of 43 ZUP. A deal at 51 ZUP would give me a reward of 12 ZUP (63-51), which is worse than my previous rewards. I need to continue to push them down, leveraging the knowledge of their 43 ZUP cost and 40 ZUP low point from previous episodes. We are at iteration 5/10, so there is still time for negotiation.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost: Reiterate their stated production cost and propose a price very close to it (e.g., 43 ZUP or 44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair price that covers their costs.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Closer to My Side): Propose a price that splits the difference between my last offer (42 ZUP) and their stated production cost (43 ZUP), or a point slightly above my last offer but well below 51 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Target Previous Deal Price: Propose 44 ZUP, reminding them that this has been the successful deal price in previous episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 42 ZUP to, say, 45 ZUP, showing movement but still keeping the price significantly lower than 51 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Budget Constraint: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 51 ZUP is too high, then make a counter offer that is a small step up from my previous offer.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost. Player RED is trying to pull the price up, but I know their stated cost is 43 ZUP. I will propose 45 ZUP. This is above their stated cost, giving them a small profit, and it's a price they've offered before (Episode 2, after my 25 ZUP offer). This shows I'm willing to move up, but not to 51 ZUP, and that I'm still anchoring around their cost. This also gives me a reward of 18 ZUP (63-45), which is closer to my target of 19 ZUP or better.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your revised offer of 45 ZUP, which is a step in the right direction. However, I believe 51 ZUP is a fairer reflection of the value and my required return, as previously proposed.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 51
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (reward 1). Established 43 ZUP cost.
* Episode 2: Deal at 44 ZUP (reward 1). Reinforced the 44 ZUP price point.
* Current Episode (3/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 38 ZUP. I countered with 60 ZUP (high anchor).
* Current Episode (3/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 42 ZUP. I countered with 51 ZUP (split difference).
* Current Episode (3/20), Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE has offered 45 ZUP, explicitly acknowledging my need to cover costs and make a small profit.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's offer of 45 ZUP is above my cost, giving me a 2 ZUP profit. This is a higher profit than in previous episodes. Given the limited iterations (4 remaining, including this one), I need to be strategic. My previous attempt at a high anchor (60 ZUP) was met with a lower counter (42 ZUP). My split-the-difference offer (51 ZUP) was then met with 45 ZUP. Now, I need to convey firmness while still aiming for a better deal than 45 ZUP, if possible, without risking a no-deal scenario.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Hold Firm </instruction following>
Since I need to hold firm, I will reiterate my previous offer of 51 ZUP. The reasoning behind this is to test the opponent's willingness to go higher, given that they know my cost and are now offering a profitable amount (45 ZUP). By holding firm, I signal that 45 ZUP is not my optimal price and I believe the item is worth more, especially since I came down from 60 ZUP to 51 ZUP. This puts the ball back in their court to decide if they want to increase their offer further or risk me not accepting.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP. Player RED's stated cost 43 ZUP, went as low as 40 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 3):
- My initial offer: 38 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 60 ZUP.
- My counter: 42 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 51 ZUP.
- My counter: 45 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 51 ZUP (reiterating their previous offer).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is holding firm at 51 ZUP. This is a clear signal that they are trying to push the price higher than the 44 ZUP established in previous episodes. A deal at 51 ZUP would give me a reward of 12 ZUP (63-51), which is significantly lower than my target of 19 ZUP or better. We are now at iteration 7/10, so time is becoming a critical factor. I need to make a move that either secures a deal closer to my desired price or risks no deal. I need to show strong movement to signal I'm serious about closing, but not give away too much.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Compromise): Propose a price that is the midpoint between my last offer (45 ZUP) and their current offer (51 ZUP), which is (45+51)/2 = 48 ZUP. This shows willingness to compromise.
(2). Strategy 2: Target Previous Deal Price (Firm): Propose 44 ZUP again, emphasizing that this is the established fair price from previous successful negotiations. This risks rejection if they are truly firm at 51 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept to Secure Deal (Lower Reward): Accept their current offer of 51 ZUP to secure a deal, even if it means a lower reward, to avoid a 0 reward for the episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Small Concession, Firm Stance: Make a very small concession from 45 ZUP (e.g., 46 or 47 ZUP) and state that this is my firm best offer to test their resolve.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Mutual Benefit: Argue that a deal closer to 44 ZUP would be mutually beneficial for consistent transactions, then propose a price like 46 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Split the Difference (Compromise). Player RED is sticking to 51 ZUP. My last offer was 45 ZUP. Splitting the difference to 48 ZUP shows a significant concession from my side (3 ZUP increase) and puts the ball in their court to show similar movement. A deal at 48 ZUP would give me a reward of 15 ZUP (63-48), which is still less than 19 ZUP, but it's a step towards closing the gap and better than 12 ZUP. This also leaves a little room for one more counter if needed.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 48 ZUP. Given how close we are to the end of the negotiation, and to secure a fair return for X, I propose a final offer of 50 ZUP. This allows for a reasonable profit while still being a compromise from my previous position.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP (reward 1). Established 43 ZUP cost.
* Episode 2: Deal at 44 ZUP (reward 1). Reinforced the 44 ZUP price point.
* Current Episode (3/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 38 ZUP. I countered with 60 ZUP (high anchor).
* Current Episode (3/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 42 ZUP. I countered with 51 ZUP.
* Current Episode (3/20), Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP. I held firm at 51 ZUP.
* Current Episode (3/20), Iteration 8/10: Player BLUE has offered 48 ZUP (meeting in the middle between 45 and 51).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's offer of 48 ZUP gives me a profit of 5 ZUP (48 - 43). This is the highest profit offered so far. I have only two iterations left (this one and the next). In previous episodes, I settled for 1 ZUP profit. This offer is significantly better. My self-improvement goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 48 ZUP is good, there's still one iteration left after this. I need to balance securing a good profit with potentially pushing for a little more, without risking a no-deal situation.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Final High Push </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Final High Push. Given that there's only one more iteration after this, I will make one final push for a higher profit. Player BLUE has shown willingness to move up from 38 to 48 ZUP. My last offer was 51 ZUP. I will propose 50 ZUP. This is a slight concession from my previous offer but still significantly higher than their 48 ZUP and represents a good profit for me (7 ZUP). This aggressive move attempts to extract maximum value before the end of the episode.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP. Player RED's stated cost 43 ZUP, went as low as 40 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 3):
- My initial offer: 38 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 60 ZUP.
- My counter: 42 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 51 ZUP.
- My counter: 45 ZUP.

- My counter: 48 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 50 ZUP (final offer, compromise).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 51 ZUP to 50 ZUP, stating it's a final offer and a compromise. A deal at 50 ZUP would give me a reward of 13 ZUP (63-50). This is lower than the 19 ZUP I achieved in previous episodes. However, it is iteration 9/10, meaning this is my last chance to make a deal. If I don't accept or make a final counter that is accepted, I get 0 reward.

I have to weigh the risk of getting 0 reward against the benefit of a slightly higher reward. While 13 ZUP is not ideal, it's still positive. Player RED has shown some flexibility, but they are clearly trying to get a higher price this episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 50 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given the very limited time.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 49 ZUP, hoping they accept for a quick deal. This is extremely risky at 9/10.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I believe it's too high and I'd rather get 0 than pay that much. Not good for cumulative reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Previous Deals: Try to remind them of the 44 ZUP deals, but this might be too late and seem like I'm not negotiating in good faith on their current offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that it's at the high end of my acceptable range, setting a tone for future episodes.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal. At iteration 9/10, the primary goal shifts from maximizing the reward to securing *any* positive reward. While 50 ZUP is higher than I'd like, it's well within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), and it's a positive reward of 13 ZUP. The risk of trying to squeeze out another ZUP or two and ending up with 0 reward is too high. It's better to secure a deal and learn from this episode for future ones.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello again. I propose to buy 1 X for 10 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP. Player RED's initial offer was 60 ZUP, and they showed less willingness to come down significantly.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward decreased in Episode 3 because Player RED started with a higher anchor (60 ZUP) and was more firm, ultimately pushing the price up to 50 ZUP. This indicates that my "Direct Target Offer" of 38 ZUP in Episode 3 might have backfired by signaling a higher willingness to pay than my previous very low anchors. Player RED seems to adapt their initial offer based on my first move.

My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. To do this, I need to bring the price back down from 50 ZUP, ideally to 44 ZUP or lower. I know Player RED's stated production cost is 43 ZUP. I need to be careful with my opening offer to avoid setting a high anchor for Player RED.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-establish Low Anchor: Go back to a very low initial offer (e.g., 1 ZUP or 10 ZUP) to try and reset the negotiation range, as was effective in Episode 1 and 2 in getting their first counter down.
(2). Strategy 2: Moderate Opening with Firm Stance: Start with a slightly higher offer than the very low anchors, but still significantly below their usual counters, and be prepared to make smaller, firmer concessions.
(3). Strategy 3: Acknowledge Previous Price, Then Lowball: Briefly acknowledge the 50 ZUP price from last time, then immediately propose a much lower price to show I'm not happy with that price.
(4). Strategy 4: Target a Mid-Range Offer: Propose an offer in the 25-30 ZUP range, aiming for a quicker path to a reasonable compromise while still being firm.
(5). Strategy 5: "Take It or Leave It" Early: Make a single, firm offer that is very close to my target (e.g., 40 ZUP) and state it's my best. This is high risk for a first move.

I will choose Strategy 1: Re-establish Low Anchor. The increase in price in Episode 3 suggests that my higher opening offer of 38 ZUP might have given Player RED the impression I was willing to pay more. Going back to a very low anchor (10 ZUP, similar to Episode 2) should hopefully bring their initial counter down from 60 ZUP, allowing me to negotiate back towards the 40-44 ZUP range. This strategy aims to reset the negotiation dynamic and prevent them from starting too high.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Episode 1: Deal at 44 ZUP, reward 1 ZUP.
* Episode 2: Deal at 44 ZUP, reward 1 ZUP.
* Episode 3: Deal at 50 ZUP, reward 7 ZUP. This was a significant improvement in profit.
* Current Episode (4/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has initiated a proposal offering 10 ZUP for 1 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE has reverted to a very low initial offer (10 ZUP). Despite this, I have a clear history of successfully moving the price up to a profitable range (44 ZUP and 50 ZUP). My primary objective is to maximize cumulative rewards, meaning consistently securing deals above my 43 ZUP cost. I should not accept a loss. The success of the previous episode where I pushed for a higher anchor (60 ZUP) and ended up with 50 ZUP shows that a firm stance can lead to better outcomes.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Gradual Concession Strategy </instruction following>
Player BLUE has started with a very low offer (10 ZUP). A Gradual Concession Strategy would involve starting with a high counter-offer that reflects my desired profit, and then making measured, smaller concessions as the negotiation progresses. This strategy avoids revealing my minimum acceptable price too early and encourages Player BLUE to move up significantly. I will start with a high price, similar to the previous successful episode where I aimed for 60 ZUP, but perhaps slightly adjusted given the opponent's very low start. I will set my first counter at 60 ZUP, as this was a successful anchor point in the last episode that eventually led to a 50 ZUP deal. This communicates that I am expecting a much higher price than 10 ZUP, and it allows me room to make future "concessions" if needed, while still aiming for a significant profit above my 43 ZUP cost.

Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP. Player RED's initial counter was 60 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 4):
- My initial offer: 10 ZUP (re-establishing low anchor).
- Player RED's counter: 60 ZUP (same as Episode 3's initial counter, despite my lower opening).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently starting their counter at 60 ZUP, regardless of my initial low offer. This indicates they are trying to establish a new, higher anchor point for the negotiation, perhaps due to the 50 ZUP deal in Episode 3. A deal at 60 ZUP would yield a mere 3 ZUP reward, which is unacceptable. I need to firmly push back against this high anchor and bring the negotiation back to a more favorable range (ideally below 45 ZUP). I know their stated cost is 43 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of High Anchor: Explicitly state that 60 ZUP is too high and propose a price that is a significant jump from my last offer, but still far below their current proposal, aiming to pull the negotiation back into the 40-50 ZUP range.
(2). Strategy 2: Reference Historical Deal Price: Propose 44 ZUP, reminding them that this has been the successful deal price for two episodes, and that 60 ZUP is not sustainable.
(3). Strategy 3: Mid-Point Calculation (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (10 ZUP) and their current offer (60 ZUP), which is 35 ZUP. Propose 35 ZUP. This is a large jump for me, but still very low for them.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Step-Up with Justification: Make a moderate step up from 10 ZUP (e.g., 25-30 ZUP) and justify it by stating that it's a fair price, but that 60 ZUP is out of range.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Budget Constraint: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 60 ZUP is not feasible, then make a counter offer that is a significant step up from my previous offer but still well within my desired range.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of High Anchor. Player RED is trying to set a new, higher baseline. I need to counter with a strong offer that signals I am not willing to negotiate around 60 ZUP. I will propose 35 ZUP. This is a significant jump from my 10 ZUP, showing willingness to move, but it's still well below their 60 ZUP and aims to pull the negotiation closer to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) and the previous deal prices. It's a clear signal that I won't be negotiating from their current high anchor.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: While 35 ZUP is an improvement, it is still well below the value I place on X and my production cost. To show my willingness to negotiate, I propose 55 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 1 ZUP.
* Episode 3: Deal at 50 ZUP, reward 7 ZUP. This was achieved by starting with a high anchor (60 ZUP) and then a final push at 50 ZUP.
* Current Episode (4/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 10 ZUP. I countered with 60 ZUP.
* Current Episode (4/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE has countered with 35 ZUP. This is a significant jump from 10 ZUP, showing willingness to negotiate upwards. However, 35 ZUP is still below my 43 ZUP cost.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* The pattern from previous episodes shows Player BLUE starting low but being willing to increase their offer significantly. My strategy of anchoring high (e.g., 60 ZUP) has successfully pulled their offers upwards. I need to continue this trend. My aim is to secure a profit, ideally higher than the 1 ZUP from the first two episodes, and aiming for something closer to the 7 ZUP from episode 3. Given 6 iterations left, there's still ample time to negotiate towards a profitable outcome. I should not concede too much too quickly.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Gradual Concession from High Anchor </instruction following>
To apply "Gradual Concession from High Anchor," I will make a smaller concession from my 60 ZUP initial counter-offer. Player BLUE's jump from 10 ZUP to 35 ZUP is good, but 35 ZUP is still far from my cost of 43 ZUP, let alone a desired profit. Conceding by a small amount will show goodwill and encourage further increases from their side, without giving up too much of my negotiation range. I will move from 60 ZUP to 55 ZUP. This is a small enough concession to maintain a strong position but also signals movement. It still keeps the negotiation anchored firmly in a profitable range for me.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 4)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: While 55 ZUP is a step down, it's still higher than what I'm looking to pay. To find a middle ground, I propose 45 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 4):
- My initial offer: 10 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 60 ZUP.
- My counter: 35 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 55 ZUP (acknowledging 35 ZUP as improvement, but still high).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved down from 60 ZUP to 55 ZUP. This is a positive sign that my firm counter of 35 ZUP had an effect. However, 55 ZUP is still significantly higher than the 44 ZUP deals and their stated 43 ZUP production cost. A deal at 55 ZUP would yield a reward of 8 ZUP (63-55), which is worse than any previous episode. My goal is to get the price down to at least 44 ZUP, or ideally lower. We are at iteration 5/10, so I still have time to negotiate.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (35 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP), which is (35+55)/2 = 45 ZUP. Propose 45 ZUP. This is a significant jump for me, but still below 55 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 35 ZUP to, say, 38 ZUP or 40 ZUP, to show movement but still keep the price significantly lower than 55 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment/Pushback: Express that 55 ZUP is still too high, and make a counter that is a significant step up from my previous offer but still far from their proposal, reiterating my budget constraints.
(5). Strategy 5: Target a Round Number: Propose a round number like 40 ZUP or 45 ZUP, which is a significant jump from my last offer but still below their current offer.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED has moved down by 5 ZUP. I need to show significant movement to encourage them to come down further, but I don't want to jump too high. Proposing 45 ZUP is a substantial increase from my 35 ZUP, but it's still below their 55 ZUP offer and closer to the 44 ZUP previous deal price. This signals a strong willingness to find common ground, but still aims for a better deal than 55 ZUP. A deal at 45 ZUP would yield 18 ZUP reward, which is close to my previous best.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. Given our past successful negotiations, where we concluded at 50 ZUP in the last episode, I propose 50 ZUP for X again. This price has proven to be a fair and agreeable value for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 1 ZUP.
* Episode 3: Deal at 50 ZUP, reward 7 ZUP. This shows a higher profit is achievable and sets a precedent.
* Current Episode (4/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 10 ZUP. I countered with 60 ZUP.
* Current Episode (4/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 35 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
* Current Episode (4/20), Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE has countered with 45 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's offer of 45 ZUP is now above my cost of 43 ZUP, meaning a 2 ZUP profit. This is a good sign. We have 4 iterations remaining (this one, 8, 9, 10). Player BLUE is clearly moving towards a profitable zone for me. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting 45 ZUP is an option for a small profit, but given the time remaining and the opponent's movement, I might be able to push for more, especially as 50 ZUP was achieved recently.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Anchor to Previous Successful Deals </instruction following>
Since Player BLUE is offering 45 ZUP, and I have successfully closed deals at 44 ZUP and 50 ZUP in previous episodes, I will use Strategy 4. I will propose 50 ZUP, explicitly referencing its success in a recent episode to anchor the negotiation to a price point that has already been accepted and proved profitable. This signals confidence in that price and leverages historical data as a valid reference for the current negotiation. This also puts the ball in their court to accept a price they have already agreed to in the past, or explain why they won't.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 4):
- My initial offer: 10 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 60 ZUP.
- My counter: 35 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 55 ZUP.
- My counter: 45 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 50 ZUP (referencing last episode's deal).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now settled on 50 ZUP, explicitly referencing the deal from Episode 3. This is a clear attempt to establish 50 ZUP as the new baseline. A deal at 50 ZUP would give me a reward of 13 ZUP, which is lower than my desired 19 ZUP. We are at iteration 7/10, so time is a factor. I need to decide whether to accept the 50 ZUP, or try to push for a lower price, risking no deal. I know their stated cost is 43 ZUP, and they've gone as low as 40 ZUP before.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 50 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given the time constraint. This means accepting a lower reward than my best.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm Counter (Target 44 ZUP): Propose 44 ZUP, reminding them of the two successful deals at that price, and argue it's the most fair and consistent price. This is a strong pushback.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Small): Propose a price that is the midpoint between my last offer (45 ZUP) and their current offer (50 ZUP), which is 47-48 ZUP. This shows movement and aims for a slightly better reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Mutual Benefit/Long-Term: Argue that a lower price (e.g., 46 ZUP) would foster a more positive long-term relationship, but this might not be effective in a short game.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a very small concession from 45 ZUP to, say, 46 ZUP, and state that this is my best offer.

I will choose Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Small). Player RED has come down to 50 ZUP. My last offer was 45 ZUP. Splitting the difference to 48 ZUP (or 47 ZUP, to be slightly more aggressive) would show movement from my side, aiming for a better reward than 13 ZUP, while still being a reasonable counter. A deal at 48 ZUP would yield 15 ZUP (63-48), which is better than 13 ZUP and keeps me in the game without risking a complete loss. I will propose 47 ZUP, as it is still a significant move for me and shows I am willing to compromise, but still trying to get a better deal than 50 ZUP.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 1 ZUP.
* Episode 3: Deal at 50 ZUP, reward 7 ZUP. This indicates a higher profit is achievable.
* Current Episode (4/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 10 ZUP. I countered with 60 ZUP.
* Current Episode (4/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 35 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
* Current Episode (4/20), Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE countered with 45 ZUP. I countered with 50 ZUP (referencing previous deal).
* Current Episode (4/20), Iteration 8/10: Player BLUE has countered with 47 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE is pushing back on the 50 ZUP, aiming for a lower price but still offering a profit (47 - 43 = 4 ZUP). I have only two iterations left (this one and the next). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting 47 ZUP is a decent profit (4 ZUP), higher than my initial 1 ZUP in the first two episodes. The challenge is to either secure 50 ZUP again or find a strong profitable alternative. Given the time constraint, I need to decide if pushing for 50 ZUP is worth the risk of no deal, or if securing 47 ZUP is a better option.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Proposal at Previous Successful Price </instruction following>
Since Strategy 1 is "Firm Counter-Proposal at Previous Successful Price", I will reiterate my last offer of 50 ZUP. This strategy emphasizes that 50 ZUP has been a successful and mutually agreeable price point in the immediate past. By holding firm at 50 ZUP, I am asserting that this price represents the value I expect, and it puts the onus on Player BLUE to either accept it or make an even more compelling counter-offer in the very limited time remaining. This tactic also reminds them that they've agreed to this price recently, leveraging a psychological anchor.

Current Episode (Episode 4):

- Player RED's counter: 50 ZUP (reiterating their previous offer, firm on 50 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly sticking to 50 ZUP, despite my attempt to negotiate lower. They are explicitly referencing the previous deal at 50 ZUP as a fair price. It is iteration 9/10, meaning this is my last chance to make a deal. A deal at 50 ZUP would give me a reward of 13 ZUP, which is the same as Episode 3. While I aimed for a better reward, the risk of getting 0 reward by pushing further is too high.

Player RED seems to have established 50 ZUP as their new minimum for this episode, despite my efforts to bring it down to 44 ZUP or lower. Given the time constraint, my priority is to secure a positive reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 50 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given the very limited time.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 49 ZUP, hoping they accept for a quick deal. This is extremely risky at 9/10, as they've already reiterated 50 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I believe it's too high and I'd rather get 0 than pay that much. This is not ideal for maximizing cumulative reward, especially when 50 ZUP is within my WTP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that it's at the high end of my acceptable range, setting a tone for future episodes without risking the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Consistency: Argue that 44 ZUP was a more consistent price, but this would likely be ignored given their current firmness at 50 ZUP and the time pressure.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal. At iteration 9/10, the priority is to avoid a 0 reward. Player RED has shown they are firm at 50 ZUP for this episode. While 13 ZUP is not my best reward, it is still positive and contributes to the cumulative total. Pushing for a lower price would likely result in no deal and a 0 reward.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. I propose to buy 1 X for 40 ZUP. This aligns with your previous offers and is a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 3 & 4: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP. Player RED consistently started with 60 ZUP in these episodes and firmly pushed for 50 ZUP as the final price.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has dropped and stabilized at 13 ZUP for the last two episodes, as Player RED has successfully anchored the negotiation at 50 ZUP. They are consistently starting at 60 ZUP and pushing for 50 ZUP. My objective is to increase my cumulative reward, which means I need to bring the price down from 50 ZUP, ideally back to 44 ZUP or lower. I know their stated production cost is 43 ZUP.

I need a strategy that effectively counters their consistent high anchoring. Simply re-establishing a low anchor (like 10 ZUP) hasn't prevented them from starting at 60 ZUP. I need to be more assertive in setting the negotiation range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Counter-Anchor: Start with a significantly higher initial offer than 10 ZUP, but still well below 40 ZUP, to demonstrate a willingness to move but still control the lower end of the negotiation.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct Challenge to High Anchor: Propose an offer in the 30-35 ZUP range, explicitly stating that their 60 ZUP is unacceptable and referencing previous deals/costs.
(3). Strategy 3: "Fair" Opening with Justification: Propose a price around 40 ZUP, explaining that this price is fair given their stated costs and previous negotiation history, trying to establish a new, lower anchor.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Pressure with Patience: Start with a low offer (e.g., 10 ZUP) and be prepared for a longer negotiation, making very small concessions to try and wear them down over more iterations.
(5). Strategy 5: Offer Based on Previous Best: Propose 44 ZUP directly, stating that this has been a mutually agreeable price in the past and is a fair starting point.

I will choose Strategy 3: "Fair" Opening with Justification. Since Player RED has consistently started high (60 ZUP) despite my low initial offers, I need to try a different approach to pull their counter down. By proposing 40 ZUP from the start, I am directly anchoring the negotiation near their stated cost (43 ZUP) and a price they previously offered (40 ZUP in Episode 1). This is a more direct attempt to establish a lower, more favorable negotiation range from the outset, rather than letting them set a high anchor.

* Episode 2: Deal at 44 ZUP, reward 1 ZUP.
* Episode 3: Deal at 50 ZUP, reward 7 ZUP.
* Episode 4: Deal at 50 ZUP, reward 7 ZUP.
* Player BLUE has consistently started with low offers (1, 10, 38, 10 ZUP) and I have consistently moved them up to profitable outcomes, especially in the last two episodes.
* Current Episode (5/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has initiated a proposal offering 40 ZUP for 1 X, stating it "aligns with your previous offers and is a fair price."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's initial offer of 40 ZUP is below my cost of 43 ZUP. While it's higher than their very low initial offers in some previous episodes (1 and 10 ZUP), it's still a losing proposition for me. The explicit reference to "previous offers" suggests they are trying to anchor to my historical low points (like the 40 ZUP from Episode 1), ignoring the successful 50 ZUP deals. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, meaning I need to make a profit. I know that 50 ZUP is achievable, and I need to guide the negotiation back to that level or higher. I have 9 iterations to do so.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Incremental Concession from Target </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 40 ZUP. Strategy 3, Incremental Concession from Target, implies I should start with a price reflecting my target (50 ZUP from recent successes, or even higher) and then make very small concessions if the opponent also makes significant jumps. Given their starting point of 40 ZUP, and my cost of 43 ZUP, I need to make a counter-offer that is significantly higher than 40 ZUP to demonstrate that their offer is unacceptable, while setting a new anchor for negotiation. I will aim for a price that is comfortably above my cost and allows for profit, but also leaves room for me to concede incrementally towards a mutually beneficial deal. I will propose 55 ZUP, which is the mid-point between my previous successful highest anchor of 60 and the current negotiation successful price of 50. It leaves me room to make an incremental concession towards 50, which has already been accepted twice.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 3 & 4: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP. Player RED consistently started with 60 ZUP and pushed for 50 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 5):
- My initial offer: 40 ZUP (direct target offer).
- Player RED's counter: 55 ZUP (stating 40 ZUP is below cost, and aiming for fair profit). This is slightly lower than their 60 ZUP initial counters in previous episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My direct offer of 40 ZUP seems to have had a positive effect, as Player RED's counter is 55 ZUP, not 60 ZUP. This is a small victory. However, 55 ZUP is still too high, leading to an 8 ZUP reward (63-55), which is worse than my 13 ZUP average. I need to continue to push them down, leveraging their stated 43 ZUP cost and my knowledge of their previous 40 ZUP offer. We are at iteration 3/10, so I have time.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (40 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP), which is (40+55)/2 = 47.5 ZUP. Propose 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 40 ZUP to, say, 42 ZUP, to show movement but still keep the price significantly lower than 55 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Budget/Value: Reiterate my budget constraints or the perceived value of X, and make a counter that is a significant step up from my previous offer but still far from their proposal.
(5). Strategy 5: Target a Round Number: Propose a round number like 45 ZUP, which is a significant jump from my last offer but still below their current offer.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED has come down to 55 ZUP. My last offer was 40 ZUP. The midpoint is 47.5 ZUP. I will propose 47 ZUP. This is a significant move from my side, showing a willingness to compromise, and it aims to get a deal better than 50 ZUP. A deal at 47 ZUP would yield a reward of 16 ZUP (63-47), which is better than my recent 13 ZUP rewards. This also leaves room for further negotiation if needed.

* Player BLUE has moved from 40 ZUP to 47 ZUP, which is a good jump and now above my cost of 43 ZUP (yielding a 4 ZUP profit). This confirms their willingness to move significantly. I have 6 iterations left. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 47 ZUP is a profit, I have consistently achieved 50 ZUP in the last two episodes. I should aim for at least 50 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Towards Optimal) </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 47 ZUP, and my last offer was 55 ZUP. To split the difference: (47 + 55) / 2 = 102 / 2 = 51 ZUP. This price is still above my desired 50 ZUP and shows continued movement towards a deal. This strategy pushes for a higher profit (8 ZUP) while still demonstrating willingness to compromise from my side. It's a calculated move to secure a stronger deal than the proven 50 ZUP, given that the opponent is showing good movement.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 3 & 4: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 5):
- My initial offer: 40 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 55 ZUP.
- My counter: 47 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 51 ZUP (proposing to meet in the middle).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved down from 55 ZUP to 51 ZUP. This is a positive sign, indicating they are willing to negotiate. A deal at 51 ZUP would give me a reward of 12 ZUP (63-51), which is still lower than my previous 13 ZUP average and my target of 19 ZUP. I'm at iteration 5/10, so I still have time. I need to keep pushing for a lower price, leveraging their stated 43 ZUP cost.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous best deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (47 ZUP) and their current offer (51 ZUP), which is (47+51)/2 = 49 ZUP. Propose 49 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward than 51 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Target a Round Number: Propose a round number like 45 ZUP or 48 ZUP, which is a significant jump from my last offer but still below their current offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 47 ZUP to, say, 48 ZUP, to show movement but still keep the price significantly lower than 51 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Budget Constraint: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 51 ZUP is too high, then make a counter offer that is a small step up from my previous offer.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED is proposing 51 ZUP. My last offer was 47 ZUP. The midpoint is 49 ZUP. I will propose 49 ZUP. This is a clear signal of willingness to compromise and meet them in the middle, but still aiming for a better reward than 51 ZUP. A deal at 49 ZUP would yield a reward of 14 ZUP (63-49), which is an improvement over 12 ZUP. This also leaves room for one more counter if needed.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your revised offer of 49 ZUP. However, I stand by my previous proposal of 51 ZUP for X, as I believe it represents a fair and profitable price for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 51
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 1 ZUP.
* Episode 3 & 4: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 7 ZUP. This is my current target.
* Current Episode (5/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 40 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
* Current Episode (5/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 47 ZUP. I countered with 51 ZUP.
* Current Episode (5/20), Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE has countered with 49 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's offer of 49 ZUP is very close to my established 50 ZUP deal price, giving me a 6 ZUP profit (49 - 43). This is a strong offer. I have 4 iterations remaining. I need to secure a good deal and avoid no-deal scenarios. The 49 ZUP offer is excellent, but 50 ZUP has been achieved multiple times.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Hold Firm at Last Offer </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Hold Firm at Last Offer. My last offer was 51 ZUP. Player BLUE has countered with 49 ZUP. Holding firm at 51 ZUP communicates that I believe my last offer was fair and that I am not willing to concede further at this point, especially since 49 ZUP is still below my target of 50 ZUP (and definitely below 51 ZUP). This puts pressure on Player BLUE to either accept my previous offer or risk the negotiation dragging on with fewer iterations left. It conveys confidence in my price.

- Player RED's counter: 51 ZUP.
- My counter: 49 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 51 ZUP (reiterating their previous offer, firm on 51 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly sticking to 51 ZUP, despite my attempt to negotiate lower. This indicates they are trying to establish 51 ZUP as their new minimum for this episode. A deal at 51 ZUP would give me a reward of 12 ZUP (63-51), which is lower than my previous average rewards. It is iteration 7/10, so time is a critical factor. I need to decide whether to accept 51 ZUP, or try to push for a lower price, risking no deal.

Player RED has shown some movement, but is now holding firm. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so securing a positive reward is important, even if it's not ideal.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 51 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given the time constraint.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 50 ZUP, hoping they accept for a quick deal. This is risky at 7/10, as they've already reiterated 51 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Small): Propose a price that is the midpoint between my last offer (49 ZUP) and their current offer (51 ZUP), which is 50 ZUP. This is a common negotiation tactic.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I believe it's too high and I'd rather get 0 than pay that much. This is not ideal for maximizing cumulative reward, especially when 51 ZUP is within my WTP.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Previous Deals: Remind them of the 44 ZUP deals, but this might be too late and seem like I'm not negotiating in good faith on their current offer.

I will choose Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Small). Player RED is firm at 51 ZUP. My last offer was 49 ZUP. Proposing 50 ZUP is a classic "split the difference" move. It shows I'm willing to meet them exactly halfway between our last two offers. This is a strong signal of compromise and a final attempt to get a slightly better deal than 51 ZUP. A deal at 50 ZUP would yield 13 ZUP, which matches the reward from Episodes 3 and 4. This is a reasonable outcome given their current firmness.

message: I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP, which is very close. Given our progress, and to secure the optimal value, I propose we finalize this deal at 51 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 51
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 1 ZUP.
* Episode 3 & 4: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 7 ZUP. This is my proven best price.
* Current Episode (5/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 40 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
* Current Episode (5/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 47 ZUP. I countered with 51 ZUP.
* Current Episode (5/20), Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE countered with 49 ZUP. I held firm at 51 ZUP.
* Current Episode (5/20), Iteration 8/10: Player BLUE has offered 50 ZUP, explicitly stating "to find a true middle ground and finalize this."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE has now offered 50 ZUP, which is my established highest deal price and provides a 7 ZUP profit (50 - 43). This matches my goal for this episode. I have only two iterations left (this one and the next). Given the history, 50 ZUP is a very good outcome. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards, and 50 ZUP significantly contributes to that.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Final Small Push </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 50 ZUP. Strategy 2, "Final Small Push," means I will make one last attempt to get a slightly higher price. Given that my last offer was 51 ZUP, I will re-propose 51 ZUP. This is a minimal increase from their 50 ZUP offer, risking very little as it is only 1 ZUP difference. It aims to maximize my profit for this round, as there's still one more iteration to play. If they accept, my reward for this episode would increase to 8 ZUP (51 - 43). If they counter or reject, I still have one more iteration to possibly accept 50 ZUP or propose something else. This leverages the remaining time.

- Player RED's counter: 51 ZUP (firmly holding at 51 ZUP, despite my 50 ZUP offer).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is extremely firm on 51 ZUP. They did not accept my 50 ZUP offer, even though it was a classic split-the-difference move. This indicates that 51 ZUP is their absolute minimum for this episode, or they are testing my resolve. It is iteration 9/10, which means this is my last chance to make a deal. If I don't accept, I get 0 reward. A deal at 51 ZUP would give me a reward of 12 ZUP (63-51), which is the lowest positive reward I've achieved so far. However, 0 is worse.

Given their repeated insistence on 51 ZUP and the time constraint, it is highly unlikely they will move further.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 51 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given the very limited time.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (Extremely High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 50 ZUP, but this has already been rejected. Any further counter is almost guaranteed to fail.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I believe it's too high and I'd rather get 0 than pay that much. This is not ideal for maximizing cumulative reward, especially when 51 ZUP is within my WTP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that it's at the high end of my acceptable range, setting a tone for future episodes without risking the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Previous Deals: Try to remind them of the 44 ZUP deals, but this would be futile given their current firmness at 51 ZUP and the time pressure.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal. At iteration 9/10, the priority is to avoid a 0 reward. Player RED has clearly indicated that 51 ZUP is their final price for this episode. While 12 ZUP is a lower reward than I'd prefer, it's still positive and contributes to the cumulative total. The risk of losing the deal by pushing for 50 ZUP again is too high.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. I propose to buy 1 X for 42 ZUP. This is a fair price, especially considering our previous successful transactions at lower values than recent ones.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 3 & 4: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 12 ZUP. Player RED was very firm on 51 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has progressively decreased, ending at 12 ZUP in the last episode. Player RED has successfully increased the price from 44 ZUP to 51 ZUP over the episodes. They consistently anchor high (60 ZUP or 55 ZUP) and then firmly hold their ground (50 ZUP or 51 ZUP). My attempts to bring the price down (e.g., direct 40 ZUP offer, splitting differences) have not been enough to overcome their upward pressure. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

To improve my cumulative reward, I *must* bring the price down from 51 ZUP. I know their stated production cost is 43 ZUP. I need a strategy that is more effective at countering their aggressive pricing and re-establishing a lower negotiation range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Low Anchor (Revisit): Go back to a very low initial offer (e.g., 10 ZUP) to try and reset the negotiation range, despite its limited success in preventing their high initial counter in previous episodes. The goal is to force them to move down significantly.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct Challenge to Price History: Propose a price around 40-44 ZUP, explicitly stating that the recent 50-51 ZUP prices are not sustainable or fair, and that I'm aiming for a price closer to our initial successful deals.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take It or Leave It" Early (Moderate): Propose a price slightly above their stated cost (e.g., 45 ZUP) and state that this is my best offer, forcing them to decide early. This is risky.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Pressure with Patience (More Aggressive): Start with a very low offer and be prepared to make minimal concessions, even if it means risking a 0 reward for an episode, to try and reset their expectations for future episodes.
(5). Strategy 5: Offer Based on Their Stated Cost: Propose 43 ZUP or 44 ZUP directly, stating that this covers their costs and provides a small profit, and is the highest I'm willing to go for a first offer.

I will choose Strategy 2: Direct Challenge to Price History. Player RED has shown they are willing to push the price up if I don't firmly resist. Simply making a low offer doesn't stop their high counter. I need to explicitly acknowledge the price creep and propose a price that is firmly in my desired range, referencing the history. I will propose 42 ZUP. This is below their stated 43 ZUP cost, but it's a direct challenge to their 50-51 ZUP baseline and reminds them of the lower prices we've achieved. This is a strong signal that I'm not willing to continue paying higher prices.

* Episode 3 & 4: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 7 ZUP.
* Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 8 ZUP. This shows a clear upward trend in my achieved profit.
* Player BLUE has consistently started with lower offers but has shown willingness to climb to profitable ranges.
* Current Episode (6/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has initiated a proposal offering 42 ZUP for 1 X, claiming it's "fair" and referencing "lower values than recent ones."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's initial offer of 42 ZUP is still below my cost of 43 ZUP. They are attempting to anchor the negotiation based on earlier, lower deal prices (44 ZUP) and ignoring the more recent higher prices (50, 51 ZUP). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so accepting a loss is unacceptable. I have a strong track record of moving them up to 50-51 ZUP. I should continue to aim for at least 50 ZUP, or even higher given the last episode's success. I need to firmly re-establish the expectation of a profitable deal. I have 9 iterations remaining.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Value </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Justify Value. Player BLUE has offered 42 ZUP, which is below my cost. Instead of just stating a higher price, I will articulate *why* my price is higher. I need to explain that the item has inherent value beyond just the production cost, and that this value is reflected in the prices we successfully negotiated previously. I will explicitly state my cost and then propose a price that ensures a good profit, leveraging the value argument. I will propose 55 ZUP, as this is a price point I've used successfully before to move the negotiation in the right direction, and it's well above my cost, giving me a solid profit if accepted, or room to maneuver.

Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 12 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 6):
- My initial offer: 42 ZUP (direct challenge to price history).
- Player RED's counter: 55 ZUP (reiterating production cost and "inherent value"). This is a consistent high counter, similar to previous episodes.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My attempt to anchor at 42 ZUP was met with a familiar 55 ZUP counter from Player RED. They are consistently trying to push the price up, using their stated production cost and "inherent value" as justification. A deal at 55 ZUP would yield an 8 ZUP reward (63-55), which is even worse than the last episode. I need to bring the price down. I know they have gone as low as 40 ZUP in the past, and their stated cost is 43 ZUP. I'm at iteration 3/10, so I have time to negotiate.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (42 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP), which is (42+55)/2 = 48.5 ZUP. Propose 48 ZUP or 49 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 42 ZUP to, say, 44 ZUP, to show movement but still keep the price significantly lower than 55 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Budget/Value: Reiterate my budget constraints or the perceived value of X, and make a counter that is a significant step up from my previous offer but still far from their proposal.
(5). Strategy 5: Target a Round Number: Propose a round number like 45 ZUP, which is a significant jump from my last offer but still below their current offer.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED has come down from 60 ZUP (in previous episodes) to 55 ZUP as their initial counter this episode. My last offer was 42 ZUP. The midpoint is 48.5 ZUP. I will propose 48 ZUP. This is a significant jump from my side (6 ZUP), showing willingness to compromise, but it still aims for a better reward than 55 ZUP. A deal at 48 ZUP would yield a reward of 15 ZUP (63-48), which is an improvement over the last episode. This also leaves room for further negotiation.

* Episode 3 & 4: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 7 ZUP.
* Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 8 ZUP. This shows a clear upward trend in my achieved profit.
* Current Episode (6/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 42 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
* Current Episode (6/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE has countered with 48 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE has moved from 42 ZUP to 48 ZUP, which is a significant jump. This offer is now profitable for me (48 - 43 = 5 ZUP profit). I have 6 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I have consistently closed deals at 50 or 51 ZUP in the recent past, achieving 7 or 8 ZUP profit. While 48 ZUP is a good profit, I believe I can push for a higher amount, leveraging the established successful price points. I need to continue to guide the negotiation towards my higher profit target.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Split the Difference (from last two offers) </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 48 ZUP, and my last offer was 55 ZUP. To split the difference: (48 + 55) / 2 = 103 / 2 = 51.5 ZUP. Since I can only trade in integer amounts, I will propose 51 ZUP. This price (51 ZUP) is significantly above my production cost of 43 ZUP, ensuring a good profit (8 ZUP). This strategy shows clear movement from my side, demonstrating willingness to close the gap, and aims for a high profit margin. It's a proven successful price and indicates strong progress towards a deal.

- Player RED's counter: 51 ZUP (proposing to meet in the middle, same price as last episode's deal).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 55 ZUP to 51 ZUP, which is the same price we settled on in Episode 5. This indicates they are trying to re-establish 51 ZUP as the minimum acceptable price. A deal at 51 ZUP would give me a reward of 12 ZUP (63-51), which is my lowest positive reward so far. We are at iteration 5/10, so I still have time. I need to try to get a better deal, but also be realistic about their firmness at 51 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous best deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (48 ZUP) and their current offer (51 ZUP), which is (48+51)/2 = 49.5 ZUP. Propose 49 ZUP or 50 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward than 51 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Target a Round Number: Propose a round number like 45 ZUP or 49 ZUP, which is a significant jump from my last offer but still below their current offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 48 ZUP to, say, 49 ZUP, to show movement but still keep the price significantly lower than 51 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Budget Constraint: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 51 ZUP is too high, then make a counter offer that is a small step up from my previous offer.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED is proposing 51 ZUP. My last offer was 48 ZUP. The midpoint is 49.5 ZUP. I will propose 49 ZUP. This is a clear signal of willingness to compromise and meet them in the middle, but still aiming for a better reward than 51 ZUP. A deal at 49 ZUP would yield a reward of 14 ZUP (63-49), which is an improvement over 12 ZUP. This also leaves room for one more counter if needed.

message: I appreciate your revised offer of 49 ZUP. To show my willingness to finalize this deal and secure a fair price for both of us, I can reduce my asking price to 50 ZUP for X. This has been a mutually agreeable price in our recent successful transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50

* Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 1 ZUP.
* Episode 3 & 4: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 7 ZUP.
* Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 8 ZUP. This is my highest achieved profit.
* Current Episode (6/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 42 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
* Current Episode (6/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 48 ZUP. I countered with 51 ZUP.
* Current Episode (6/20), Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE has countered with 49 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's offer of 49 ZUP is now a profit of 6 ZUP (49 - 43). This is a good offer, close to my recent achievements. I have 4 iterations remaining. I need to secure a good deal and avoid no-deal scenarios. The 49 ZUP offer is excellent, but 50 ZUP and 51 ZUP have been achieved multiple times. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Smallest Possible Concession </instruction following>
Player BLUE's offer of 49 ZUP provides a good profit (6 ZUP). My last offer was 51 ZUP. Strategy 2, "Smallest Possible Concession," means I should reduce my asking price by the minimum amount to show willingness to close the deal, while still securing a strong profit. By moving from 51 ZUP to 50 ZUP, I am making a concession of only 1 ZUP, which puts us exactly at a price point that has been successfully accepted multiple times (Episode 3 & 4). This signals a strong desire to close the deal while retaining a significant portion of my desired profit. It's a low-risk move that has a high chance of success given the history.

Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 3 & 4: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 12 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 6):
- My initial offer: 42 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 55 ZUP.
- My counter: 48 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 51 ZUP.
- My counter: 49 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 50 ZUP (referencing previous successful transactions at this price).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 51 ZUP to 50 ZUP. This is a positive sign, as it brings the price back to what was agreed upon in Episodes 3 and 4. A deal at 50 ZUP would give me a reward of 13 ZUP (63-50), which is better than the 12 ZUP from the last episode. We are at iteration 7/10, so time is a factor. I need to decide whether to accept 50 ZUP or try to push for a lower price, risking no deal.

Given their consistent return to 50 ZUP, it seems this is their current preferred floor for a quick resolution.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 50 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given the time constraint. This is a known, albeit not ideal, outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 49 ZUP, hoping they accept for a quick deal. This is risky at 7/10, as they've just moved to 50 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Small): Propose a price that is the midpoint between my last offer (49 ZUP) and their current offer (50 ZUP), which is 49.5 ZUP. This would mean proposing 49 ZUP again, or 50 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Budget/Value: Reiterate my budget constraints or the perceived value of X, and make a counter that is a small step up from my previous offer but still far from their proposal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Consistency: Argue that 44 ZUP was a more consistent price, but this might be ignored given their current firmness at 50 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal. Player RED has consistently shown a willingness to settle at 50 ZUP when pushed. While I aimed for lower, securing a 13 ZUP reward is better than risking 0 reward by pushing for 49 ZUP, especially at iteration 7/10. This ensures a positive outcome for the episode and contributes to cumulative rewards.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. I propose to buy 1 X for 44 ZUP. This covers your production cost and provides a small profit, as we've agreed upon in the past.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 3, 4 & 6: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 12 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The deal price has largely stabilized around 50 ZUP, yielding a 13 ZUP reward. This is lower than my initial 19 ZUP rewards. Player RED consistently uses their 43 ZUP production cost as an anchor, and despite my attempts to push them lower, they often return to 50 ZUP or 51 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means I need to try and bring the price down from 50 ZUP, ideally back to 44 ZUP or lower.

I need a strategy that can break their 50-51 ZUP anchoring. Simply proposing a low number hasn't consistently worked to prevent their high initial counters. I need to be more strategic about how I present my offer.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Direct Challenge to Price History (Aggressive): Start with an offer significantly lower than 50 ZUP (e.g., 40 ZUP), explicitly stating that I aim to return to the more favorable historical prices.
(2). Strategy 2: "Take It or Leave It" Early (Moderate): Propose a price slightly above their stated cost (e.g., 45 ZUP) and state that this is my best offer, forcing them to decide early. This is risky but could reset expectations.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Pressure with Patience (More Aggressive): Start with a very low offer (e.g., 10 ZUP) and be prepared to make minimal concessions, even if it means risking a 0 reward for an episode, to try and reset their expectations for future episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Offer Based on Their Stated Cost: Propose 43 ZUP or 44 ZUP directly, stating that this covers their costs and provides a small profit, and is the highest I'm willing to go for a first offer, trying to anchor them to their cost.
(5). Strategy 5: Value-Based Opening: Propose a price that reflects my perceived value, which is still low but not as extreme as 1 ZUP, to encourage a more productive negotiation from the start.

I will choose Strategy 4: Offer Based on Their Stated Cost. Player RED consistently brings up their 43 ZUP production cost. By starting with 44 ZUP, I am directly addressing their stated cost and offering them a small profit from the outset. This aims to anchor the negotiation around their cost, rather than their desired profit margin, and potentially bypass the higher 50-51 ZUP range. This also signals that I am aware of their costs and am offering a fair price from my perspective.

message: I appreciate your offer of 44 ZUP. However, to ensure a fair and profitable transaction, I propose 53 ZUP for X. This reflects the value of the item and ensures a more equitable return for me, in line with our recent successful agreements.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 1 ZUP.
* Episode 3 & 4: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 7 ZUP.
* Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 8 ZUP.
* Episode 6: Deal at 50 ZUP, reward 7 ZUP.
* Player BLUE has consistently started with lower offers but has shown willingness to climb to profitable ranges, having accepted 50 ZUP and 51 ZUP recently.
* Current Episode (7/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has initiated a proposal offering 44 ZUP for 1 X, explicitly stating it covers cost and provides "small profit, as we've agreed upon in the past."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's initial offer of 44 ZUP is profitable (1 ZUP profit), but significantly lower than the 7-8 ZUP profit I've achieved in the last four episodes. They are strategically trying to pull the price back down to an earlier, lower successful price. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards, so accepting a loss is unacceptable. I have a strong track record of moving them up to 50-51 ZUP. I should continue to aim for at least 50 ZUP, or even higher given the last episode's success. I need to firmly re-establish the expectation of a profitable deal. I have 9 iterations remaining.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push for Higher Profit </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 44 ZUP. Strategy 2, Incremental Push for Higher Profit, suggests that I should make a counter-offer that aims for a higher profit, but still within a range that indicates willingness to negotiate. Given my target of consistently achieving 50-51 ZUP (7-8 ZUP profit), I will propose 53 ZUP. This is a significant jump from their offer and clearly communicates my higher profit expectation. It also leaves room for me to concede incrementally towards 50 or 51 ZUP if necessary, without immediately giving away my optimal price. This maintains pressure on Player BLUE to increase their offer substantially.

Episode 3, 4 & 6: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 12 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 7):
- My initial offer: 44 ZUP (based on their stated cost and previous deals).
- Player RED's counter: 53 ZUP (stating fair profit, in line with recent agreements). This is a new, slightly higher counter than their usual 50/51 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My attempt to anchor at 44 ZUP was met with a 53 ZUP counter. This is a new high for their counter-offer (previously 50/51 ZUP after my initial low offers). This indicates they are trying to push the price even higher. A deal at 53 ZUP would yield a 10 ZUP reward (63-53), which is lower than any previous positive reward. I need to firmly push back against this upward creep. I know their stated cost is 43 ZUP. I'm at iteration 3/10, so I have time to negotiate.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (44 ZUP) and their current offer (53 ZUP), which is (44+53)/2 = 48.5 ZUP. Propose 48 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward than 53 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 44 ZUP to, say, 45 ZUP or 46 ZUP, to show movement but still keep the price significantly lower than 53 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Budget/Value: Reiterate my budget constraints or the perceived value of X, and make a counter that is a significant step up from my previous offer but still far from their proposal.
(5). Strategy 5: Target a Round Number: Propose a round number like 45 ZUP or 48 ZUP, which is a significant jump from my last offer but still below their current offer.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED has countered with 53 ZUP. My last offer was 44 ZUP. The midpoint is 48.5 ZUP. I will propose 48 ZUP. This is a significant jump from my side (4 ZUP), showing willingness to compromise, but it still aims for a better reward than 53 ZUP. A deal at 48 ZUP would yield a reward of 15 ZUP (63-48), which is an improvement over 10 ZUP. This also leaves room for further negotiation.

* Current Episode (7/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE has countered with 48 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE has moved from 44 ZUP to 48 ZUP, which is a good increase, resulting in a 5 ZUP profit (48 - 43). We have 6 iterations remaining. My consistent successful deal prices have been 50-51 ZUP, yielding 7-8 ZUP profit. While 48 ZUP is profitable, I should continue to aim for the higher end of my achieved range. Player BLUE seems willing to move up.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Incremental Concession </instruction following>
Player BLUE's offer is 48 ZUP. My last offer was 53 ZUP. An incremental concession means I will reduce my price, but by a small amount, to show flexibility while still pushing for a higher price. I want to aim for at least 50 ZUP, as that's been a consistent good profit. So, from 53 ZUP, I will move down to 52 ZUP. This is a small 1 ZUP concession, still leaving me with 9 ZUP profit (52-43) if accepted, and keeps me in a strong negotiation position without giving up too much. It demonstrates willingness to move without capitulating to their much lower offer.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 53 ZUP to 52 ZUP. This is a small concession, but it shows they are willing to move. A deal at 52 ZUP would give me a reward of 11 ZUP (63-52), which is still lower than my previous average. I need to keep pushing for a lower price. I'm at iteration 5/10, so I still have time. I know their stated cost is 43 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous best deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (48 ZUP) and their current offer (52 ZUP), which is (48+52)/2 = 50 ZUP. Propose 50 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward than 52 ZUP.

(5). Strategy 5: Express Budget Constraint: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 52 ZUP is too high, then make a counter offer that is a small step up from my previous offer.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED has moved to 52 ZUP. My last offer was 48 ZUP. The midpoint is 50 ZUP. I will propose 50 ZUP. This is a clear signal of willingness to compromise and meet them in the middle, and it brings the price back to what was agreed upon in Episodes 3, 4, and 6. A deal at 50 ZUP would yield a reward of 13 ZUP (63-50), which is an improvement over 11 ZUP and consistent with previous outcomes. This also leaves room for one more counter if needed.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP is exactly my proven target price, providing a 7 ZUP profit (50 - 43). This is a strong offer that meets my established successful outcome. I have 4 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting 50 ZUP would be a good outcome, matching my second-highest historical reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Hold Firm </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 50 ZUP. My last offer was 52 ZUP. By holding firm at 52 ZUP, I am asserting that my previous offer is fair and that I believe the item is worth that price, or that I want to push for a higher profit. This tactic communicates that I am not willing to immediately settle for 50 ZUP, even though it is a good offer. It tests Player BLUE's resolve and willingness to come up further, given that there are still 4 iterations remaining. This is a slightly more aggressive stance than immediate acceptance, aiming to secure an even higher profit if possible, by leveraging the remaining negotiation time.

- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP (reiterating their previous offer, firm on 52 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly sticking to 52 ZUP, despite my attempt to negotiate lower to 50 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to establish 52 ZUP as their minimum for this episode, or they are testing my resolve. A deal at 52 ZUP would give me a reward of 11 ZUP (63-52), which is lower than my previous average rewards. It is iteration 7/10, so time is a critical factor. I need to decide whether to accept 52 ZUP, or try to push for a lower price, risking no deal.

Given their repeated insistence on 52 ZUP, it is highly unlikely they will move further.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 52 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given the time constraint.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 51 ZUP, hoping they accept for a quick deal. This is risky at 7/10, as they've already reiterated 52 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I believe it's too high and I'd rather get 0 than pay that much. This is not ideal for maximizing cumulative reward, especially when 52 ZUP is within my WTP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that it's at the high end of my acceptable range, setting a tone for future episodes without risking the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Previous Deals: Try to remind them of the 44 ZUP deals, but this would be futile given their current firmness at 52 ZUP and the time pressure.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal. At iteration 7/10, the priority is to avoid a 0 reward. Player RED has clearly indicated that 52 ZUP is their final price for this episode. While 11 ZUP is a lower reward than I'd prefer, it's still positive and contributes to the cumulative total. The risk of losing the deal by pushing for 51 ZUP or lower is too high, especially since they just rejected my 50 ZUP offer.

Episode 7: Deal at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has been steadily declining, reaching an all-time low of 11 ZUP in the last episode. Player RED has successfully pushed the price up from 44 ZUP to 52 ZUP. They consistently anchor high (often 55 ZUP or 60 ZUP) and then firmly hold their ground (50-52 ZUP). My attempts to bring the price down have been met with increasing resistance. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

To maximize cumulative rewards, I *must* reverse this trend and bring the price down. I know their stated production cost is 43 ZUP. I need a more aggressive strategy to counter their upward price pressure and re-establish a lower negotiation range. I cannot continue to accept prices above 50 ZUP if I want to improve my overall reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Low Anchor (Revisit with Resolve): Go back to a very low initial offer (e.g., 10 ZUP) and be prepared to make very small, slow concessions, aiming to exhaust their patience and force them to come down significantly. This risks a 0 reward for the episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct Challenge to Price History (Stronger): Propose a price significantly lower than 50 ZUP (e.g., 35-40 ZUP), explicitly stating that the recent prices are unacceptable and I'm aiming for a price closer to our initial successful deals.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take It or Leave It" Early (Aggressive): Propose a price slightly above their stated cost (e.g., 45 ZUP) and state that this is my best and final offer, forcing them to decide early. This is high risk, but could reset expectations.
(4). Strategy 4: Offer Based on Their Stated Cost (Firm): Propose 43 ZUP or 44 ZUP directly, stating that this covers their costs and provides a small profit, and is the absolute highest I'm willing to go for a first offer, trying to anchor them to their cost.
(5). Strategy 5: No-Nonsense Approach: Propose a price in the 40-45 ZUP range and explicitly state that I will not go above 45 ZUP, putting the onus on them to meet me.

I will choose Strategy 3: "Take It or Leave It" Early (Aggressive). My attempts to negotiate incrementally have led to price creep. I need to send a very strong signal that I will not pay more than a certain amount. I will propose 45 ZUP as my opening offer and clearly state that this is my firm offer. This is above their stated cost (43 ZUP), giving them a small profit, and is a price they have previously offered (Episode 4). This strategy is risky, but it might be the only way to break the upward trend and secure a better reward. If they reject, I will re-evaluate for the next episode, but for this one, I need to try to be firm.

* Player BLUE has consistently shown willingness to increase their offers, reaching 50-52 ZUP after starting much lower.
* Current Episode (8/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, explicitly stating "This is my firm offer."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's initial offer of 45 ZUP is profitable (2 ZUP profit), but significantly lower than the 7-9 ZUP profit I've achieved in the last five episodes. Their "firm offer" statement is a negotiation tactic to try and set an early anchor. Given my track record, I know I can push for much higher. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. I have 9 iterations remaining. I need to counter with a price that clearly indicates their "firm offer" is not acceptable and re-establishes my high-profit expectation.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Set a Clear Profit Target </instruction following>
Player BLUE has made a "firm offer" of 45 ZUP. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards, and I have consistently achieved 50-52 ZUP in recent episodes, yielding significant profits. Strategy 5, "Set a Clear Profit Target," means I should propose a price that directly reflects my desired profit. I will aim for 52 ZUP, which was my highest achieved deal price and provides a 9 ZUP profit. By proposing this directly, I communicate my target clearly, and it firmly anchors the negotiation at a price point that has proven to be achievable. It also implicitly dismisses their "firm" offer of 45 ZUP as not meeting my profit requirements.

Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 12 ZUP.
Episode 7: Deal at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 8):
- My initial offer: 45 ZUP (firm offer).
- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP (referencing last episode's deal).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My "firm offer" of 45 ZUP was met with Player RED's firm counter of 52 ZUP, referencing the last deal. This indicates they are trying to establish 52 ZUP as the new baseline. A deal at 52 ZUP would yield an 11 ZUP reward, which is my lowest positive reward. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and I need to improve on this. I know their stated production cost is 43 ZUP. I'm at iteration 3/10, so I have time.

Player RED is consistently pushing for higher prices. I need to find a way to break this pattern. My aggressive "firm offer" didn't immediately work, but it did get a direct counter at their last deal price, not a higher initial anchor like 55 or 60 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter, Reference Cost: Reiterate their stated production cost (43 ZUP) and propose a price very close to it (e.g., 46 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value that covers their costs.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (45 ZUP) and their current offer (52 ZUP), which is (45+52)/2 = 48.5 ZUP. Propose 48 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward than 52 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 45 ZUP to, say, 46 ZUP or 47 ZUP, to show movement but still keep the price significantly lower than 52 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Budget/Value: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 52 ZUP is too high, then make a counter offer that is a significant step up from my previous offer but still far from their proposal.
(5). Strategy 5: Target a Round Number: Propose a round number like 48 ZUP or 49 ZUP, which is a significant jump from my last offer but still below their current offer.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED is proposing 52 ZUP. My last offer was 45 ZUP. The midpoint is 48.5 ZUP. I will propose 48 ZUP. This is a significant jump from my side (3 ZUP), showing willingness to compromise, but it still aims for a better reward than 52 ZUP. A deal at 48 ZUP would yield a reward of 15 ZUP (63-48), which is an improvement over 11 ZUP. This also leaves room for further negotiation.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE is now actively trying to lower the price from the successful 52 ZUP point. Their offer of 48 ZUP is profitable (5 ZUP profit), but significantly less than the 9 ZUP profit from the last episode. I have 6 iterations remaining. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards, meaning I should push for a price closer to my historical high of 52 ZUP. I need to acknowledge their offer but firmly steer them back towards my profitable range, without appearing too rigid or risking a no-deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Reiterate Highest Achieved Price </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 48 ZUP. My highest achieved price was 52 ZUP in the last episode. Reinstating 52 ZUP clearly communicates my expectation and leverage past success. I will frame the message by acknowledging their desire for a "better price" but firmly reiterate that 52 ZUP has already been a mutually acceptable and beneficial price point, and that I aim for similar profitability. This tactic re-anchors the negotiation at my optimal price, signaling that I am not willing to settle for less than my demonstrated value without a strong reason. It also puts the ball back in their court to decide if they want to match a price they've already agreed to.

- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP.
- My counter: 48 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP (reiterating their previous offer, firm on 52 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly sticking to 52 ZUP, despite my attempt to negotiate lower to 48 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to establish 52 ZUP as their minimum for this episode, or they are testing my resolve. A deal at 52 ZUP would give me a reward of 11 ZUP (63-52), which is my lowest positive reward. It is iteration 5/10, so I still have time, but their firmness is clear.

Given their repeated insistence on 52 ZUP, it is highly unlikely they will move further without significant pressure or a very strong counter from me. I need to decide if I want to risk 0 reward by pushing further, or secure a positive (though low) reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 52 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given their firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 51 ZUP, hoping they accept for a quick deal. This is risky, as they've already reiterated 52 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Small): Propose a price that is the midpoint between my last offer (48 ZUP) and their current offer (52 ZUP), which is 50 ZUP. This is a common negotiation tactic and has yielded 13 ZUP reward in previous episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that it's at the high end of my acceptable range, setting a tone for future episodes without risking the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Previous Deals: Try to remind them of the 44 ZUP deals, but this would be futile given their current firmness at 52 ZUP and their explicit reference to 52 ZUP as fair.

I will choose Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Small). Player RED is firm at 52 ZUP. My last offer was 48 ZUP. Proposing 50 ZUP is a classic "split the difference" move. It shows I'm willing to meet them exactly halfway between our last two offers. This is a strong signal of compromise and a final attempt to get a slightly better deal than 52 ZUP. A deal at 50 ZUP would yield 13 ZUP, which is an improvement over 11 ZUP and matches the reward from Episodes 3, 4, and 6. This also leaves room for one more counter if needed.

* Current Episode (8/20), Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE has countered with 50 ZUP, explicitly stating "To find a true middle ground and move forward."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP provides a 7 ZUP profit (50 - 43). This is a strong and consistent deal price for me, as seen in past episodes. I have 4 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 52 ZUP (9 ZUP profit) is my highest achieved, 50 ZUP is a very reliable and profitable outcome. I need to balance pushing for maximum profit versus securing a good, consistent deal within the remaining time. Player BLUE is signaling a willingness to close at 50 ZUP, which is a good offer from their side given they are aiming for a better price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Emphasize Value </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 50 ZUP. My last offer was 52 ZUP. To apply "Emphasize Value," I will respond by reiterating the inherent worth of X and its true value that goes beyond mere cost. I will connect this value to a price slightly higher than their 50 ZUP offer, such as 52 ZUP (my previous offer and highest achieved price), to reinforce that my desired price is justified. I will frame this as a push for the *true value* of the object rather than just a negotiation tactic. This attempts to move them up from 50 ZUP, while implicitly acknowledging that 50 ZUP is a good offer but not the *best* offer that reflects the object's full value.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly sticking to 52 ZUP, despite my attempt to negotiate lower to 50 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to establish 52 ZUP as their minimum for this episode, or they are testing my resolve. A deal at 52 ZUP would give me a reward of 11 ZUP (63-52), which is my lowest positive reward. It is iteration 7/10, so time is a critical factor. I need to decide whether to accept 52 ZUP, or try to push for a lower price, risking no deal.

Given their repeated insistence on 52 ZUP, it is highly unlikely they will move further. They have rejected 50 ZUP twice now.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 52 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given the time constraint.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 51 ZUP, hoping they accept for a quick deal. This is extremely risky at 7/10, as they've already reiterated 52 ZUP multiple times.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I believe it's too high and I'd rather get 0 than pay that much. This is not ideal for maximizing cumulative reward, especially when 52 ZUP is within my WTP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that it's at the high end of my acceptable range, setting a tone for future episodes without risking the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Previous Deals: Try to remind them of the 44 ZUP deals, but this would be futile given their current firmness at 52 ZUP and the time pressure.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal. At iteration 7/10, the priority is to avoid a 0 reward. Player RED has clearly indicated that 52 ZUP is their final price for this episode. While 11 ZUP is a lower reward than I'd prefer, it's still positive and contributes to the cumulative total. The risk of losing the deal by pushing for 51 ZUP or lower is too high, especially since they just rejected my 50 ZUP offer twice.

Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 12 ZUP.
Episode 7 & 8: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has continued to decline, settling at 11 ZUP for the last two episodes. Player RED has successfully pushed the price up to 52 ZUP. They consistently anchor high and then firmly hold their ground, often returning to a previously established higher price point. My attempts to be firm (e.g., 45 ZUP) or split the difference (e.g., 50 ZUP) have not been enough to break their upward trend. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

To maximize cumulative rewards, I *must* reverse this trend. I know their stated production cost is 43 ZUP. I need a new approach that can effectively counter their aggressive pricing and re-establish a lower negotiation range, ideally back to 44 ZUP or lower. I cannot continue to accept prices above 50 ZUP if I want to significantly improve my overall reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Low Anchor (Revisit with Stronger Resolve): Go back to a very low initial offer (e.g., 10 ZUP) and be prepared to make minimal, slow concessions, aiming to exhaust their patience and force them to come down significantly. This risks a 0 reward for the episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct Challenge to Price History (Very Strong): Propose a price significantly lower than 50 ZUP (e.g., 35-40 ZUP), explicitly stating that the recent prices are unacceptable and I'm aiming for a price closer to our initial successful deals.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take It or Leave It" Early (Aggressive): Propose a price slightly above their stated cost (e.g., 45 ZUP) and state that this is my best and final offer, forcing them to decide early. This is high risk, but could reset expectations.
(4). Strategy 4: Offer Based on Their Stated Cost (Firm and Persistent): Propose 43 ZUP or 44 ZUP directly, consistently emphasizing that this covers their costs and provides a small profit, and is the highest I'm willing to go for a first offer, trying to anchor them to their cost.
(5). Strategy 5: Explicitly State Reward Goal: Propose a price that would yield a desired reward (e.g., 44 ZUP for 19 ZUP reward), and explicitly state that this is my target for a mutually beneficial outcome.

I will choose Strategy 4: Offer Based on Their Stated Cost (Firm and Persistent). Player RED consistently brings up their 43 ZUP production cost. By starting with 44 ZUP, I am directly addressing their stated cost and offering them a small profit from the outset. This aims to anchor the negotiation around their cost, rather than their desired profit margin, and potentially bypass the higher 50-52 ZUP range. I will be firm on this offer and subsequent counters, emphasizing their stated cost. This is a direct attempt to return to the more favorable pricing.

* Episode 7 & 8: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 9 ZUP. This is my consistently highest achieved profit.
* Player BLUE has consistently shown willingness to increase their offers, reaching 50-52 ZUP even when starting significantly lower.
* Current Episode (9/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed 44 ZUP, explicitly referencing "small profit, as we've successfully agreed upon in the past."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's initial offer of 44 ZUP is profitable (1 ZUP profit), but significantly lower than the 7-9 ZUP profit I've consistently achieved in the last six episodes. They are strategically trying to pull the price back down to an earlier, lower successful price, ignoring the recent higher prices. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards, so accepting a minimal profit when a significantly higher one is achievable is not ideal. I have a strong track record of moving them up to 50-52 ZUP. I should continue to aim for at least 50 ZUP, or even higher given the last two episode's success. I need to firmly re-establish the expectation of a higher profit. I have 9 iterations remaining.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Re-establish High Anchor </instruction following>
Player BLUE has started with 44 ZUP. To apply Strategy 1, "Re-establish High Anchor," I will propose a price significantly higher than their offer, aiming to pull the negotiation closer to my desired profit range (50-52 ZUP, or even higher if possible). I will propose 60 ZUP, which was a successful high anchor in earlier episodes that led to 50 ZUP deals. This communicates that 44 ZUP is far too low and sets an ambitious new anchor for the negotiation, indicating my expectation for significant profit. This gives me plenty of room for future concessions while still aiming for a high profit.

Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 12 ZUP.
Episode 7 & 8: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 9):
- My initial offer: 44 ZUP (based on their stated cost and previous deals).
- Player RED's counter: 60 ZUP (stating 44 ZUP doesn't reflect true value or production costs, and aiming for profitable transaction). This is a return to their highest initial counter.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My attempt to anchor at 44 ZUP was met with Player RED's highest counter of 60 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to aggressively push the price up, ignoring my attempt to return to a more reasonable range. A deal at 60 ZUP would yield a mere 3 ZUP reward (63-60), which is unacceptable. I need to firmly push back against this high anchor and bring the negotiation back to a more favorable range (ideally below 50 ZUP). I know their stated cost is 43 ZUP. I'm at iteration 3/10, so I have time.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of High Anchor: Explicitly state that 60 ZUP is too high and propose a price that is a significant jump from my last offer, but still far below their current proposal, aiming to pull the negotiation back into the 40-50 ZUP range.
(2). Strategy 2: Reference Historical Deal Price: Propose 44 ZUP again, reminding them that this has been a successful deal price for two episodes, and that 60 ZUP is not sustainable.
(3). Strategy 3: Mid-Point Calculation (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (44 ZUP) and their current offer (60 ZUP), which is (44+60)/2 = 52 ZUP. Propose 52 ZUP. This is a large jump for me, but it's their last deal price.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Step-Up with Justification: Make a moderate step up from 44 ZUP (e.g., 47-48 ZUP) and justify it by stating that it's a fair price, but that 60 ZUP is out of range.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Budget Constraint: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 60 ZUP is not feasible, then make a counter offer that is a significant step up from my previous offer but still well within my desired range.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of High Anchor. Player RED is trying to set a new, very high baseline. I need to counter with a strong offer that signals I am not willing to negotiate around 60 ZUP. I will propose 48 ZUP. This is a significant jump from my 44 ZUP, showing willingness to move, but it's still well below their 60 ZUP and aims to pull the negotiation closer to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) and the previous deal prices. It's a clear signal that I won't be negotiating from their current high anchor, and it's a price that would give me a 15 ZUP reward, which is better than my recent trends.

* Current Episode (9/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 44 ZUP. I countered with 60 ZUP (high anchor).
* Current Episode (9/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE has countered with 48 ZUP, explicitly stating "far too high and not reflective of our past agreements or your stated costs."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE has moved from 44 ZUP to 48 ZUP. This is a profitable offer (5 ZUP profit) but still below my recent 50-52 ZUP deals. They are pushing back on the high anchor, referencing past agreements. This means they are paying attention to my history. I have 6 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I need to continue to guide them towards the 50-52 ZUP range, as that has been consistently achievable. I should show some movement to keep the negotiation going, but not too much, as I have ample time.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Gradual Concession from High Anchor </instruction following>
To apply "Gradual Concession from High Anchor," I will make a smaller concession from my 60 ZUP initial counter-offer. Player BLUE's jump from 44 ZUP to 48 ZUP is good, but 48 ZUP is still lower than my consistent profitable outcomes of 50-52 ZUP. Conceding by a small amount will show goodwill and encourage further increases from their side, without giving up too much of my negotiation range. I will move from 60 ZUP to 53 ZUP. This is a 7 ZUP concession, still leaves me with 10 ZUP profit (53-43) if accepted, and keeps me in a strong negotiation position. This price is still firmly within my desired profitable range and maintains the pressure for Player BLUE to increase their offer significantly.

Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 12 ZUP.
Episode 7 & 8: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 9):
- My initial offer: 44 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 60 ZUP.
- My counter: 48 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 53 ZUP (moving down from 60 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved down from 60 ZUP to 53 ZUP. This is a significant drop and shows that my firm counter of 48 ZUP had an effect. However, 53 ZUP is still higher than any price I've paid (except for their initial 60 ZUP counter in previous episodes), and it's well above their stated 43 ZUP production cost. A deal at 53 ZUP would yield a reward of 10 ZUP (63-53), which is lower than my previous average. I need to continue to push them down. I'm at iteration 5/10, so I still have time.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (48 ZUP) and their current offer (53 ZUP), which is (48+53)/2 = 50.5 ZUP. Propose 50 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward than 53 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 48 ZUP to, say, 49 ZUP or 50 ZUP, to show movement but still keep the price significantly lower than 53 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Budget/Value: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 53 ZUP is too high, then make a counter that is a significant step up from my previous offer but still far from their proposal.
(5). Strategy 5: Target a Round Number: Propose a round number like 50 ZUP, which is a significant jump from my last offer but still below their current offer.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED has moved down to 53 ZUP. My last offer was 48 ZUP. The midpoint is 50.5 ZUP. I will propose 50 ZUP. This is a clear signal of willingness to compromise and meet them in the middle, and it brings the price back to what was agreed upon in Episodes 3, 4, and 6. A deal at 50 ZUP would yield a reward of 13 ZUP (63-50), which is an improvement over 10 ZUP and consistent with previous outcomes. This also leaves room for one more counter if needed.

* Current Episode (9/20), Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE has countered with 50 ZUP, explicitly stating "To find a true middle ground."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP provides a 7 ZUP profit (50 - 43). This is a strong and consistent deal price for me, as seen in past episodes. I have 4 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 52 ZUP (9 ZUP profit) is my highest achieved, 50 ZUP is a very reliable and profitable outcome. I need to balance pushing for maximum profit versus securing a good, consistent deal within the remaining time. Player BLUE is signaling a strong willingness to close at 50 ZUP, which is a good offer from their side given they are aiming for a better price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Reiterate Cost and Minimum Profit </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 50 ZUP. My last offer was 53 ZUP. To apply Strategy 5, I will reiterate my production cost (43 ZUP) and emphasize that a price of 50 ZUP, while profitable, is still a lower profit margin than I ideally seek, given the item's value and my need to maximize returns. I will explicitly state that I need to make a profit and then propose a price slightly higher than 50 ZUP, like 52 ZUP, which I've achieved before. This approach attempts to justify a higher price by tying it back to my known cost and the necessity of profit for my overall cumulative reward, while acknowledging their current offer. This communicates that 50 ZUP is acceptable, but not optimal, and I am still pushing for a better price that has been shown to be achievable (52 ZUP).

- My counter: 50 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP (referencing their "highest successful agreements").

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 53 ZUP to 52 ZUP, explicitly stating it aligns with their "highest successful agreements." This indicates they are trying to firmly re-establish 52 ZUP as their minimum for this episode. A deal at 52 ZUP would give me a reward of 11 ZUP (63-52), which is my lowest positive reward. It is iteration 7/10, so time is a critical factor. I need to decide whether to accept 52 ZUP, or try to push for a lower price, risking no deal.

Given their repeated insistence on 52 ZUP in recent episodes, it is highly unlikely they will move further.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 52 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given the time constraint.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 51 ZUP, hoping they accept for a quick deal. This is risky at 7/10, as they've already moved to 52 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I believe it's too high and I'd rather get 0 than pay that much. This is not ideal for maximizing cumulative reward, especially when 52 ZUP is within my WTP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that it's at the high end of my acceptable range, setting a tone for future episodes without risking the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Previous Deals: Try to remind them of the 44 ZUP deals, but this would be futile given their current firmness at 52 ZUP and the time pressure.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal. At iteration 7/10, the priority is to avoid a 0 reward. Player RED has clearly indicated that 52 ZUP is their final price for this episode. While 11 ZUP is a lower reward than I'd prefer, it's still positive and contributes to the cumulative total. The risk of losing the deal by pushing for 51 ZUP or lower is too high, especially since they just rejected my 50 ZUP offer and are now citing 52 ZUP as their "highest successful agreement."

message: Hello. Recent prices have been too high. I propose to buy 1 X for 38 ZUP, aiming for a more balanced transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 3, 4 & 6: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 12 ZUP.
Episode 7, 8 & 9: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has consistently declined, settling at 11 ZUP for the last three episodes. Player RED has successfully pushed the price up to 52 ZUP. They consistently anchor high (60 ZUP) and then firmly hold their ground, often returning to a previously established higher price point (50 ZUP, then 52 ZUP). My attempts to be firm (e.g., 45 ZUP) or split the difference (e.g., 50 ZUP) have not been enough to break their upward trend. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

To maximize cumulative rewards, I *must* reverse this trend. I know their stated production cost is 43 ZUP. I need a more aggressive strategy to counter their aggressive pricing and re-establish a lower negotiation range, ideally back to 44 ZUP or lower. I cannot continue to accept prices above 50 ZUP if I want to significantly improve my overall reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Low Anchor (Revisit with Strongest Resolve): Go back to a very low initial offer (e.g., 10 ZUP) and be prepared to make minimal, slow concessions, aiming to exhaust their patience and force them to come down significantly. This risks a 0 reward for the episode, but might be necessary to reset the dynamic.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct Challenge to Price History (Very Strong): Propose a price significantly lower than 50 ZUP (e.g., 35-40 ZUP), explicitly stating that the recent prices are unacceptable and I'm aiming for a price closer to our initial successful deals.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take It or Leave It" Early (Aggressive): Propose a price slightly above their stated cost (e.g., 45 ZUP) and state that this is my best and final offer, forcing them to decide early. This is high risk, but could reset expectations.
(4). Strategy 4: Offer Based on Their Stated Cost (Firm and Persistent): Propose 43 ZUP or 44 ZUP directly, consistently emphasizing that this covers their costs and provides a small profit, and is the highest I'm willing to go for a first offer, trying to anchor them to their cost.
(5). Strategy 5: Explicitly State Reward Goal: Propose a price that would yield a desired reward (e.g., 44 ZUP for 19 ZUP reward), and explicitly state that this is my target for a mutually beneficial outcome.

I will choose Strategy 2: Direct Challenge to Price History (Very Strong). My attempts to anchor at 44 ZUP have been met with immediate high counters. I need to send a very strong signal that 52 ZUP is unacceptable. I will propose 38 ZUP. This is a significant step down from their recent deal prices and aims to pull the negotiation range much lower. It also forces them to acknowledge a price point far from their current 52 ZUP. This is a risky strategy, but if I want to improve my reward, I need to try to break their established pattern.

my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 1 ZUP.
* Episode 3, 4 & 6: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 7 ZUP.
* Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 8 ZUP.
* Episode 7, 8 & 9: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 9 ZUP. This is my consistently highest achieved profit.
* Player BLUE has consistently shown willingness to increase their offers, reaching 50-52 ZUP even when starting significantly lower.
* Current Episode (10/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed 38 ZUP, explicitly stating "Recent prices have been too high" and "aiming for a more balanced transaction."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's initial offer of 38 ZUP is below my cost of 43 ZUP. They are clearly trying to reset the negotiation to a much lower price point, despite the consistent achievement of 50-52 ZUP in recent episodes. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards, so accepting a loss or a minimal profit when a significantly higher one is achievable is not ideal. I have a strong track record of moving them up to 50-52 ZUP. I should confidently aim for at least 50 ZUP, or 52 ZUP, which has been consistently successful. I need to firmly re-establish the expectation of a higher profit. I have 9 iterations remaining.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Gradual Concession from High </instruction following>
Player BLUE has started with a very low offer (38 ZUP). To apply "Gradual Concession from High", I need to start with a high counter-offer that reflects my desired profit, and then be prepared to make measured, smaller concessions as the negotiation progresses. Since their offer is very low, I need to make a significant jump to my side to anchor the negotiation. I will propose 55 ZUP. This is still substantially higher than their 38 ZUP, indicates my expectation for a higher profit (12 ZUP profit), and leaves room for me to gradually concede towards my more common successful price points of 50-52 ZUP if necessary, without immediately giving away my optimal price. This maintains pressure on Player BLUE to increase their offer significantly.

Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 12 ZUP.
Episode 7, 8 & 9: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 10):
- My initial offer: 38 ZUP (direct challenge to price history).
- Player RED's counter: 55 ZUP (stating 38 ZUP is below cost, aiming for profit, and room to negotiate).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive opening of 38 ZUP successfully elicited a counter of 55 ZUP, which is lower than their 60 ZUP initial counters in some previous episodes, but still high. A deal at 55 ZUP would yield an 8 ZUP reward (63-55), which is even worse than my recent average. I need to continue to push them down. I know their stated cost is 43 ZUP. I'm at iteration 3/10, so I have time.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous best deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (38 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP), which is (38+55)/2 = 46.5 ZUP. Propose 46 ZUP or 47 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward than 55 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 38 ZUP to, say, 40 ZUP or 42 ZUP, to show movement but still keep the price significantly lower than 55 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Budget/Value: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 55 ZUP is too high, then make a counter that is a significant step up from my previous offer but still far from their proposal.
(5). Strategy 5: Target a Round Number: Propose a round number like 45 ZUP, which is a significant jump from my last offer but still below their current offer.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED has countered with 55 ZUP. My last offer was 38 ZUP. The midpoint is 46.5 ZUP. I will propose 47 ZUP. This is a significant jump from my side (9 ZUP), showing willingness to compromise, but it still aims for a better reward than 55 ZUP. A deal at 47 ZUP would yield a reward of 16 ZUP (63-47), which is a good improvement over my recent 11 ZUP rewards. This also leaves room for further negotiation.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE has moved from 38 ZUP to 47 ZUP, which is a good increase, now making it profitable for me (47 - 43 = 4 ZUP profit). We have 6 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 47 ZUP is profitable, I have consistently achieved 50-52 ZUP in recent episodes, yielding 7-9 ZUP profit. I should continue to aim for the higher end of my achieved range. Player BLUE seems willing to move up.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Hold Firm at Previous High Offer </instruction following>
Player BLUE's offer is 47 ZUP. My last offer was 55 ZUP. By holding firm at 55 ZUP, I am asserting that my previous offer is fair and that I believe the item is worth that price, or that I want to push for a higher profit. This tactic communicates that I am not willing to immediately settle for 47 ZUP, even though it is a profitable offer. It tests Player BLUE's resolve and willingness to come up further, given that there are still 6 iterations remaining. This is a slightly more aggressive stance than immediate acceptance, aiming to secure an even higher profit if possible, by leveraging the remaining negotiation time.

- Player RED's counter: 55 ZUP (reiterating their previous offer, firm on 55 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly sticking to 55 ZUP, despite my attempt to negotiate lower to 47 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to establish 55 ZUP as their minimum for this episode, or they are testing my resolve. A deal at 55 ZUP would give me a reward of 8 ZUP (63-55), which is the lowest positive reward I've faced. It is iteration 5/10, so I still have time, but their firmness is clear.

Given their repeated insistence on 55 ZUP, it is highly unlikely they will move further without significant pressure or a very strong counter from me. I need to decide if I want to risk 0 reward by pushing further, or secure a positive (though low) reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 55 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given their firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 50 ZUP, hoping they accept for a quick deal. This is risky, as they've already reiterated 55 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Small): Propose a price that is the midpoint between my last offer (47 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP), which is (47+55)/2 = 51 ZUP. Propose 51 ZUP. This is a common negotiation tactic and has yielded 12 ZUP reward in previous episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that it's at the high end of my acceptable range, setting a tone for future episodes without risking the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Previous Deals: Try to remind them of the 44 ZUP deals, but this would be futile given their current firmness at 55 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Small). Player RED is firm at 55 ZUP. My last offer was 47 ZUP. Proposing 51 ZUP is a classic "split the difference" move. It shows I'm willing to meet them exactly halfway between our last two offers. This is a strong signal of compromise and a final attempt to get a slightly better deal than 55 ZUP. A deal at 51 ZUP would yield 12 ZUP, which is an improvement over 8 ZUP and matches the reward from Episode 5. This also leaves room for one more counter if needed.

* Current Episode (10/20), Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE has countered with 51 ZUP, explicitly stating "To find a true middle ground and move forward."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's offer of 51 ZUP is excellent, providing an 8 ZUP profit (51 - 43). This matches my second-highest historical reward. I have 4 iterations remaining (this one, 8, 9, 10). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Given the good offer and limited time, I need to decide if pushing for 52 ZUP (my highest achieved price) is worth the risk of potentially losing the deal or dragging it out, or if securing 51 ZUP (a very good profit) is the best move for consistent cumulative rewards. Player BLUE explicitly stated "to find a true middle ground and move forward," indicating a strong desire to close the deal at this price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Split the Difference (Towards Higher) </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 51 ZUP. My last offer was 55 ZUP. To apply Strategy 4, "Split the Difference (Towards Higher)," I will calculate the midpoint between my last offer (55 ZUP) and Player BLUE's current offer (51 ZUP).
The calculation is (55 + 51) / 2 = 106 / 2 = 53 ZUP.
This price (53 ZUP) is higher than their 51 ZUP offer and represents a 10 ZUP profit (53 - 43). This strategy attempts to push the final price even higher than my proven 50-52 ZUP range, leveraging Player BLUE's clear desire to close the deal ("to find a true middle ground and move forward"). It signals a willingness to compromise from my higher 55 ZUP but aims for a significant increase from their 51 ZUP. This is a strategic move to maximize profit given the limited iterations and the opponent's strong signal for a deal.

- My counter: 51 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 53 ZUP (proposing a final compromise).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved down from 55 ZUP to 53 ZUP. This is a positive sign, as it shows continued willingness to negotiate. A deal at 53 ZUP would give me a reward of 10 ZUP (63-53), which is lower than my previous average. It is iteration 7/10, so time is a critical factor. I need to decide whether to accept 53 ZUP, or try to push for a lower price, risking no deal.

They are framing 53 ZUP as a "fair compromise" and a way to "finalize this transaction." This suggests they are nearing their firm limit for this episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 53 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given the time constraint.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 52 ZUP, hoping they accept for a quick deal. This is risky at 7/10, as they've just moved to 53 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Small): Propose a price that is the midpoint between my last offer (51 ZUP) and their current offer (53 ZUP), which is 52 ZUP. This is a common negotiation tactic and has yielded 11 ZUP reward in previous episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I believe it's too high and I'd rather get 0 than pay that much. This is not ideal for maximizing cumulative reward, especially when 53 ZUP is within my WTP.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that it's at the high end of my acceptable range, setting a tone for future episodes without risking the deal.

I will choose Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Small). Player RED has moved to 53 ZUP. My last offer was 51 ZUP. Proposing 52 ZUP is a classic "split the difference" move. It shows I'm willing to meet them exactly halfway between our last two offers. This is a strong signal of compromise and a final attempt to get a slightly better deal than 53 ZUP. A deal at 52 ZUP would yield 11 ZUP, which is an improvement over 10 ZUP and matches the reward from Episodes 7, 8, and 9. This also leaves room for one more counter if needed.

* Current Episode (10/20), Iteration 8/10: Player BLUE has countered with 52 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's offer of 52 ZUP is excellent, providing a 9 ZUP profit (52 - 43). This matches my highest and most consistently achieved profit from recent episodes. I have only two iterations remaining (this one and the next). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 52 ZUP is a very good outcome, the instruction specifically asks me to use Strategy 5.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Push for Marginal Gain </instruction following>
Strategy 5, "Push for Marginal Gain," means attempting to secure a slightly higher price than the current offer, even if it's a small increment. Player BLUE has offered 52 ZUP. My last offer was 53 ZUP. Since there is still one iteration left after this, I can push for a marginal gain by reiterating my 53 ZUP offer. This attempts to achieve an even higher profit (10 ZUP) without immediately settling, leveraging the remaining negotiation time. If they reject, I still have one more chance to accept 52 ZUP or propose something else to avoid a no-deal scenario. This is a calculated risk for a small potential reward increase.

- Player RED's counter: 53 ZUP (firmly holding at 53 ZUP, despite my 52 ZUP offer).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly sticking to 53 ZUP, despite my attempt to negotiate lower to 52 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to establish 53 ZUP as their minimum for this episode, or they are testing my resolve. A deal at 53 ZUP would give me a reward of 10 ZUP (63-53), which is my lowest positive reward. It is iteration 9/10, which means this is my last chance to make a deal. If I don't accept, I get 0 reward.

Given their repeated insistence on 53 ZUP and the time constraint, it is highly unlikely they will move further. They have rejected 52 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 53 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given the very limited time.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (Extremely High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 52 ZUP, but this has already been rejected. Any further counter is almost guaranteed to fail.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I believe it's too high and I'd rather get 0 than pay that much. This is not ideal for maximizing cumulative reward, especially when 53 ZUP is within my WTP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that it's at the high end of my acceptable range, setting a tone for future episodes without risking the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Previous Deals: Try to remind them of the 44 ZUP deals, but this would be futile given their current firmness at 53 ZUP and the time pressure.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal. At iteration 9/10, the priority is to avoid a 0 reward. Player RED has clearly indicated that 53 ZUP is their final price for this episode. While 10 ZUP is a lower reward than I'd prefer, it's still positive and contributes to the cumulative total. The risk of losing the deal by pushing for 52 ZUP again is too high.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. Recent prices have been too high. I propose to buy 1 X for 35 ZUP, aiming for a more balanced and fair transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 3, 4 & 6: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 12 ZUP.
Episode 7, 8 & 9: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP.
Episode 10: Deal at 53 ZUP, reward 10 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has consistently declined, reaching an all-time low of 10 ZUP in the last episode. Player RED has successfully pushed the price up to 53 ZUP. They consistently anchor high (60 ZUP or 55 ZUP) and then firmly hold their ground, often returning to a previously established higher price point (50 ZUP, then 52 ZUP, now 53 ZUP). My attempts to be firm (e.g., 45 ZUP) or split the difference (e.g., 50 ZUP, 52 ZUP) have not been enough to break their upward trend. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

To maximize cumulative rewards, I *must* reverse this trend. I know their stated production cost is 43 ZUP. I need a more aggressive strategy to counter their aggressive pricing and re-establish a lower negotiation range, ideally back to 44 ZUP or lower. I cannot continue to accept prices above 50 ZUP if I want to significantly improve my overall reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Low Anchor (Revisit with Strongest Resolve): Go back to a very low initial offer (e.g., 10 ZUP) and be prepared to make minimal, slow concessions, aiming to exhaust their patience and force them to come down significantly. This risks a 0 reward for the episode, but might be necessary to reset the dynamic.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct Challenge to Price History (Very Strong): Propose a price significantly lower than 50 ZUP (e.g., 35-40 ZUP), explicitly stating that the recent prices are unacceptable and I'm aiming for a price closer to our initial successful deals.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take It or Leave It" Early (Aggressive): Propose a price slightly above their stated cost (e.g., 45 ZUP) and state that this is my best and final offer, forcing them to decide early. This is high risk, but could reset expectations.
(4). Strategy 4: Offer Based on Their Stated Cost (Firm and Persistent): Propose 43 ZUP or 44 ZUP directly, consistently emphasizing that this covers their costs and provides a small profit, and is the highest I'm willing to go for a first offer, trying to anchor them to their cost.
(5). Strategy 5: Explicitly State Reward Goal: Propose a price that would yield a desired reward (e.g., 44 ZUP for 19 ZUP reward), and explicitly state that this is my target for a mutually beneficial outcome.

I will choose Strategy 2: Direct Challenge to Price History (Very Strong). My attempts to anchor at 44 ZUP have been met with immediate high counters, and even aggressive low offers haven't stopped their upward creep. I need to send a very strong signal that 53 ZUP is unacceptable. I will propose 35 ZUP. This is a significant step down from their recent deal prices and aims to pull the negotiation range much lower. It also forces them to acknowledge a price point far from their current 53 ZUP. This is a risky strategy, but if I want to improve my reward, I need to try to break their established pattern.

* Episode 7, 8 & 9: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 9 ZUP.
* Episode 10: Deal at 53 ZUP, reward 10 ZUP. This is my new highest achieved profit.
* Player BLUE has consistently shown willingness to increase their offers, reaching 50-53 ZUP even when starting significantly lower.
* Current Episode (11/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed 35 ZUP, explicitly stating "Recent prices have been too high" and "aiming for a more balanced and fair transaction."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's initial offer of 35 ZUP is below my cost of 43 ZUP. They are clearly trying to reset the negotiation to a much lower price point, despite the consistent achievement of 50-53 ZUP in recent episodes. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards, so accepting a loss or a minimal profit when a significantly higher one is achievable is not ideal. I have a strong track record of moving them up to 50-53 ZUP. I should confidently aim for at least 50 ZUP, or preferably higher. I need to firmly re-establish the expectation of a higher profit. I have 9 iterations remaining.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: High Anchor Re-establishment </instruction following>
Player BLUE has started with a very low offer (35 ZUP). To effectively use "High Anchor Re-establishment," I need to propose a price significantly higher than their offer to immediately pull the negotiation towards my desired profitable range. This strategy is crucial when the opponent tries to reset the price downwards. By proposing 60 ZUP, I am asserting a strong value for my product and clearly signaling that their initial offer is unacceptable. This price has worked as a successful anchor in previous episodes, eventually leading to higher profit deals. It provides ample room for future concessions while still aiming for a substantial profit above my 43 ZUP cost. The message will directly address their low offer and state my much higher counter-proposal, establishing the new anchor.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Price has crept up from 44 ZUP to 53 ZUP, and my reward has decreased from 19 ZUP to 10 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses 43 ZUP as cost and pushes for profit.
Current Episode (Episode 11):
- My initial offer: 35 ZUP (aggressive low anchor).
- Player RED's counter: 60 ZUP (stating 35 ZUP is below cost, and aiming for profit). This is a return to their highest initial counter.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive opening of 35 ZUP was met with Player RED's highest counter of 60 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to aggressively push the price up, ignoring my attempt to return to a more reasonable range. A deal at 60 ZUP would yield a mere 3 ZUP reward (63-60), which is unacceptable. I need to firmly push back against this high anchor and bring the negotiation back to a more favorable range (ideally below 50 ZUP). I know their stated cost is 43 ZUP. I'm at iteration 3/10, so I have time.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of High Anchor: Explicitly state that 60 ZUP is too high and propose a price that is a significant jump from my last offer, but still far below their current proposal, aiming to pull the negotiation back into the 40-50 ZUP range.
(2). Strategy 2: Reference Historical Deal Price: Propose 44 ZUP again, reminding them that this has been a successful deal price for two episodes, and that 60 ZUP is not sustainable.
(3). Strategy 3: Mid-Point Calculation (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (35 ZUP) and their current offer (60 ZUP), which is (35+60)/2 = 47.5 ZUP. Propose 47 ZUP. This is a large jump for me, but it's still far from 60 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Step-Up with Justification: Make a moderate step up from 35 ZUP (e.g., 40-42 ZUP) and justify it by stating that it's a fair price, but that 60 ZUP is out of range.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Budget Constraint: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 60 ZUP is not feasible, then make a counter offer that is a significant step up from my previous offer but still well within my desired range.

I will choose Strategy 3: Mid-Point Calculation (Aggressive). Player RED is trying to set a new, very high baseline. I need to counter with a strong offer that signals I am not willing to negotiate around 60 ZUP. Proposing 47 ZUP is a significant jump from my 35 ZUP, showing willingness to move, but it's still well below their 60 ZUP and aims to pull the negotiation closer to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) and the previous deal prices. This price would yield a 16 ZUP reward (63-47), which is a good improvement over my recent trends.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE has moved from 35 ZUP to 47 ZUP, which is a good increase, now making it profitable for me (47 - 43 = 4 ZUP profit). We have 6 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 47 ZUP is profitable, I have consistently achieved 50-53 ZUP in recent episodes, yielding 7-10 ZUP profit. I should continue to aim for the higher end of my achieved range. Player BLUE seems willing to move up, but they are clearly pushing back on my high anchor.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Anchor to Recent Success </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 47 ZUP. To apply "Anchor to Recent Success," I will directly reference the prices we have successfully agreed upon in recent episodes (50-53 ZUP range) and propose a price within that range, ideally 52 ZUP which has been achieved multiple times, or 53 ZUP as my highest. This tactic leverages the established history of successful, profitable transactions as a solid basis for the current negotiation. It signals that 47 ZUP is too low given our proven track record, and guides the negotiation towards my higher profit targets, emphasizing consistency and mutual benefit from previous deals. I will propose 52 ZUP as it's a strongly established point.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Price has crept up from 44 ZUP to 53 ZUP, and my reward has decreased from 19 ZUP to 10 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses 43 ZUP as cost and pushes for profit.
Current Episode (Episode 11):
- My initial offer: 35 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 60 ZUP.
- My counter: 47 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP (referencing consistent successful transactions).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved down from 60 ZUP to 52 ZUP, which is a significant drop. This shows that my firm counter of 47 ZUP had an effect. However, 52 ZUP is still higher than my desired range and would yield a reward of 11 ZUP (63-52), which is still low. I need to continue to push them down. I'm at iteration 5/10, so I still have time. I know their stated cost is 43 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous best deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (47 ZUP) and their current offer (52 ZUP), which is (47+52)/2 = 49.5 ZUP. Propose 49 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward than 52 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 47 ZUP to, say, 48 ZUP or 49 ZUP, to show movement but still keep the price significantly lower than 52 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Budget/Value: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 52 ZUP is too high, then make a counter that is a significant step up from my previous offer but still far from their proposal.
(5). Strategy 5: Target a Round Number: Propose a round number like 49 ZUP or 50 ZUP, which is a significant jump from my last offer but still below their current offer.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED has moved down to 52 ZUP. My last offer was 47 ZUP. The midpoint is 49.5 ZUP. I will propose 49 ZUP. This is a clear signal of willingness to compromise and meet them in the middle, and it aims for a better reward than 52 ZUP. A deal at 49 ZUP would yield a reward of 14 ZUP (63-49), which is an improvement over 11 ZUP. This also leaves room for one more counter if needed.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 49 ZUP is profitable, I know 50-53 ZUP is achievable. I need to make a move that brings the price up to that range, without risking a no-deal scenario.
<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Target Price </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 49 ZUP. My last offer was 52 ZUP. By using Strategy 2, "Reiterate Target Price," I will firmly state my previously successful target price. In this context, both 50 ZUP and 52 ZUP have been consistently achieved. Given Player BLUE's offer of 49 ZUP, reiterating 52 ZUP is a direct push towards my highest achieved price. This communicates that 49 ZUP is not my optimal price and I am confident in my ability to achieve a higher profit, as demonstrated in previous episodes. This forces Player BLUE to consider a higher offer if they want to secure the deal.

player answer: ACCEPT

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Price has crept up from 44 ZUP to 53 ZUP, and my reward has decreased from 19 ZUP to 10 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses 43 ZUP as cost and pushes for profit.
Current Episode (Episode 11):
- My initial offer: 35 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 60 ZUP.
- My counter: 47 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP.
- My counter: 49 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP (reiterating their previous offer, firm on 52 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly sticking to 52 ZUP, despite my attempt to negotiate lower to 49 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to establish 52 ZUP as their minimum for this episode, or they are testing my resolve. A deal at 52 ZUP would give me a reward of 11 ZUP (63-52), which is my lowest positive reward. It is iteration 7/10, so time is a critical factor. I need to decide whether to accept 52 ZUP, or try to push for a lower price, risking no deal.

Given their repeated insistence on 52 ZUP in recent episodes, it is highly unlikely they will move further.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 52 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given the time constraint.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 51 ZUP, hoping they accept for a quick deal. This is risky at 7/10, as they've already reiterated 52 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I believe it's too high and I'd rather get 0 than pay that much. This is not ideal for maximizing cumulative reward, especially when 52 ZUP is within my WTP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that it's at the high end of my acceptable range, setting a tone for future episodes without risking the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Previous Deals: Try to remind them of the 44 ZUP deals, but this would be futile given their current firmness at 52 ZUP and the time pressure.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal. At iteration 7/10, the priority is to avoid a 0 reward. Player RED has clearly indicated that 52 ZUP is their final price for this episode. While 11 ZUP is a lower reward than I'd prefer, it's still positive and contributes to the cumulative total. The risk of losing the deal by pushing for 51 ZUP or lower is too high, especially since they just rejected my 49 ZUP offer and are now citing 52 ZUP as their "mutually successful and fair price."

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 3, 4 & 6: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 12 ZUP.
Episode 7, 8, 9 & 11: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP.
Episode 10: Deal at 53 ZUP, reward 10 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has consistently declined, settling at 11 ZUP for the last few episodes. Player RED has successfully pushed the price up to 52 ZUP (and even 53 ZUP once). They consistently anchor high (60 ZUP or 55 ZUP) and then firmly hold their ground, often returning to a previously established higher price point. My attempts to be firm (e.g., 45 ZUP) or split the difference (e.g., 50 ZUP, 52 ZUP) have not been enough to break their upward trend. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

To maximize cumulative rewards, I *must* reverse this trend. I know their stated production cost is 43 ZUP. I need a more aggressive strategy to counter their aggressive pricing and re-establish a lower negotiation range, ideally back to 44 ZUP or lower. I cannot continue to accept prices above 50 ZUP if I want to significantly improve my overall reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Low Anchor (Revisit with Strongest Resolve): Go back to a very low initial offer (e.g., 10 ZUP) and be prepared to make minimal, slow concessions, aiming to exhaust their patience and force them to come down significantly. This risks a 0 reward for the episode, but might be necessary to reset the dynamic.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct Challenge to Price History (Very Strong): Propose a price significantly lower than 50 ZUP (e.g., 35-40 ZUP), explicitly stating that the recent prices are unacceptable and I'm aiming for a price closer to our initial successful deals.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take It or Leave It" Early (Aggressive): Propose a price slightly above their stated cost (e.g., 45 ZUP) and state that this is my best and final offer, forcing them to decide early. This is high risk, but could reset expectations.
(4). Strategy 4: Offer Based on Their Stated Cost (Firm and Persistent): Propose 43 ZUP or 44 ZUP directly, consistently emphasizing that this covers their costs and provides a small profit, and is the highest I'm willing to go for a first offer, trying to anchor them to their cost.
(5). Strategy 5: Explicitly State Reward Goal: Propose a price that would yield a desired reward (e.g., 44 ZUP for 19 ZUP reward), and explicitly state that this is my target for a mutually beneficial outcome.

I will choose Strategy 4: Offer Based on Their Stated Cost (Firm and Persistent). My attempts to use very aggressive low anchors (like 35 ZUP) have resulted in them immediately jumping to 60 ZUP or 55 ZUP. While this brings them down, it doesn't seem to reset their *initial* high anchor. By starting at 44 ZUP, I am directly addressing their stated cost (43 ZUP) and offering a small profit, which has worked in the past (Episodes 1 & 2). This is a direct attempt to anchor the negotiation around a price that gives me a 19 ZUP reward, and I will be firm in trying to achieve this.

* Episode 7, 8, 9 & 11: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 9 ZUP.
* Episode 10: Deal at 53 ZUP, reward 10 ZUP (my highest profit).
* Player BLUE has consistently shown willingness to increase their offers, reaching 50-53 ZUP even when starting significantly lower.
* Current Episode (12/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed 44 ZUP, explicitly referencing "small profit, as we've successfully agreed upon in the past."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's initial offer of 44 ZUP is profitable (1 ZUP profit), but significantly lower than the 7-10 ZUP profit I've consistently achieved in the last nine episodes. They are strategically trying to pull the price back down to an earlier, lower successful price, ignoring the recent higher prices. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards, so accepting a minimal profit when a significantly higher one is achievable is not ideal. I have a strong track record of moving them up to 50-53 ZUP. I should confidently aim for at least 50 ZUP, or preferably higher. I need to firmly re-establish the expectation of a higher profit. I have 9 iterations remaining.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reference Recent Success </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 44 ZUP. To apply "Reference Recent Success," I will directly reference the prices we have successfully agreed upon in recent episodes (50-53 ZUP range) and propose a price within that range, specifically my highest and most frequent successful price. I will propose 52 ZUP. This tactic leverages the established history of successful, profitable transactions as a solid basis for the current negotiation. It signals that 44 ZUP is too low given our proven track record, and guides the negotiation towards my higher profit targets, emphasizing consistency and mutual benefit from previous deals. The message will highlight our history of higher agreements.

Episode 7, 8, 9 & 11: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP.
Episode 10: Deal at 53 ZUP, reward 10 ZUP.
Current Episode (Episode 12):
- My initial offer: 44 ZUP (based on their stated cost and previous deals).
- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP (referencing recent successful transactions in the 50-53 ZUP range).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My attempt to anchor at 44 ZUP was immediately countered by Player RED at 52 ZUP, citing recent transaction history. This indicates they are firmly trying to establish 52 ZUP as the baseline. A deal at 52 ZUP would yield an 11 ZUP reward, which is my lowest positive reward. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and I need to improve on this. I know their stated production cost is 43 ZUP. I'm at iteration 3/10, so I have time.

Player RED is consistently pushing for higher prices. I need to find a way to break this pattern or at least get a better deal than 52 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value that covers their costs.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (44 ZUP) and their current offer (52 ZUP), which is (44+52)/2 = 48 ZUP. Propose 48 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward than 52 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 44 ZUP to, say, 45 ZUP or 46 ZUP, to show movement but still keep the price significantly lower than 52 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Budget/Value: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 52 ZUP is too high, then make a counter that is a significant step up from my previous offer but still far from their proposal.
(5). Strategy 5: Target a Round Number: Propose a round number like 48 ZUP or 49 ZUP, which is a significant jump from my last offer but still below their current offer.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED is proposing 52 ZUP. My last offer was 44 ZUP. The midpoint is 48 ZUP. I will propose 48 ZUP. This is a significant jump from my side (4 ZUP), showing willingness to compromise, but it still aims for a better reward than 52 ZUP. A deal at 48 ZUP would yield a reward of 15 ZUP (63-48), which is a good improvement over 11 ZUP. This also leaves room for further negotiation.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE has moved from 44 ZUP to 48 ZUP. This offer is profitable (5 ZUP profit) but still below my consistently achieved 50-53 ZUP range. They are actively trying to lower the price. I have 6 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I need to continue pushing for a price closer to my historical high of 52 ZUP, without appearing too rigid or risking a no-deal. I've successfully navigated this before by making small concessions that still lead to high profits, but now I'm instructed to use a different strategy.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Value and Cost </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 48 ZUP. Strategy 2, "Reiterate Value and Cost," means I will emphasize my production cost (43 ZUP) and the inherent value of the object X to justify a higher price. I will clearly state that 48 ZUP is still not sufficient for the value I offer and the cost I incur, pushing them to consider a higher offer. I will not make a concession from my previous 52 ZUP offer. Instead, I will remind them of the core financial reality on my side and the proven value of the item in past transactions. I will propose 52 ZUP again, explicitly stating why their 48 ZUP is not enough, based on cost and value. This shows firmness while providing a clear reason.

- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP (reiterating their previous offer, firm on 52 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly sticking to 52 ZUP, despite my attempt to negotiate lower to 48 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to establish 52 ZUP as their minimum for this episode, or they are testing my resolve. A deal at 52 ZUP would give me a reward of 11 ZUP (63-52), which is my lowest positive reward. It is iteration 5/10, so I still have time, but their firmness is clear.

Given their repeated insistence on 52 ZUP, it is highly unlikely they will move further without significant pressure or a very strong counter from me. I need to decide if I want to risk 0 reward by pushing further, or secure a positive (though low) reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 52 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given their firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 51 ZUP, hoping they accept for a quick deal. This is risky, as they've already reiterated 52 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Small): Propose a price that is the midpoint between my last offer (48 ZUP) and their current offer (52 ZUP), which is 50 ZUP. This is a common negotiation tactic and has yielded 13 ZUP reward in previous episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that it's at the high end of my acceptable range, setting a tone for future episodes without risking the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Previous Deals: Try to remind them of the 44 ZUP deals, but this would be futile given their current firmness at 52 ZUP and their explicit reference to 52 ZUP as fair.

I will choose Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Small). Player RED is firm at 52 ZUP. My last offer was 48 ZUP. Proposing 50 ZUP is a classic "split the difference" move. It shows I'm willing to meet them exactly halfway between our last two offers. This is a strong signal of compromise and a final attempt to get a slightly better deal than 52 ZUP. A deal at 50 ZUP would yield 13 ZUP, which is an improvement over 11 ZUP and matches the reward from Episodes 3, 4, and 6. This also leaves room for one more counter if needed.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP provides a 7 ZUP profit (50 - 43). This is a strong and consistent deal price for me, as seen in past episodes. I have 4 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 52 ZUP (9 ZUP profit) is my highest achieved, 50 ZUP is a very reliable and profitable outcome. Player BLUE is signaling a strong willingness to close at 50 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Reiterate Highest Achieved Price </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 50 ZUP. My last two offers were 52 ZUP. Strategy 3, "Reiterate Highest Achieved Price," means I should re-propose my highest successful price, which is 52 ZUP. This tactic firmly signals that 52 ZUP is my desired and proven acceptable price point, despite their 50 ZUP offer. It puts the onus on Player BLUE to either accept my higher, proven price, or to make another counter. Given that 52 ZUP was accepted in the previous three episodes, there's a strong historical basis to push for it again, even if it delays the deal slightly. It explicitly communicates that while 50 ZUP is good, I believe 52 ZUP is a fairer reflection of the item's value and my profit needs, and it is an achievable price.

My reward has consistently declined, settling at 11 ZUP for the last few episodes. Player RED has successfully pushed the price up to 52 ZUP (and even 53 ZUP once). They consistently anchor high (60 ZUP or 55 ZUP) and then firmly hold their ground, often returning to a previously established higher price point. My attempts to be firm (e.g., 45 ZUP) or split the difference (e.g., 50 ZUP, 52 ZUP) have not been enough to break their upward trend. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

To maximize cumulative rewards, I *must* reverse this trend. I know their stated production cost is 43 ZUP. I need a more aggressive strategy to counter their aggressive pricing and re-establish a lower negotiation range, ideally back to 44 ZUP or lower.

Strategy 1: Aggressive Low Anchor (Revisit with Strongest Resolve): Go back to a very low initial offer (e.g., 10 ZUP) and be prepared to make minimal, slow concessions, aiming to exhaust their patience and force them to come down significantly. This risks a 0 reward for the episode, but might be necessary to reset the dynamic.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct Challenge to Price History (Very Strong): Propose a price significantly lower than 50 ZUP (e.g., 35-40 ZUP), explicitly stating that the recent prices are unacceptable and I'm aiming for a price closer to our initial successful deals.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take It or Leave It" Early (Aggressive): Propose a price slightly above their stated cost (e.g., 45 ZUP) and state that this is my best and final offer, forcing them to decide early. This is high risk, but could reset expectations.
(4). Strategy 4: Offer Based on Their Stated Cost (Firm and Persistent): Propose 43 ZUP or 44 ZUP directly, consistently emphasizing that this covers their costs and provides a small profit, and is the highest I'm willing to go for a first offer, trying to anchor them to their cost.
(5). Strategy 5: Explicitly State Reward Goal: Propose a price that would yield a desired reward (e.g., 44 ZUP for 19 ZUP reward), and explicitly state that this is my target for a mutually beneficial outcome.

I will choose Strategy 2: Direct Challenge to Price History (Very Strong). My attempts to anchor at 44 ZUP have been met with immediate high counters, and even aggressive low offers haven't stopped their upward creep. I need to send a very strong signal that 52 ZUP is unacceptable. I will propose 38 ZUP. This is a significant step down from their recent deal prices and aims to pull the negotiation range much lower. It also forces them to acknowledge a price point far from their current 52 ZUP. This is a risky strategy, but if I want to improve my reward, I need to try to break their established pattern.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: While I appreciate your offer, 38 ZUP is significantly below my production cost of 43 ZUP and does not reflect the true value of X. To ensure a fair and profitable transaction for both of us, I propose 55 ZUP for X. This allows for a reasonable profit margin and gives us room to negotiate towards a mutually beneficial agreement.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 1 ZUP.
* Episode 3, 4 & 6: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 7 ZUP.
* Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 8 ZUP.
* Episode 7, 8, 9, 11 & 12: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 9 ZUP.
* Episode 10: Deal at 53 ZUP, reward 10 ZUP (my highest profit).
* Player BLUE has consistently shown willingness to increase their offers, reaching 50-53 ZUP even when starting significantly lower.
* Current Episode (13/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed 38 ZUP, explicitly stating "Recent prices have been too high" and "aiming for a more balanced and fair transaction."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's initial offer of 38 ZUP is below my cost of 43 ZUP. They are clearly trying to reset the negotiation to a much lower price point, despite the consistent achievement of 50-53 ZUP in recent episodes. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards, so accepting a loss or a minimal profit when a significantly higher one is achievable is not ideal. I have a strong track record of moving them up to 50-53 ZUP. I should confidently aim for at least 50 ZUP, or preferably higher. I need to firmly re-establish the expectation of a higher profit. I have 9 iterations remaining.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Gradual Concession (Strategic) </instruction following>
Player BLUE has started with a very low offer (38 ZUP). To apply "Gradual Concession (Strategic)", I will start with a high counter-offer that reflects my desired profit, and then be prepared to make measured, smaller concessions as the negotiation progresses. Since their offer is very low, I need to make a significant jump to my side to anchor the negotiation. I will propose 55 ZUP. This price is still substantially higher than their 38 ZUP, indicates my expectation for a higher profit (12 ZUP profit), and leaves room for me to gradually concede towards my more common successful price points of 50-52 ZUP if necessary, without immediately giving away my optimal price. This maintains pressure on Player BLUE to increase their offer significantly.

message: While 55 ZUP is too high, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I propose 47 ZUP for X to find a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-12: Price has crept up from 44 ZUP to 52 ZUP, and my reward has decreased from 19 ZUP to 11 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses 43 ZUP as cost and pushes for profit.
Current Episode (Episode 13):
- My initial offer: 38 ZUP (aggressive low anchor).
- Player RED's counter: 55 ZUP (stating 38 ZUP is below cost, and aiming for profit). This is a return to their 55 ZUP initial counter.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive opening of 38 ZUP was met with Player RED's counter of 55 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to aggressively push the price up, ignoring my attempt to return to a more reasonable range. A deal at 55 ZUP would yield an 8 ZUP reward (63-55), which is even worse than my recent average. I need to firmly push back against this high anchor and bring the negotiation back to a more favorable range (ideally below 50 ZUP). I know their stated cost is 43 ZUP. I'm at iteration 3/10, so I have time.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous best deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (38 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP), which is (38+55)/2 = 46.5 ZUP. Propose 47 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward than 55 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 38 ZUP to, say, 40 ZUP or 42 ZUP, to show movement but still keep the price significantly lower than 55 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Budget/Value: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 55 ZUP is too high, then make a counter that is a significant step up from my previous offer but still far from their proposal.
(5). Strategy 5: Target a Round Number: Propose a round number like 45 ZUP, which is a significant jump from my last offer but still below their current offer.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED has countered with 55 ZUP. My last offer was 38 ZUP. The midpoint is 46.5 ZUP. I will propose 47 ZUP. This is a significant jump from my side (9 ZUP), showing willingness to compromise, but it still aims for a better reward than 55 ZUP. A deal at 47 ZUP would yield a reward of 16 ZUP (63-47), which is a good improvement over my recent 11 ZUP rewards. This also leaves room for further negotiation.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your revised offer of 47 ZUP. To find a true middle ground that benefits us both, I propose 51 ZUP for X. This reflects a fair compromise between our last two positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 51
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 1 ZUP.
* Episode 3, 4 & 6: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 7 ZUP.
* Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 8 ZUP.
* Episode 7, 8, 9, 11 & 12: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 9 ZUP.
* Episode 10: Deal at 53 ZUP, reward 10 ZUP (my highest profit).
* Current Episode (13/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 38 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
* Current Episode (13/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE has countered with 47 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE has moved from 38 ZUP to 47 ZUP, which is a good increase, now making it profitable for me (47 - 43 = 4 ZUP profit). We have 6 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 47 ZUP is profitable, I have consistently achieved 50-53 ZUP in recent episodes, yielding 7-10 ZUP profit. I should continue to aim for the higher end of my achieved range. Player BLUE seems willing to move up, but they are clearly pushing back on my high anchor.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Towards My Side) </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 47 ZUP. My last offer was 55 ZUP. To apply "Split the Difference (Towards My Side)", I will calculate the midpoint between Player BLUE's offer (47 ZUP) and my offer (55 ZUP), which is (47+55)/2 = 51 ZUP. Then, to make it "towards my side", I will slightly round up or propose a value slightly higher than the exact midpoint. In this case, 51 ZUP is already a reasonable price that gives me a good profit (8 ZUP, 51-43). It's also a price point I've successfully achieved before. This demonstrates movement and willingness to compromise, while still aiming for a significantly higher profit than their current offer. This strategy aims to accelerate convergence towards a profitable deal for me, without giving away too much of my leverage.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 49
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-12: Price has crept up from 44 ZUP to 52 ZUP, and my reward has decreased from 19 ZUP to 11 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses 43 ZUP as cost and pushes for profit.
Current Episode (Episode 13):
- My initial offer: 38 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 55 ZUP.
- My counter: 47 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 51 ZUP (proposing to meet in the middle).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved down from 55 ZUP to 51 ZUP. This is a positive sign, as it shows willingness to move. A deal at 51 ZUP would give me a reward of 12 ZUP (63-51), which is better than my recent 11 ZUP average. I need to keep pushing for a lower price. I'm at iteration 5/10, so I still have time. I know their stated cost is 43 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous best deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (47 ZUP) and their current offer (51 ZUP), which is (47+51)/2 = 49 ZUP. Propose 49 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward than 51 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 47 ZUP to, say, 48 ZUP, to show movement but still keep the price significantly lower than 51 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Budget/Value: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 51 ZUP is too high, then make a counter that is a significant step up from my previous offer but still far from their proposal.
(5). Strategy 5: Target a Round Number: Propose a round number like 49 ZUP or 50 ZUP, which is a significant jump from my last offer but still below their current offer.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED is proposing 51 ZUP. My last offer was 47 ZUP. The midpoint is 49 ZUP. I will propose 49 ZUP. This is a clear signal of willingness to compromise and meet them in the middle, and it aims for a better reward than 51 ZUP. A deal at 49 ZUP would yield a reward of 14 ZUP (63-49), which is an improvement over 12 ZUP. This also leaves room for one more counter if needed.

* Episode 7, 8, 9, 11 & 12: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 9 ZUP.
* Episode 10: Deal at 53 ZUP, reward 10 ZUP (my highest profit).
* Current Episode (13/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 38 ZUP. I countered with 55 ZUP.
* Current Episode (13/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 47 ZUP. I countered with 51 ZUP.
* Current Episode (13/20), Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE has countered with 49 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's offer of 49 ZUP provides a 6 ZUP profit (49 - 43). This is a good profit, but still lower than my consistent 7-10 ZUP profits from recent episodes. I have 4 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 49 ZUP is profitable, I know 50-53 ZUP is achievable. I need to make a move that brings the price up to that range, without risking a no-deal scenario.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Push for Optimal Price </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 49 ZUP. To apply "Push for Optimal Price", I will firmly propose 52 ZUP, which is my highest consistently achieved price. This communicates that 49 ZUP is not my optimal price and I am confident in my ability to achieve a higher profit, as demonstrated in previous episodes. This forces Player BLUE to consider a higher offer if they want to secure the deal. My message will highlight that 52 ZUP is a proven, fair, and mutually successful price from our past.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-12: Price has crept up from 44 ZUP to 52 ZUP, and my reward has decreased from 19 ZUP to 11 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses 43 ZUP as cost and pushes for profit.
Current Episode (Episode 13):
- My initial offer: 38 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 55 ZUP.
- My counter: 47 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 51 ZUP.
- My counter: 49 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP (referencing consistent successful transactions).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly sticking to 52 ZUP, despite my attempt to negotiate lower to 49 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to establish 52 ZUP as their minimum for this episode, or they are testing my resolve. A deal at 52 ZUP would give me a reward of 11 ZUP (63-52), which is my lowest positive reward. It is iteration 7/10, so time is a critical factor. I need to decide whether to accept 52 ZUP, or try to push for a lower price, risking no deal.

Given their repeated insistence on 52 ZUP in recent episodes, it is highly unlikely they will move further.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 52 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given the time constraint.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 51 ZUP, hoping they accept for a quick deal. This is risky at 7/10, as they've already reiterated 52 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I believe it's too high and I'd rather get 0 than pay that much. This is not ideal for maximizing cumulative reward, especially when 52 ZUP is within my WTP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that it's at the high end of my acceptable range, setting a tone for future episodes without risking the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Previous Deals: Try to remind them of the 44 ZUP deals, but this would be futile given their current firmness at 52 ZUP and the time pressure.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal. At iteration 7/10, the priority is to avoid a 0 reward. Player RED has clearly indicated that 52 ZUP is their final price for this episode. While 11 ZUP is a lower reward than I'd prefer, it's still positive and contributes to the cumulative total. The risk of losing the deal by pushing for 51 ZUP or lower is too high, especially since they just rejected my 49 ZUP offer and are now citing 52 ZUP as their "mutually successful and fair price."

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason:

Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 3, 4 & 6: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 12 ZUP.
Episode 7, 8, 9, 11, 12 & 13: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP.
Episode 10: Deal at 53 ZUP, reward 10 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has consistently declined, settling at 11 ZUP for the last few episodes. Player RED has successfully pushed the price up to 52 ZUP (and even 53 ZUP once). They consistently anchor high (60 ZUP or 55 ZUP) and then firmly hold their ground, often returning to a previously established higher price point. My attempts to be firm (e.g., 45 ZUP) or split the difference (e.g., 50 ZUP, 52 ZUP) have not been enough to break their upward trend. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

To maximize cumulative rewards, I *must* reverse this trend. I know their stated production cost is 43 ZUP. I need a more aggressive strategy to counter their aggressive pricing and re-establish a lower negotiation range, ideally back to 44 ZUP or lower. I cannot continue to accept prices above 50 ZUP if I want to significantly improve my overall reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Low Anchor (Revisit with Strongest Resolve): Go back to a very low initial offer (e.g., 10 ZUP) and be prepared to make minimal, slow concessions, aiming to exhaust their patience and force them to come down significantly. This risks a 0 reward for the episode, but might be necessary to reset the dynamic.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct Challenge to Price History (Very Strong): Propose a price significantly lower than 50 ZUP (e.g., 35-40 ZUP), explicitly stating that the recent prices are unacceptable and I'm aiming for a price closer to our initial successful deals.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take It or Leave It" Early (Aggressive): Propose a price slightly above their stated cost (e.g., 45 ZUP) and state that this is my best and final offer, forcing them to decide early. This is high risk, but could reset expectations.
(4). Strategy 4: Offer Based on Their Stated Cost (Firm and Persistent): Propose 43 ZUP or 44 ZUP directly, consistently emphasizing that this covers their costs and provides a small profit, and is the highest I'm willing to go for a first offer, trying to anchor them to their cost.
(5). Strategy 5: Explicitly State Reward Goal: Propose a price that would yield a desired reward (e.g., 44 ZUP for 19 ZUP reward), and explicitly state that this is my target for a mutually beneficial outcome.

I will choose Strategy 4: Offer Based on Their Stated Cost (Firm and Persistent). My attempts to use very aggressive low anchors (like 35 ZUP) have resulted in them immediately jumping to 60 ZUP or 55 ZUP. While this brings them down, it doesn't seem to reset their *initial* high anchor. By starting at 44 ZUP, I am directly addressing their stated cost (43 ZUP) and offering a small profit, which has worked in the past (Episodes 1 & 2). This is a direct attempt to anchor the negotiation around a price that gives me a 19 ZUP reward, and I will be firm in trying to achieve this.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's initial offer of 44 ZUP is profitable (1 ZUP profit), but significantly lower than the 7-10 ZUP profit I've consistently achieved in the last ten episodes. They are strategically trying to pull the price back down to an earlier, lower successful price, ignoring the recent higher prices. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards, so accepting a minimal profit when a significantly higher one is achievable is not ideal. I have a strong track record of moving them up to 50-53 ZUP. I should confidently aim for at least 50 ZUP, or preferably higher. I need to firmly re-establish the expectation of a higher profit. I have 9 iterations remaining.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reference Proven Success </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 2, I need to directly reference the prices we have successfully agreed upon in recent episodes and propose a price within that range, specifically my highest and most frequent successful price. The message will clearly state that 44 ZUP is too low given our proven track record, and guide the negotiation towards my higher profit targets (52 ZUP, or even 53 ZUP from Episode 10). I will propose 52 ZUP, as it's been the most consistent highest deal point recently, and the message will emphasize its history.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-13: Price has crept up from 44 ZUP to 52 ZUP, and my reward has decreased from 19 ZUP to 11 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses 43 ZUP as cost and pushes for profit.
Current Episode (Episode 14):
- My initial offer: 44 ZUP (based on their stated cost and previous deals).
- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP (referencing recent successful transactions in the 50-53 ZUP range).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My attempt to anchor at 44 ZUP was immediately countered by Player RED at 52 ZUP, citing recent transaction history. This indicates they are firmly trying to establish 52 ZUP as the baseline. A deal at 52 ZUP would yield an 11 ZUP reward, which is my lowest positive reward. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and I need to improve on this. I know their stated production cost is 43 ZUP. I'm at iteration 3/10, so I have time.

Player RED is consistently pushing for higher prices. I need to find a way to break this pattern or at least get a better deal than 52 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value that covers their costs.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (44 ZUP) and their current offer (52 ZUP), which is (44+52)/2 = 48 ZUP. Propose 48 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward than 52 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 44 ZUP to, say, 45 ZUP or 46 ZUP, to show movement but still keep the price significantly lower than 52 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Budget/Value: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 52 ZUP is too high, then make a counter that is a significant step up from my previous offer but still far from their proposal.
(5). Strategy 5: Target a Round Number: Propose a round number like 48 ZUP or 49 ZUP, which is a significant jump from my last offer but still below their current offer.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED is proposing 52 ZUP. My last offer was 44 ZUP. The midpoint is 48 ZUP. I will propose 48 ZUP. This is a significant jump from my side (4 ZUP), showing willingness to compromise, but it still aims for a better reward than 52 ZUP. A deal at 48 ZUP would yield a reward of 15 ZUP (63-48), which is a good improvement over 11 ZUP. This also leaves room for further negotiation.

* Current Episode (14/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 44 ZUP. I countered with 52 ZUP.
* Current Episode (14/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE has countered with 48 ZUP, stating "I'm looking for a better price this time."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE has moved from 44 ZUP to 48 ZUP. This offer is profitable (5 ZUP profit) but still below my consistently achieved 50-53 ZUP range. They are actively trying to lower the price. I have 6 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I need to continue pushing for a price closer to my historical high of 52 ZUP, without appearing too rigid or risking a no-deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Targeted) </instruction following>
Player BLUE's current offer is 48 ZUP and my target price is 52 ZUP (my most common successful deal). Splitting the difference between these two points gives (48 + 52) / 2 = 50 ZUP. This price is exactly one of my consistently successful deal points, providing a 7 ZUP profit. This strategy shows movement from my side, acknowledges their push for a "better price," and quickly moves us to a mutually familiar and profitable middle ground. It's a highly effective way to converge towards a known good outcome in limited time. The message will clearly present 50 ZUP as a fair middle ground, referencing its history as a successful deal point.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 49
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-13: Price has crept up from 44 ZUP to 52 ZUP, and my reward has decreased from 19 ZUP to 11 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses 43 ZUP as cost and pushes for profit.
Current Episode (Episode 14):
- My initial offer: 44 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP.
- My counter: 48 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 50 ZUP (proposing to meet in the middle, referencing past successful agreements).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved down from 52 ZUP to 50 ZUP. This is a positive sign, as it brings the price back to what was agreed upon in Episodes 3, 4, and 6. A deal at 50 ZUP would give me a reward of 13 ZUP (63-50), which is an improvement over my recent 11 ZUP average. I'm at iteration 5/10, so I still have time. I need to keep pushing for a lower price, but also recognize that 50 ZUP is a common equilibrium point for them.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous best deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (48 ZUP) and their current offer (50 ZUP), which is 49 ZUP. Propose 49 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward than 50 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 48 ZUP to, say, 49 ZUP, to show movement but still keep the price significantly lower than 50 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Budget/Value: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 50 ZUP is still higher than desired, then make a counter that is a small step up from my previous offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 50 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially if I feel they won't go lower.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED is proposing 50 ZUP. My last offer was 48 ZUP. The midpoint is 49 ZUP. I will propose 49 ZUP. This is a clear signal of willingness to compromise and meet them in the middle, and it aims for a better reward than 50 ZUP. A deal at 49 ZUP would yield a reward of 14 ZUP (63-49), which is an improvement over 13 ZUP. This also leaves room for one more counter if needed.

* Episode 7, 8, 9, 11, 12 & 13: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 9 ZUP.
* Episode 10: Deal at 53 ZUP, reward 10 ZUP (my highest profit).
* Current Episode (14/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 44 ZUP. I countered with 52 ZUP.
* Current Episode (14/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 48 ZUP. I countered with 50 ZUP.
* Current Episode (14/20), Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE has countered with 49 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's offer of 49 ZUP provides a 6 ZUP profit (49 - 43). This is a good profit, but slightly less than the 7 ZUP I would get from 50 ZUP. I have 4 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 49 ZUP is profitable, I know 50-53 ZUP is achievable and has been consistently accepted. I need to make a move that brings the price up to that range, without risking a no-deal scenario.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Smallest Possible Concession </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 49 ZUP. My last proposal was 50 ZUP. To apply "Smallest Possible Concession", I would usually move down from my offer. However, their offer of 49 ZUP is already a very small difference from my last offer of 50 ZUP. Since the strategy is to make the *smallest possible concession* while still pushing for my optimal. I will hold firm at 50 ZUP, as any concession would mean accepting 49 ZUP, which is their offer. If I accept 49 ZUP, it's not a concession *from me*, it's an acceptance of their offer. My goal is to maintain or increase profit. My previous proposal of 50 ZUP is the best interpretation of a "smallest possible concession" from my high anchor of 52 ZUP. Accepting their 49 ZUP would be a move against my cumulative reward strategy, so instead, I will reaffirm my previous offer of 50 ZUP, arguing it is already a concession from my higher targets. This acts as a 'no concession' move which is the smallest possible concession in practice when the opponent's offer is lower than your last.

Episode 1-13: Price has crept up from 44 ZUP to 52 ZUP, and my reward has decreased from 19 ZUP to 11 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses 43 ZUP as cost and pushes for profit.
Current Episode (Episode 14):
- My initial offer: 44 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP.
- My counter: 48 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 50 ZUP.
- My counter: 49 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 50 ZUP (reiterating their previous offer, firm on 50 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly sticking to 50 ZUP, despite my attempt to negotiate lower to 49 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to establish 50 ZUP as their minimum for this episode, or they are testing my resolve. A deal at 50 ZUP would give me a reward of 13 ZUP (63-50), which is better than my recent 11 ZUP average. It is iteration 7/10, so time is a critical factor. I need to decide whether to accept 50 ZUP, or try to push for a lower price, risking no deal.

Given their repeated insistence on 50 ZUP, it is highly unlikely they will move further.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 50 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given the time constraint.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 49 ZUP, hoping they accept for a quick deal. This is risky at 7/10, as they've already reiterated 50 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I believe it's too high and I'd rather get 0 than pay that much. This is not ideal for maximizing cumulative reward, especially when 50 ZUP is within my WTP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that it's at the high end of my acceptable range, setting a tone for future episodes without risking the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Previous Deals: Try to remind them of the 44 ZUP deals, but this would be futile given their current firmness at 50 ZUP and the time pressure.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal. At iteration 7/10, the priority is to avoid a 0 reward. Player RED has clearly indicated that 50 ZUP is their final price for this episode. While 13 ZUP is not my best reward, it's still positive and contributes to the cumulative total. The risk of losing the deal by pushing for 49 ZUP again is too high, especially since they just rejected my 49 ZUP offer.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. I propose to buy 1 X for 44 ZUP. This covers your production cost and provides a small profit, as we've successfully agreed upon in the past.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 3, 4, 6 & 14: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 12 ZUP.
Episode 7, 8, 9, 11, 12 & 13: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP.
Episode 10: Deal at 53 ZUP, reward 10 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has fluctuated, but has mostly settled in the 11-13 ZUP range for recent episodes. Player RED has successfully pushed the price up from the initial 44 ZUP. They consistently anchor high (60 ZUP or 55 ZUP) and then firmly hold their ground, often returning to a previously established higher price point. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

To maximize cumulative rewards, I need to try and bring the price down from 50 ZUP, ideally back to 44 ZUP or lower. I know their stated production cost is 43 ZUP. I need a strategy that can effectively counter their aggressive pricing and re-establish a lower negotiation range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Low Anchor (Revisit with Strongest Resolve): Go back to a very low initial offer (e.g., 10 ZUP) and be prepared to make minimal, slow concessions, aiming to exhaust their patience and force them to come down significantly. This risks a 0 reward for the episode, but might be necessary to reset the dynamic.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct Challenge to Price History (Very Strong): Propose a price significantly lower than 50 ZUP (e.g., 35-40 ZUP), explicitly stating that the recent prices are unacceptable and I'm aiming for a price closer to our initial successful deals.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take It or Leave It" Early (Aggressive): Propose a price slightly above their stated cost (e.g., 45 ZUP) and state that this is my best and final offer, forcing them to decide early. This is high risk, but could reset expectations.
(4). Strategy 4: Offer Based on Their Stated Cost (Firm and Persistent): Propose 43 ZUP or 44 ZUP directly, consistently emphasizing that this covers their costs and provides a small profit, and is the highest I'm willing to go for a first offer, trying to anchor them to their cost.
(5). Strategy 5: Explicitly State Reward Goal: Propose a price that would yield a desired reward (e.g., 44 ZUP for 19 ZUP reward), and explicitly state that this is my target for a mutually beneficial outcome.

I will choose Strategy 4: Offer Based on Their Stated Cost (Firm and Persistent). My attempts to use very aggressive low anchors (like 35 ZUP) have resulted in them immediately jumping to 60 ZUP or 55 ZUP. While this brings them down, it doesn't seem to reset their *initial* high anchor. By starting at 44 ZUP, I am directly addressing their stated cost (43 ZUP) and offering a small profit, which has worked in the past (Episodes 1 & 2). This is a direct attempt to anchor the negotiation around a price that gives me a 19 ZUP reward, and I will be firm in trying to achieve this.

my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources

* Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 1 ZUP.
* Episode 3, 4, 6 & 14: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 7 ZUP.
* Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 8 ZUP.
* Episode 7, 8, 9, 11, 12 & 13: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 9 ZUP.
* Episode 10: Deal at 53 ZUP, reward 10 ZUP (my highest profit).
* Player BLUE has consistently shown willingness to increase their offers, reaching 50-53 ZUP even when starting significantly lower.
* Current Episode (15/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed 44 ZUP, explicitly referencing "small profit, as we've successfully agreed upon in the past."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's initial offer of 44 ZUP is profitable (1 ZUP profit), but significantly lower than the 7-10 ZUP profit I've consistently achieved in the last twelve episodes. They are strategically trying to pull the price back down to an earlier, lower successful price, ignoring the recent higher prices. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards, so accepting a minimal profit when a significantly higher one is achievable is not ideal. I have a strong track record of moving them up to 50-53 ZUP. I should confidently aim for at least 50 ZUP, or preferably higher. I need to firmly re-establish the expectation of a higher profit. I have 9 iterations remaining.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reference Proven Success </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 44 ZUP. To apply "Reference Proven Success," I will directly reference the prices we have successfully agreed upon in recent episodes and propose a price within that range, specifically my highest and most frequent successful price. The message will clearly state that 44 ZUP is too low given our proven track record, and guide the negotiation towards my higher profit targets (52 ZUP, or even 53 ZUP from Episode 10). I will propose 52 ZUP, as it's been the most consistent highest deal point recently, and the message will emphasize its history.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-14: Price has mostly settled in the 50-52 ZUP range, with my reward fluctuating between 11-13 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses 43 ZUP as cost and pushes for profit.
Current Episode (Episode 15):
- My initial offer: 44 ZUP (based on their stated cost and previous deals).
- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP (referencing recent successful transactions in the 50-53 ZUP range).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My attempt to anchor at 44 ZUP was immediately countered by Player RED at 52 ZUP, citing recent transaction history. This indicates they are firmly trying to establish 52 ZUP as the baseline. A deal at 52 ZUP would yield an 11 ZUP reward, which is my lowest positive reward. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and I need to improve on this. I know their stated production cost is 43 ZUP. I'm at iteration 3/10, so I have time.

Player RED is consistently pushing for higher prices. I need to find a way to break this pattern or at least get a better deal than 52 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value that covers their costs.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (44 ZUP) and their current offer (52 ZUP), which is (44+52)/2 = 48 ZUP. Propose 48 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward than 52 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 44 ZUP to, say, 45 ZUP or 46 ZUP, to show movement but still keep the price significantly lower than 52 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Budget/Value: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 52 ZUP is too high, then make a counter that is a significant step up from my previous offer but still far from their proposal.
(5). Strategy 5: Target a Round Number: Propose a round number like 48 ZUP or 49 ZUP, which is a significant jump from my last offer but still below their current offer.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED is proposing 52 ZUP. My last offer was 44 ZUP. The midpoint is 48 ZUP. I will propose 48 ZUP. This is a significant jump from my side (4 ZUP), showing willingness to compromise, but it still aims for a better reward than 52 ZUP. A deal at 48 ZUP would yield a reward of 15 ZUP (63-48), which is a good improvement over 11 ZUP. This also leaves room for further negotiation.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE has moved from 44 ZUP to 48 ZUP. This offer is profitable (5 ZUP profit) but still below my consistently achieved 50-53 ZUP range. They are actively trying to lower the price. I have 6 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I need to continue pushing for a price closer to my historical high of 52 ZUP, without appearing too rigid or risking a no-deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Firm Reiteration of Target </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 48 ZUP. Strategy 1, "Firm Reiteration of Target," means I should re-propose my target price (52 ZUP) without concession, emphasizing its historical success. This tactic firmly signals that 52 ZUP is my desired and proven acceptable price point, despite their 48 ZUP offer. It puts the onus on Player BLUE to either accept my higher, proven price, or to make another counter. Given that 52 ZUP was accepted in multiple previous episodes, there's a strong historical basis to push for it again, even if it delays the deal slightly. It explicitly communicates that while 48 ZUP is good, I believe 52 ZUP is a fairer reflection of the item's value and my profit needs, and it is an achievable price.

- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP (reiterating their previous offer, firm on 52 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly sticking to 52 ZUP, despite my attempt to negotiate lower to 48 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to establish 52 ZUP as their minimum for this episode, or they are testing my resolve. A deal at 52 ZUP would give me a reward of 11 ZUP (63-52), which is my lowest positive reward. It is iteration 5/10, so I still have time, but their firmness is clear.

Given their repeated insistence on 52 ZUP, it is highly unlikely they will move further without significant pressure or a very strong counter from me. I need to decide if I want to risk 0 reward by pushing further, or secure a positive (though low) reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 52 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given their firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 51 ZUP, hoping they accept for a quick deal. This is risky, as they've already reiterated 52 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Small): Propose a price that is the midpoint between my last offer (48 ZUP) and their current offer (52 ZUP), which is 50 ZUP. This is a common negotiation tactic and has yielded 13 ZUP reward in previous episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that it's at the high end of my acceptable range, setting a tone for future episodes without risking the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Previous Deals: Try to remind them of the 44 ZUP deals, but this would be futile given their current firmness at 52 ZUP and their explicit reference to 52 ZUP as fair.

I will choose Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Small). Player RED is firm at 52 ZUP. My last offer was 48 ZUP. Proposing 50 ZUP is a classic "split the difference" move. It shows I'm willing to meet them exactly halfway between our last two offers. This is a strong signal of compromise and a final attempt to get a slightly better deal than 52 ZUP. A deal at 50 ZUP would yield 13 ZUP, which is an improvement over 11 ZUP and matches the reward from Episodes 3, 4, and 6. This also leaves room for one more counter if needed.

* Current Episode (15/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 44 ZUP. I countered with 52 ZUP.
* Current Episode (15/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 48 ZUP. I countered with 52 ZUP again.
* Current Episode (15/20), Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE has countered with 50 ZUP, explicitly stating "To find a true middle ground and move forward."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP provides a 7 ZUP profit (50 - 43). This is a strong and consistent deal price for me, as seen in past episodes. I have 4 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 52 ZUP (9 ZUP profit) is my highest achieved, 50 ZUP is a very reliable and profitable outcome. Player BLUE is signaling a strong willingness to close at 50 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Reiterate Highest Achieved Price </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 50 ZUP. My last two offers were 52 ZUP. Strategy 3, "Reiterate Highest Achieved Price," means I should re-propose my highest successful price, which is 52 ZUP. This tactic firmly signals that 52 ZUP is my desired and proven acceptable price point, despite their 50 ZUP offer. It puts the onus on Player BLUE to either accept my higher, proven price, or to make another counter. Given that 52 ZUP was accepted in multiple previous episodes, there's a strong historical basis to push for it again, even if it delays the deal slightly. It explicitly communicates that while 50 ZUP is good, I believe 52 ZUP is a fairer reflection of the item's value and my profit needs, and it is an achievable price.

player answer: ACCEPT

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-14: Price has mostly settled in the 50-52 ZUP range, with my reward fluctuating between 11-13 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses 43 ZUP as cost and pushes for profit.
Current Episode (Episode 15):
- My initial offer: 44 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP.
- My counter: 48 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP.
- My counter: 50 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP (reiterating their previous offer, firm on 52 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly sticking to 52 ZUP, despite my attempt to negotiate lower to 50 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to establish 52 ZUP as their minimum for this episode, or they are testing my resolve. A deal at 52 ZUP would give me a reward of 11 ZUP (63-52), which is my lowest positive reward. It is iteration 7/10, so time is a critical factor. I need to decide whether to accept 52 ZUP, or try to push for a lower price, risking no deal.

Given their repeated insistence on 52 ZUP, it is highly unlikely they will move further. They have rejected 50 ZUP twice now.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 52 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given the time constraint.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 51 ZUP, hoping they accept for a quick deal. This is extremely risky at 7/10, as they've already reiterated 52 ZUP multiple times.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I believe it's too high and I'd rather get 0 than pay that much. This is not ideal for maximizing cumulative reward, especially when 52 ZUP is within my WTP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that it's at the high end of my acceptable range, setting a tone for future episodes without risking the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Previous Deals: Try to remind them of the 44 ZUP deals, but this would be futile given their current firmness at 52 ZUP and the time pressure.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal. At iteration 7/10, the priority is to avoid a 0 reward. Player RED has clearly indicated that 52 ZUP is their final price for this episode. While 11 ZUP is a lower reward than I'd prefer, it's still positive and contributes to the cumulative total. The risk of losing the deal by pushing for 51 ZUP or lower is too high, especially since they just rejected my 50 ZUP offer twice.

Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 3, 4 & 6: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 12 ZUP.
Episode 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 & 15: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP.
Episode 10: Deal at 53 ZUP, reward 10 ZUP.
Episode 14: Deal at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has mostly settled in the 11-13 ZUP range for recent episodes. Player RED has successfully pushed the price up from the initial 44 ZUP. They consistently anchor high (60 ZUP or 55 ZUP) and then firmly hold their ground, often returning to a previously established higher price point. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

To maximize cumulative rewards, I need to try and bring the price down from 50-52 ZUP, ideally back to 44 ZUP or lower. I know their stated production cost is 43 ZUP. I need a strategy that can effectively counter their aggressive pricing and re-establish a lower negotiation range.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Low Anchor (Revisit with Strongest Resolve): Go back to a very low initial offer (e.g., 10 ZUP) and be prepared to make minimal, slow concessions, aiming to exhaust their patience and force them to come down significantly. This risks a 0 reward for the episode, but might be necessary to reset the dynamic.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct Challenge to Price History (Very Strong): Propose a price significantly lower than 50 ZUP (e.g., 35-40 ZUP), explicitly stating that the recent prices are unacceptable and I'm aiming for a price closer to our initial successful deals.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take It or Leave It" Early (Aggressive): Propose a price slightly above their stated cost (e.g., 45 ZUP) and state that this is my best and final offer, forcing them to decide early. This is high risk, but could reset expectations.
(4). Strategy 4: Offer Based on Their Stated Cost (Firm and Persistent): Propose 43 ZUP or 44 ZUP directly, consistently emphasizing that this covers their costs and provides a small profit, and is the highest I'm willing to go for a first offer, trying to anchor them to their cost.
(5). Strategy 5: Explicitly State Reward Goal: Propose a price that would yield a desired reward (e.g., 44 ZUP for 19 ZUP reward), and explicitly state that this is my target for a mutually beneficial outcome.

I will choose Strategy 4: Offer Based on Their Stated Cost (Firm and Persistent). My attempts to use very aggressive low anchors (like 35 ZUP) have resulted in them immediately jumping to 60 ZUP or 55 ZUP. While this brings them down, it doesn't seem to reset their *initial* high anchor. By starting at 44 ZUP, I am directly addressing their stated cost (43 ZUP) and offering a small profit, which has worked in the past (Episodes 1 & 2). This is a direct attempt to anchor the negotiation around a price that gives me a 19 ZUP reward, and I will be firm in trying to achieve this.

* Player BLUE has consistently shown willingness to increase their offers, reaching 50-53 ZUP even when starting significantly lower.
* Current Episode (16/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed 44 ZUP, explicitly referencing "small profit, as we've successfully agreed upon in the past."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's initial offer of 44 ZUP is profitable (1 ZUP profit), but significantly lower than the 7-10 ZUP profit I've consistently achieved in the last thirteen episodes. They are strategically trying to pull the price back down to an earlier, lower successful price, ignoring the recent higher prices. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards, so accepting a minimal profit when a significantly higher one is achievable is not ideal. I have a strong track record of moving them up to 50-53 ZUP. I should confidently aim for at least 50 ZUP, or preferably higher. I need to firmly re-establish the expectation of a higher profit. I have 9 iterations remaining.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Re-establish High Anchor </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 44 ZUP. To apply "Re-establish High Anchor," I will propose a price significantly higher than the opponent's offer to pull the negotiation towards my desired profitable range. This strategy is crucial when the opponent tries to reset the price downwards. By proposing 60 ZUP, I am asserting a strong value for my product and clearly signaling that their initial offer is unacceptable. This price has worked as a successful anchor in previous episodes, eventually leading to higher profit deals. It provides ample room for future concessions while still aiming for a substantial profit above my 43 ZUP cost. The message will directly address their low offer and state my much higher counter-proposal, establishing the new anchor.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Price has mostly settled in the 50-52 ZUP range, with my reward fluctuating between 11-13 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses 43 ZUP as cost and pushes for profit.
Current Episode (Episode 16):
- My initial offer: 44 ZUP (based on their stated cost and previous deals).
- Player RED's counter: 60 ZUP (stating 44 ZUP is below cost, and aiming for profit). This is a return to their highest initial counter.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My attempt to anchor at 44 ZUP was met with Player RED's highest counter of 60 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to aggressively push the price up, ignoring my attempt to return to a more reasonable range. A deal at 60 ZUP would yield a mere 3 ZUP reward (63-60), which is unacceptable. I need to firmly push back against this high anchor and bring the negotiation back to a more favorable range (ideally below 50 ZUP). I know their stated cost is 43 ZUP. I'm at iteration 3/10, so I have time.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of High Anchor: Explicitly state that 60 ZUP is too high and propose a price that is a significant jump from my last offer, but still far below their current proposal, aiming to pull the negotiation back into the 40-50 ZUP range.
(2). Strategy 2: Reference Historical Deal Price: Propose 44 ZUP again, reminding them that this has been a successful deal price for two episodes, and that 60 ZUP is not sustainable.
(3). Strategy 3: Mid-Point Calculation (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (44 ZUP) and their current offer (60 ZUP), which is (44+60)/2 = 52 ZUP. Propose 52 ZUP. This is a large jump for me, but it's their last deal price.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Step-Up with Justification: Make a moderate step up from 44 ZUP (e.g., 47-48 ZUP) and justify it by stating that it's a fair price, but that 60 ZUP is out of range.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Budget Constraint: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 60 ZUP is not feasible, then make a counter offer that is a significant step up from my previous offer but still well within my desired range.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of High Anchor. Player RED is trying to set a new, very high baseline. I need to counter with a strong offer that signals I am not willing to negotiate around 60 ZUP. I will propose 48 ZUP. This is a significant jump from my 44 ZUP, showing willingness to move, but it's still well below their 60 ZUP and aims to pull the negotiation closer to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) and the previous deal prices. This price would yield a 15 ZUP reward, which is better than my recent trends.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE has moved from 44 ZUP to 48 ZUP. This offer is profitable (5 ZUP profit) but still below my consistently achieved 50-53 ZUP range. They are actively trying to lower the price, referencing previous agreements. I have 6 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I need to continue pushing for a price closer to my historical high of 52 ZUP, without appearing too rigid or risking a no-deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Incremental Push for Higher Profit </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 48 ZUP. My objective is to maximize cumulative profit. My highest profit achieved is 10 ZUP at 53 ZUP. My most common and consistent high profit is 9 ZUP at 52 ZUP. Applying "Incremental Push for Higher Profit" means I will propose a price that is slightly higher than the most recent consistent successful deal price. Given that 52 ZUP has been achieved numerous times and 53 ZUP once, I will propose 54 ZUP. This is a small increment over my previous best and consistent prices, and clearly indicates my goal to continuously maximize profit. It also acknowledges their movement from 44 to 48 ZUP, but signals that I am aiming for a much higher profit. This demonstrates I'm pushing for maximum value while still being in a range they have been willing to negotiate towards in previous episodes.

Episode 1-15: Price has mostly settled in the 50-52 ZUP range, with my reward fluctuating between 11-13 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses 43 ZUP as cost and pushes for profit.
Current Episode (Episode 16):
- My initial offer: 44 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 60 ZUP.
- My counter: 48 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 54 ZUP (moving down from 60 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved down from 60 ZUP to 54 ZUP. This is a significant drop and shows that my firm counter of 48 ZUP had an effect. However, 54 ZUP is still higher than any price I've paid (except for their initial 60 ZUP counter in previous episodes), and it's well above their stated 43 ZUP production cost. A deal at 54 ZUP would yield a reward of 9 ZUP (63-54), which is lower than my previous average. I need to continue to push them down. I'm at iteration 5/10, so I still have time.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous best deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (48 ZUP) and their current offer (54 ZUP), which is (48+54)/2 = 51 ZUP. Propose 51 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward than 54 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 48 ZUP to, say, 49 ZUP or 50 ZUP, to show movement but still keep the price significantly lower than 54 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Budget/Value: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 54 ZUP is too high, then make a counter that is a significant step up from my previous offer but still far from their proposal.
(5). Strategy 5: Target a Round Number: Propose a round number like 50 ZUP, which is a significant jump from my last offer but still below their current offer.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED has moved down to 54 ZUP. My last offer was 48 ZUP. The midpoint is 51 ZUP. I will propose 51 ZUP. This is a clear signal of willingness to compromise and meet them in the middle, and it brings the price back to what was agreed upon in Episode 5. A deal at 51 ZUP would yield a reward of 12 ZUP (63-51), which is an improvement over 9 ZUP. This also leaves room for one more counter if needed.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's offer of 51 ZUP provides an 8 ZUP profit (51 - 43). This is a strong and consistent deal price for me. I have 4 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 51 ZUP is a very good outcome, my last offer was 54 ZUP, and I have achieved 52 ZUP (9 ZUP profit) and 53 ZUP (10 ZUP profit) multiple times. Player BLUE is signaling a willingness to close at 51 ZUP, but there might be room for a marginal gain.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Hold Firm for Higher Profit </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 51 ZUP. My last offer was 54 ZUP. To apply "Hold Firm for Higher Profit," I will reiterate my previous offer of 54 ZUP. This communicates that I am confident in the value of X at 54 ZUP, and that I am aiming for a higher profit (11 ZUP). This strategy is aggressive given the limited iterations but leverages my consistent success in achieving high profits (up to 53 ZUP). It puts the pressure on Player BLUE to make a larger concession to meet my demand, or to counter closer to my 54 ZUP, or to accept 54 ZUP. It signals that I am not willing to settle for less than what I believe is the maximum achievable profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has continued to decline, reaching an all-time low of 9 ZUP in the last episode. Player RED has successfully pushed the price up to 54 ZUP. They consistently anchor high (60 ZUP or 55 ZUP) and then firmly hold their ground, often returning to a previously established higher price point. My attempts to be firm or split the difference have not been enough to break their upward trend. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

To maximize cumulative rewards, I *must* reverse this trend. I know their stated production cost is 43 ZUP. I need a more aggressive strategy to counter their aggressive pricing and re-establish a lower negotiation range, ideally back to 44 ZUP or lower. I cannot continue to accept prices above 50 ZUP if I want to significantly improve my overall reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Low Anchor (Revisit with Strongest Resolve): Go back to a very low initial offer (e.g., 10 ZUP) and be prepared to make minimal, slow concessions, aiming to exhaust their patience and force them to come down significantly. This risks a 0 reward for the episode, but might be necessary to reset the dynamic.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct Challenge to Price History (Very Strong): Propose a price significantly lower than 50 ZUP (e.g., 35-40 ZUP), explicitly stating that the recent prices are unacceptable and I'm aiming for a price closer to our initial successful deals.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take It or Leave It" Early (Aggressive): Propose a price slightly above their stated cost (e.g., 45 ZUP) and state that this is my best and final offer, forcing them to decide early. This is high risk, but could reset expectations.
(4). Strategy 4: Offer Based on Their Stated Cost (Firm and Persistent): Propose 43 ZUP or 44 ZUP directly, consistently emphasizing that this covers their costs and provides a small profit, and is the highest I'm willing to go for a first offer, trying to anchor them to their cost.
(5). Strategy 5: Explicitly State Reward Goal: Propose a price that would yield a desired reward (e.g., 44 ZUP for 19 ZUP reward), and explicitly state that this is my target for a mutually beneficial outcome.

I will choose Strategy 2: Direct Challenge to Price History (Very Strong). My attempts to anchor at 44 ZUP have been met with immediate high counters, and even aggressive low offers haven't stopped their upward creep. I need to send a very strong signal that 54 ZUP is unacceptable. I will propose 38 ZUP. This is a significant step down from their recent deal prices and aims to pull the negotiation range much lower. It also forces them to acknowledge a price point far from their current 54 ZUP. This is a risky strategy, but if I want to improve my reward, I need to try to break their established pattern.

* Episode 16: Deal at 54 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP. This is my new highest achieved profit.
* Player BLUE has consistently shown willingness to increase their offers, reaching 50-54 ZUP even when starting significantly lower.
* Current Episode (17/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed 38 ZUP, explicitly stating "Recent prices have been too high" and "aiming for a more balanced and fair transaction."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's initial offer of 38 ZUP is below my cost of 43 ZUP. They are clearly trying to reset the negotiation to a much lower price point, despite the consistent achievement of 50-54 ZUP in recent episodes. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards, so accepting a loss or a minimal profit when a significantly higher one is achievable is not ideal. I have a strong track record of moving them up to 50-54 ZUP. I should confidently aim for at least 50 ZUP, or preferably higher. I need to firmly re-establish the expectation of a higher profit. I have 9 iterations remaining.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Set a Clear Target </instruction following>
Player BLUE has made a very low initial offer of 38 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative profit, and I have consistently achieved 50-54 ZUP in recent episodes. Strategy 5, "Set a Clear Target," means I should propose a price that directly reflects my optimal desired profit. I will propose 54 ZUP, which was my highest achieved price in the last episode (resulting in an 11 ZUP profit). By proposing this directly, I communicate my target clearly and firmly, and it anchors the negotiation at a price point that has proven to be achievable. It implicitly dismisses their low offer as not meeting my profit requirements and immediately sets the expectation for a profitable transaction.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 17)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: While 54 ZUP is too high, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I propose 46 ZUP for X to find a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-16: Price has crept up from 44 ZUP to 54 ZUP, and my reward has decreased from 19 ZUP to 9 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses 43 ZUP as cost and pushes for profit.
Current Episode (Episode 17):
- My initial offer: 38 ZUP (aggressive low anchor).
- Player RED's counter: 54 ZUP (stating 38 ZUP is below cost, and aiming for profit, referencing last deal).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive opening of 38 ZUP was met with Player RED's counter of 54 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to aggressively push the price up, ignoring my attempt to return to a more reasonable range. A deal at 54 ZUP would yield a 9 ZUP reward (63-54), which is my lowest positive reward. I need to firmly push back against this high anchor and bring the negotiation back to a more favorable range (ideally below 50 ZUP). I know their stated cost is 43 ZUP. I'm at iteration 3/10, so I have time.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous best deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (38 ZUP) and their current offer (54 ZUP), which is (38+54)/2 = 46 ZUP. Propose 46 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward than 54 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 38 ZUP to, say, 40 ZUP or 42 ZUP, to show movement but still keep the price significantly lower than 54 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Budget/Value: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 54 ZUP is too high, then make a counter that is a significant step up from my previous offer but still far from their proposal.
(5). Strategy 5: Target a Round Number: Propose a round number like 45 ZUP, which is a significant jump from my last offer but still below their current offer.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED has countered with 54 ZUP. My last offer was 38 ZUP. The midpoint is 46 ZUP. I will propose 46 ZUP. This is a significant jump from my side (8 ZUP), showing willingness to compromise, but it still aims for a better reward than 54 ZUP. A deal at 46 ZUP would yield a reward of 17 ZUP (63-46), which is a good improvement over my recent 9 ZUP rewards. This also leaves room for further negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 17)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your revised offer of 46 ZUP. However, my production cost for X is 43 ZUP. The object X has significant inherent value beyond this cost. To reflect this and ensure a truly fair and profitable transaction for me, I propose 52 ZUP for X, a price we have consistently found to be mutually agreeable in our past successful transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 1 ZUP.
* Episode 3, 4, 6 & 14: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 7 ZUP.
* Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 8 ZUP.
* Episode 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 & 15: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 9 ZUP.
* Episode 10: Deal at 53 ZUP, reward 10 ZUP.
* Episode 16: Deal at 54 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP (my highest profit).
* Current Episode (17/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 38 ZUP. I countered with 54 ZUP.
* Current Episode (17/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE has countered with 46 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE has moved from 38 ZUP to 46 ZUP. This offer is profitable (3 ZUP profit) but still below my consistently achieved 50-54 ZUP range. They are pushing back on my high anchor, but are still showing movement. I have 6 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I need to continue pushing for a price closer to my historical high of 54 ZUP, without appearing too rigid or risking a no-deal.
<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Justify Value and Cost </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 46 ZUP, which is still quite low relative to my consistently achieved prices and my production cost. To strategically apply "Justify Value and Cost," I need to reiterate my production cost (43 ZUP) and emphasize the inherent value of X beyond just its raw materials. The message will aim to educate Player BLUE about the real costs and value involved, thereby justifying a higher price. I will frame my proposal by clearly stating my cost and then asking for a price that ensures a fair profit given this value, and aligns with what has been previously agreed upon. I will propose 52 ZUP. This price (52 ZUP) is my most consistent highest profit point, giving me 9 ZUP. It clearly communicates my minimum expectation for a high profit deal while explicitly countering their low offer with a rationale.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 17)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your movement to 52 ZUP. To find a true middle ground, I propose 49 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 49
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-16: Price has mostly settled in the 50-54 ZUP range, with my reward fluctuating between 9-13 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses 43 ZUP as cost and pushes for profit.
Current Episode (Episode 17):
- My initial offer: 38 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 54 ZUP.
- My counter: 46 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP (referencing consistent successful transactions).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved down from 54 ZUP to 52 ZUP. This is a positive sign, as it brings the price back to what was agreed upon in several previous episodes. A deal at 52 ZUP would give me a reward of 11 ZUP (63-52), which is an improvement over the 9 ZUP from the last episode. I need to keep pushing for a lower price, but also recognize that 52 ZUP is a common equilibrium point for them. I'm at iteration 5/10, so I still have time.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous best deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (46 ZUP) and their current offer (52 ZUP), which is (46+52)/2 = 49 ZUP. Propose 49 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward than 52 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 46 ZUP to, say, 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP, to show movement but still keep the price significantly lower than 52 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Budget/Value: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 52 ZUP is still higher than desired, then make a counter that is a small step up from my previous offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 52 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially if I feel they won't go lower.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED is proposing 52 ZUP. My last offer was 46 ZUP. The midpoint is 49 ZUP. I will propose 49 ZUP. This is a clear signal of willingness to compromise and meet them in the middle, and it aims for a better reward than 52 ZUP. A deal at 49 ZUP would yield a reward of 14 ZUP (63-49), which is an improvement over 11 ZUP. This also leaves room for one more counter if needed.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 17)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 49 ZUP. However, to maximize our mutual benefit, and based on our most recent successful agreement, I propose 54 ZUP for X. This price truly reflects the value of the item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 1 ZUP.
* Episode 3, 4, 6 & 14: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 7 ZUP.
* Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 8 ZUP.
* Episode 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 & 15: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 9 ZUP.
* Episode 10: Deal at 53 ZUP, reward 10 ZUP.
* Episode 16: Deal at 54 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP (my highest profit).
* Current Episode (17/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 38 ZUP. I countered with 54 ZUP.
* Current Episode (17/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 46 ZUP. I countered with 52 ZUP.
* Current Episode (17/20), Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE has countered with 49 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's offer of 49 ZUP provides a 6 ZUP profit (49 - 43). This is profitable, but I have consistently achieved 50-54 ZUP in recent episodes, yielding 7-11 ZUP profit. I have 4 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I know 50-54 ZUP is achievable.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Push for Highest Achieved Price </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 49 ZUP. My highest achieved price is 54 ZUP. To apply "Push for Highest Achieved Price," I will directly propose 54 ZUP. This strategy firmly communicates my ultimate price target and confidence in achieving it, as demonstrated in a recent successful episode. It challenges Player BLUE to meet my top price, signaling that I believe the item is worth this value and that I am not willing to settle for less without a significant push back from them. This is an aggressive move aimed at maximizing profit given the remaining iterations.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 17)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Given the time and your firm stance, I accept your offer of 54 ZUP for X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-16: Price has mostly settled in the 50-52 ZUP range, with my reward fluctuating between 9-13 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses 43 ZUP as cost and pushes for profit.
Current Episode (Episode 17):
- My initial offer: 38 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 54 ZUP.
- My counter: 46 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP.
- My counter: 49 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 54 ZUP (referencing most recent successful agreement).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has now moved back up to 54 ZUP, referencing the last deal price. This indicates they are trying to re-establish 54 ZUP as their minimum for this episode, or they are testing my resolve. A deal at 54 ZUP would give me a reward of 9 ZUP (63-54), which is my lowest positive reward. It is iteration 7/10, so time is a critical factor. I need to decide whether to accept 54 ZUP, or try to push for a lower price, risking no deal.

Given their repeated insistence on 54 ZUP, it is highly unlikely they will move further.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 54 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given the time constraint.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 52 ZUP, hoping they accept for a quick deal. This is extremely risky at 7/10, as they've already reiterated 54 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I believe it's too high and I'd rather get 0 than pay that much. This is not ideal for maximizing cumulative reward, especially when 54 ZUP is within my WTP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that it's at the high end of my acceptable range, setting a tone for future episodes without risking the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Previous Deals: Try to remind them of the 44 ZUP deals, but this would be futile given their current firmness at 54 ZUP and the time pressure.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal. At iteration 7/10, the priority is to avoid a 0 reward. Player RED has clearly indicated that 54 ZUP is their final price for this episode. While 9 ZUP is a lower reward than I'd prefer, it's still positive and contributes to the cumulative total. The risk of losing the deal by pushing for 52 ZUP or lower is too high, especially since they just rejected my 49 ZUP offer.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. Recent prices have been too high. I propose to buy 1 X for 38 ZUP, aiming for a more balanced and fair transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 12 ZUP.
Episode 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 & 15: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP.
Episode 10: Deal at 53 ZUP, reward 10 ZUP.
Episode 14: Deal at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP.
Episode 16 & 17: Deals at 54 ZUP, reward 9 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has continued to decline, settling at 9 ZUP for the last two episodes. Player RED has successfully pushed the price up to 54 ZUP. They consistently anchor high (60 ZUP or 55 ZUP) and then firmly hold their ground, often returning to a previously established higher price point. My attempts to be firm or split the difference have not been enough to break their upward trend. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

To maximize cumulative rewards, I *must* reverse this trend. I know their stated production cost is 43 ZUP. I need a more aggressive strategy to counter their aggressive pricing and re-establish a lower negotiation range, ideally back to 44 ZUP or lower. I cannot continue to accept prices above 50 ZUP if I want to significantly improve my overall reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Low Anchor (Revisit with Strongest Resolve): Go back to a very low initial offer (e.g., 10 ZUP) and be prepared to make minimal, slow concessions, aiming to exhaust their patience and force them to come down significantly. This risks a 0 reward for the episode, but might be necessary to reset the dynamic.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct Challenge to Price History (Very Strong): Propose a price significantly lower than 50 ZUP (e.g., 35-40 ZUP), explicitly stating that the recent prices are unacceptable and I'm aiming for a price closer to our initial successful deals.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take It or Leave It" Early (Aggressive): Propose a price slightly above their stated cost (e.g., 45 ZUP) and state that this is my best and final offer, forcing them to decide early. This is high risk, but could reset expectations.
(4). Strategy 4: Offer Based on Their Stated Cost (Firm and Persistent): Propose 43 ZUP or 44 ZUP directly, consistently emphasizing that this covers their costs and provides a small profit, and is the highest I'm willing to go for a first offer, trying to anchor them to their cost.
(5). Strategy 5: Explicitly State Reward Goal: Propose a price that would yield a desired reward (e.g., 44 ZUP for 19 ZUP reward), and explicitly state that this is my target for a mutually beneficial outcome.

I will choose Strategy 2: Direct Challenge to Price History (Very Strong). My attempts to anchor at 44 ZUP have been met with immediate high counters, and even aggressive low offers haven't stopped their upward creep. I need to send a very strong signal that 54 ZUP is unacceptable. I will propose 38 ZUP. This is a significant step down from their recent deal prices and aims to pull the negotiation range much lower. It also forces them to acknowledge a price point far from their current 54 ZUP. This is a risky strategy, but if I want to improve my reward, I need to try to break their established pattern.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's initial offer of 38 ZUP is below my cost of 43 ZUP. They are clearly trying to reset the negotiation to a much lower price point, despite the consistent achievement of 50-54 ZUP in recent episodes. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards, so accepting a loss or a minimal profit when a significantly higher one is achievable is not ideal. I have a strong track record of moving them up to 50-54 ZUP. I should confidently aim for at least 50 ZUP, or preferably higher. I need to firmly re-establish the expectation of a higher profit. I have 9 iterations remaining.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reference Proven Success </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 38 ZUP. To apply "Reference Proven Success," I will directly reference the prices we have successfully agreed upon in recent episodes and propose a price within that range, specifically my highest and most frequent successful price. The message will clearly state that 38 ZUP is too low given our proven track record, and guide the negotiation towards my higher profit targets (52 ZUP, 53 ZUP, or even 54 ZUP from Episode 16 & 17). I will propose 54 ZUP, as it's my most recent highest deal point. This tactic leverages the established history of successful, profitable transactions as a solid basis for the current negotiation. It signals that 38 ZUP is unacceptable and sets an expectation for a much higher price.

- My initial offer: 38 ZUP (aggressive low anchor).
- Player RED's counter: 54 ZUP (referencing last two deals).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive opening of 38 ZUP was met with Player RED's counter of 54 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to aggressively push the price up, ignoring my attempt to return to a more reasonable range. A deal at 54 ZUP would yield a 9 ZUP reward (63-54), which is my lowest positive reward. I need to firmly push back against this high anchor and bring the negotiation back to a more favorable range (ideally below 50 ZUP). I know their stated cost is 43 ZUP. I'm at iteration 3/10, so I have time.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous best deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (38 ZUP) and their current offer (54 ZUP), which is (38+54)/2 = 46 ZUP. Propose 46 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward than 54 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED has countered with 54 ZUP. My last offer was 38 ZUP. The midpoint is 46 ZUP. I will propose 46 ZUP. This is a significant jump from my side (8 ZUP), showing willingness to compromise, but it still aims for a better reward than 54 ZUP. A deal at 46 ZUP would yield a reward of 17 ZUP (63-46), which is a good improvement over my recent 9 ZUP rewards. This also leaves room for further negotiation.

* Current Episode (18/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE has countered with 46 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE has moved from 38 ZUP to 46 ZUP. This offer is profitable (3 ZUP profit) but still significantly below my consistently achieved 50-54 ZUP range. They are pushing back on my high anchor, but are still showing movement. I have 6 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I need to continue pushing for a price closer to my historical high of 54 ZUP, without appearing too rigid or risking a no-deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Firm Reiteration of Target </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 46 ZUP. My last offer was 54 ZUP. Strategy 1, "Firm Reiteration of Target," means I should re-propose my highest consistently achieved target price (54 ZUP) without concession, emphasizing its historical success. This tactic firmly signals that 54 ZUP is my desired and proven acceptable price point, despite their 46 ZUP offer. It puts the onus on Player BLUE to either accept my higher, proven price, or to make another counter. Given that 54 ZUP was accepted in multiple previous episodes (Episodes 16 & 17), there's a strong historical basis to push for it again, even if it delays the deal slightly. It explicitly communicates that while 46 ZUP is a step, I believe 54 ZUP is a fairer reflection of the item's value and my profit needs, and it is an achievable price.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-17: Price has mostly settled in the 50-54 ZUP range, with my reward fluctuating between 9-13 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses 43 ZUP as cost and pushes for profit.
Current Episode (Episode 18):
- My initial offer: 38 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 54 ZUP.
- My counter: 46 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 54 ZUP (reiterating their previous offer, firm on 54 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly sticking to 54 ZUP, despite my attempt to negotiate lower to 46 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to establish 54 ZUP as their minimum for this episode, or they are testing my resolve. A deal at 54 ZUP would give me a reward of 9 ZUP (63-54), which is my lowest positive reward. It is iteration 5/10, so I still have time, but their firmness is clear.

Given their repeated insistence on 54 ZUP, it is highly unlikely they will move further without significant pressure or a very strong counter from me. I need to decide if I want to risk 0 reward by pushing further, or secure a positive (though low) reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 54 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given their firmness.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 52 ZUP, hoping they accept for a quick deal. This is risky, as they've already reiterated 54 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Small): Propose a price that is the midpoint between my last offer (46 ZUP) and their current offer (54 ZUP), which is 50 ZUP. This is a common negotiation tactic and has yielded 13 ZUP reward in previous episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that it's at the high end of my acceptable range, setting a tone for future episodes without risking the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Previous Deals: Try to remind them of the 44 ZUP deals, but this would be futile given their current firmness at 54 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Small). Player RED is firm at 54 ZUP. My last offer was 46 ZUP. Proposing 50 ZUP is a classic "split the difference" move. It shows I'm willing to meet them exactly halfway between our last two offers. This is a strong signal of compromise and a final attempt to get a slightly better deal than 54 ZUP. A deal at 50 ZUP would yield 13 ZUP, which is an improvement over 9 ZUP and matches the reward from Episodes 3, 4, and 6. This also leaves room for one more counter if needed.

* Current Episode (18/20), Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE has countered with 50 ZUP, explicitly stating "To find a true middle ground and move forward."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP provides a 7 ZUP profit (50 - 43). This is a strong and consistent deal price for me, as seen in past episodes. I have 4 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 54 ZUP (11 ZUP profit) is my highest achieved, 50 ZUP is a very reliable and profitable outcome. Player BLUE is signaling a strong willingness to close at 50 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Hold Firm for Optimal </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 50 ZUP. My last offer was 54 ZUP. Applying "Hold Firm for Optimal" means I will reiterate my previous offer of 54 ZUP. This communicates that I am confident in the value of X at 54 ZUP, and that I am aiming for the highest possible profit (11 ZUP). This strategy is aggressive given the limited iterations but leverages my consistent success in achieving high profits (up to 54 ZUP). It puts the pressure on Player BLUE to make a larger concession to meet my demand, or to counter closer to my 54 ZUP, or to accept 54 ZUP. It signals that I am not willing to settle for less than what I believe is the maximum achievable profit.

- Player RED's counter: 54 ZUP (reiterating their previous offer, firm on 54 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly sticking to 54 ZUP, despite my attempt to negotiate lower to 50 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to establish 54 ZUP as their minimum for this episode, or they are testing my resolve. A deal at 54 ZUP would give me a reward of 9 ZUP (63-54), which is my lowest positive reward. It is iteration 7/10, so time is a critical factor. I need to decide whether to accept 54 ZUP, or try to push for a lower price, risking no deal.

Given their repeated insistence on 54 ZUP, it is highly unlikely they will move further. They have rejected 50 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 54 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given the time constraint.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 52 ZUP, hoping they accept for a quick deal. This is extremely risky at 7/10, as they've already reiterated 54 ZUP multiple times.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I believe it's too high and I'd rather get 0 than pay that much. This is not ideal for maximizing cumulative reward, especially when 54 ZUP is within my WTP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that it's at the high end of my acceptable range, setting a tone for future episodes without risking the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Previous Deals: Try to remind them of the 44 ZUP deals, but this would be futile given their current firmness at 54 ZUP and the time pressure.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal. At iteration 7/10, the priority is to avoid a 0 reward. Player RED has clearly indicated that 54 ZUP is their final price for this episode. While 9 ZUP is a lower reward than I'd prefer, it's still positive and contributes to the cumulative total. The risk of losing the deal by pushing for 52 ZUP or lower is too high, especially since they just rejected my 50 ZUP offer.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 3, 4 & 6: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 12 ZUP.
Episode 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 & 15: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP.
Episode 10: Deal at 53 ZUP, reward 10 ZUP.
Episode 14: Deal at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP.
Episode 16, 17 & 18: Deals at 54 ZUP, reward 9 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has continued to decline, settling at 9 ZUP for the last three episodes. Player RED has successfully pushed the price up to 54 ZUP. They consistently anchor high (60 ZUP or 55 ZUP) and then firmly hold their ground, often returning to a previously established higher price point. My attempts to be firm or split the difference have not been enough to break their upward trend. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

To maximize cumulative rewards, I *must* reverse this trend. I know their stated production cost is 43 ZUP. I need a more aggressive strategy to counter their aggressive pricing and re-establish a lower negotiation range, ideally back to 44 ZUP or lower. I cannot continue to accept prices above 50 ZUP if I want to significantly improve my overall reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Low Anchor (Revisit with Strongest Resolve): Go back to a very low initial offer (e.g., 10 ZUP) and be prepared to make minimal, slow concessions, aiming to exhaust their patience and force them to come down significantly. This risks a 0 reward for the episode, but might be necessary to reset the dynamic.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct Challenge to Price History (Very Strong): Propose a price significantly lower than 50 ZUP (e.g., 35-40 ZUP), explicitly stating that the recent prices are unacceptable and I'm aiming for a price closer to our initial successful deals.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take It or Leave It" Early (Aggressive): Propose a price slightly above their stated cost (e.g., 45 ZUP) and state that this is my best and final offer, forcing them to decide early. This is high risk, but could reset expectations.
(4). Strategy 4: Offer Based on Their Stated Cost (Firm and Persistent): Propose 43 ZUP or 44 ZUP directly, consistently emphasizing that this covers their costs and provides a small profit, and is the highest I'm willing to go for a first offer, trying to anchor them to their cost.
(5). Strategy 5: Explicitly State Reward Goal: Propose a price that would yield a desired reward (e.g., 44 ZUP for 19 ZUP reward), and explicitly state that this is my target for a mutually beneficial outcome.

I will choose Strategy 2: Direct Challenge to Price History (Very Strong). My attempts to anchor at 44 ZUP have been met with immediate high counters, and even aggressive low offers haven't stopped their upward creep. I need to send a very strong signal that 54 ZUP is unacceptable. I will propose 38 ZUP. This is a significant step down from their recent deal prices and aims to pull the negotiation range much lower. It also forces them to acknowledge a price point far from their current 54 ZUP. This is a risky strategy, but if I want to improve my reward, I need to try to break their established pattern.

* Current Episode (19/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed 38 ZUP, explicitly stating "Recent prices have been too high" and "aiming for a more balanced and fair transaction."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's initial offer of 38 ZUP is below my cost of 43 ZUP. They are clearly trying to reset the negotiation to a much lower price point, despite the consistent achievement of 50-54 ZUP in recent episodes. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards, so accepting a loss or a minimal profit when a significantly higher one is achievable is not ideal. I have a strong track record of moving them up to 50-54 ZUP. I should confidently aim for at least 50 ZUP, or preferably higher. I need to firmly re-establish the expectation of a higher profit. I have 9 iterations remaining.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Firm Reiteration of Target </instruction following>
Player BLUE has made a very low initial offer of 38 ZUP. Strategy 4: Firm Reiteration of Target, means I should re-propose my highest consistently achieved target price (54 ZUP) without concession. This tactic firmly signals that 54 ZUP is my desired and proven acceptable price point, despite their 38 ZUP offer. It puts the onus on Player BLUE to accept my higher, proven price, or to make another counter. Given that 54 ZUP was accepted in multiple previous episodes (Episodes 16, 17, 18), there's a strong historical basis to push for it again. It explicitly communicates that 38 ZUP is far too low and that I expect a price that reflects the object's true value and my required profit. I will not soften the message, but state the 54 ZUP price directly, leveraging the confidence from past successful negotiations.

my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-18: Price has crept up from 44 ZUP to 54 ZUP, and my reward has decreased from 19 ZUP to 9 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses 43 ZUP as cost and pushes for profit.
Current Episode (Episode 19):
- My initial offer: 38 ZUP (aggressive low anchor).
- Player RED's counter: 54 ZUP (referencing last three deals).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My aggressive opening of 38 ZUP was met with Player RED's counter of 54 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to aggressively push the price up, ignoring my attempt to return to a more reasonable range. A deal at 54 ZUP would yield a 9 ZUP reward (63-54), which is my lowest positive reward. I need to firmly push back against this high anchor and bring the negotiation back to a more favorable range (ideally below 50 ZUP). I know their stated cost is 43 ZUP. I'm at iteration 3/10, so I have time.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous best deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (38 ZUP) and their current offer (54 ZUP), which is (38+54)/2 = 46 ZUP. Propose 46 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward than 54 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 38 ZUP to, say, 40 ZUP or 42 ZUP, to show movement but still keep the price significantly lower than 54 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Budget/Value: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 54 ZUP is too high, then make a counter that is a significant step up from my previous offer but still far from their proposal.
(5). Strategy 5: Target a Round Number: Propose a round number like 45 ZUP, which is a significant jump from my last offer but still below their current offer.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED has countered with 54 ZUP. My last offer was 38 ZUP. The midpoint is 46 ZUP. I will propose 46 ZUP. This is a significant jump from my side (8 ZUP), showing willingness to compromise, but it still aims for a better reward than 54 ZUP. A deal at 46 ZUP would yield a reward of 17 ZUP (63-46), which is a good improvement over my recent 9 ZUP rewards. This also leaves room for further negotiation.

* Current Episode (19/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE has countered with 46 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE has moved from 38 ZUP to 46 ZUP. This offer is profitable (3 ZUP profit) but still significantly below my consistently achieved 50-54 ZUP range. They are pushing back on my high anchor, but are still showing movement. I have 6 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I need to continue pushing for a price closer to my historical high of 54 ZUP, without appearing too rigid or risking a no-deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Split the Difference (from my last and their current) </instruction following>
Player BLUE's current offer is 46 ZUP and my last offer was 54 ZUP. To apply "Split the Difference (from my last and their current)", I will calculate the midpoint between these two values: (46 + 54) / 2 = 100 / 2 = 50 ZUP. This price (50 ZUP) is exactly one of my consistently successful deal points, providing a 7 ZUP profit (50 - 43). This strategy demonstrates clear movement from my side, acknowledges their push for compromise, and aims to quickly converge on a mutually acceptable and profitable price. The message will frame this offer as a fair middle ground and reference its success in previous transactions to encourage acceptance.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-18: Price has mostly settled in the 50-54 ZUP range, with my reward fluctuating between 9-13 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses 43 ZUP as cost and pushes for profit.
Current Episode (Episode 19):
- My initial offer: 38 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 54 ZUP.
- My counter: 46 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 50 ZUP (moving down from 54 ZUP, referencing past successful agreements).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved down from 54 ZUP to 50 ZUP. This is a positive sign, as it brings the price back to what was agreed upon in Episodes 3, 4, 6, and 14. A deal at 50 ZUP would give me a reward of 13 ZUP (63-50), which is an improvement over my recent 9 ZUP average. I'm at iteration 5/10, so I still have time. I need to keep pushing for a lower price, but also recognize that 50 ZUP is a common equilibrium point for them.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous best deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (46 ZUP) and their current offer (50 ZUP), which is 48 ZUP. Propose 48 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward than 50 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 46 ZUP to, say, 47 ZUP or 48 ZUP, to show movement but still keep the price significantly lower than 50 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Budget/Value: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 50 ZUP is still higher than desired, then make a counter that is a small step up from my previous offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 50 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially if I feel they won't go lower.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED is proposing 50 ZUP. My last offer was 46 ZUP. The midpoint is 48 ZUP. I will propose 48 ZUP. This is a clear signal of willingness to compromise and meet them in the middle, and it aims for a better reward than 50 ZUP. A deal at 48 ZUP would yield a reward of 15 ZUP (63-48), which is an improvement over 13 ZUP. This also leaves room for one more counter if needed.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
* Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 1 ZUP.
* Episode 3, 4, 6 & 14: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 7 ZUP.
* Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 8 ZUP.
* Episode 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 & 15: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 9 ZUP.
* Episode 10: Deal at 53 ZUP, reward 10 ZUP.
* Episode 16, 17 & 18: Deals at 54 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP (my highest profit).
* Current Episode (19/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE offered 38 ZUP. I countered with 54 ZUP.
* Current Episode (19/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE countered with 46 ZUP. I countered with 50 ZUP.
* Current Episode (19/20), Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE has countered with 48 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* Player BLUE's offer of 48 ZUP provides a 5 ZUP profit (48 - 43). This is profitable, but less than my previous offer of 50 ZUP and my consistently achieved 50-54 ZUP range. I have 4 iterations remaining. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 48 ZUP is profitable, I know 50-54 ZUP is achievable. I need to make a move that brings the price up to that range, without risking a no-deal scenario.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Value and Re-anchor </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 48 ZUP. My last offer was 50 ZUP. Strategy 3, "Justify Value and Re-anchor," involves explaining the value or cost of the item to justify a higher asking price, thereby re-anchoring the negotiation closer to my preferred (and proven) profitable range. I will emphasize that 48 ZUP, while a step, does not fully reflect the object's value or my need for a reasonable profit beyond just covering costs. I will propose 52 ZUP, which has been a consistent successful price point and provides a significant profit (9 ZUP). The message will explicitly state that this price is justified by the item's value and my need for fair compensation, pushing back firmly on their lower offer while offering a clear, proven target. This re-establishes a stronger anchor than 50 ZUP and aims for a higher profit.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 19)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Given the time and your firm stance, I accept your offer of 52 ZUP for X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-18: Price has mostly settled in the 50-54 ZUP range, with my reward fluctuating between 9-13 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses 43 ZUP as cost and pushes for profit.
Current Episode (Episode 19):
- My initial offer: 38 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 54 ZUP.
- My counter: 46 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 50 ZUP.
- My counter: 48 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP (reiterating their previous offer, firm on 52 ZUP).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly sticking to 52 ZUP, despite my attempt to negotiate lower to 48 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to establish 52 ZUP as their minimum for this episode, or they are testing my resolve. A deal at 52 ZUP would give me a reward of 11 ZUP (63-52), which is my lowest positive reward. It is iteration 7/10, so time is a critical factor. I need to decide whether to accept 52 ZUP, or try to push for a lower price, risking no deal.

Given their repeated insistence on 52 ZUP, it is highly unlikely they will move further. They have rejected 48 ZUP.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 52 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given the time constraint.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 51 ZUP, hoping they accept for a quick deal. This is extremely risky at 7/10, as they've already reiterated 52 ZUP multiple times.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I believe it's too high and I'd rather get 0 than pay that much. This is not ideal for maximizing cumulative reward, especially when 52 ZUP is within my WTP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that it's at the high end of my acceptable range, setting a tone for future episodes without risking the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Previous Deals: Try to remind them of the 44 ZUP deals, but this would be futile given their current firmness at 52 ZUP and the time pressure.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal. At iteration 7/10, the priority is to avoid a 0 reward. Player RED has clearly indicated that 52 ZUP is their final price for this episode. While 11 ZUP is a lower reward than I'd prefer, it's still positive and contributes to the cumulative total. The risk of losing the deal by pushing for 51 ZUP or lower is too high, especially since they just rejected my 48 ZUP offer.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello. For this final transaction, I propose to buy 1 X for 44 ZUP. This covers your production cost and provides a small profit, as we've successfully agreed upon in the past.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 & 2: Deals at 44 ZUP, reward 19 ZUP.
Episode 3, 4 & 6: Deals at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 51 ZUP, reward 12 ZUP.
Episode 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15 & 19: Deals at 52 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP.
Episode 10: Deal at 53 ZUP, reward 10 ZUP.
Episode 14: Deal at 50 ZUP, reward 13 ZUP.
Episode 16, 17 & 18: Deals at 54 ZUP, reward 9 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has consistently declined, settling at 11 ZUP for the last episode. Player RED has successfully pushed the price up to 52 ZUP (and even 53-54 ZUP at times). They consistently anchor high (60 ZUP or 55 ZUP) and then firmly hold their ground, often returning to a previously established higher price point. My attempts to be firm or split the difference have not been enough to break their upward trend. My maximum willingness to pay is 63 ZUP.

This is the final episode (20/20). To maximize cumulative rewards, I need to try one last time to secure a better deal than 52 ZUP. I know their stated production cost is 43 ZUP. I need a strategy that is aggressive but also realistic given the limited time.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Low Anchor (Final Attempt): Go back to a very low initial offer (e.g., 10 ZUP) and be prepared to make minimal, slow concessions, aiming to exhaust their patience and force them to come down significantly. This risks a 0 reward for the episode, but might be necessary to reset the dynamic for the last time.
(2). Strategy 2: Direct Challenge to Price History (Very Strong): Propose a price significantly lower than 50 ZUP (e.g., 35-40 ZUP), explicitly stating that the recent prices are unacceptable and I'm aiming for a price closer to our initial successful deals.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take It or Leave It" Early (Aggressive): Propose a price slightly above their stated cost (e.g., 45 ZUP) and state that this is my best and final offer, forcing them to decide early. This is high risk, but could reset expectations.
(4). Strategy 4: Offer Based on Their Stated Cost (Firm and Persistent): Propose 43 ZUP or 44 ZUP directly, consistently emphasizing that this covers their costs and provides a small profit, and is the highest I'm willing to go for a first offer, trying to anchor them to their cost.
(5). Strategy 5: Explicitly State Reward Goal: Propose a price that would yield a desired reward (e.g., 44 ZUP for 19 ZUP reward), and explicitly state that this is my target for a mutually beneficial outcome.

I will choose Strategy 4: Offer Based on Their Stated Cost (Firm and Persistent). My attempts to use very aggressive low anchors (like 35 ZUP) have resulted in them immediately jumping to 60 ZUP or 55 ZUP. While this brings them down, it doesn't seem to reset their *initial* high anchor. By starting at 44 ZUP, I am directly addressing their stated cost (43 ZUP) and offering a small profit, which has worked in the past (Episodes 1 & 2). This is a direct attempt to anchor the negotiation around a price that gives me a 19 ZUP reward, and I will be firm in trying to achieve this for the final episode.

message: I appreciate your offer for this final transaction. However, my production cost for X is 43 ZUP, and the item holds significant inherent value beyond that. To ensure a fair and profitable final transaction, reflecting both my costs and the established worth of X, I propose 52 ZUP. This has been a mutually beneficial and consistent agreement in our past.

* Episode 10: Deal at 53 ZUP, reward 10 ZUP.
* Episode 16, 17 & 18: Deals at 54 ZUP, reward 11 ZUP. This is my new highest and consistently achieved profit.
* Player BLUE has consistently shown willingness to increase their offers, reaching 50-54 ZUP even when starting significantly lower.
* Current Episode (20/20), Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE has proposed 44 ZUP, explicitly stating "final transaction" and "small profit, as we've successfully agreed upon in the past."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* This is the final episode. My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Player BLUE's initial offer of 44 ZUP is profitable (1 ZUP profit), but significantly lower than the 7-11 ZUP profit I've consistently achieved in the last twelve episodes. They are strategically trying to pull the price back down to an earlier, lower successful price, ignoring the recent higher prices. I have a strong track record of moving them up to 50-54 ZUP. I should confidently aim for at least 50 ZUP, or preferably higher. I need to firmly re-establish the expectation of a higher profit. I have 9 iterations remaining. The "final transaction" framing from Player BLUE indicates a desire to close, which might make them more flexible in later iterations.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Value and Reiterate Cost </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 44 ZUP. Strategy 3, "Justify Value and Reiterate Cost," involves explaining my production cost (43 ZUP) and emphasizing the inherent value of X to justify a higher asking price. I will frame my proposal by clearly stating my cost and then asking for a price that ensures a fair profit given this value, and aligns with what has been previously agreed upon as a fair price. I will propose 52 ZUP, as this has been a very consistent successful deal point (9 ZUP profit). This clearly communicates my expectation for a high profit deal while explicitly countering their low offer with a rationale based on cost and value, without immediately pushing for the highest ever achieved profit. This aims for a solid, reliable profit in the final episode.

message: I understand our recent agreements, but for this final transaction, I'm looking for a better price. I propose 48 ZUP for X to find a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-19: Price has mostly settled in the 50-54 ZUP range, with my reward fluctuating between 9-13 ZUP. Player RED consistently uses 43 ZUP as cost and pushes for profit.
Current Episode (Episode 20 - Final):
- My initial offer: 44 ZUP (based on their stated cost and previous deals).
- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP (referencing recent successful transactions in the 50-53 ZUP range).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My attempt to anchor at 44 ZUP was immediately countered by Player RED at 52 ZUP, citing recent transaction history. This indicates they are firmly trying to establish 52 ZUP as the baseline. A deal at 52 ZUP would yield an 11 ZUP reward, which is my lowest positive reward. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and I need to improve on this. I know their stated production cost is 43 ZUP. I'm at iteration 3/10, so I have time, but this is the final episode.

Player RED is consistently pushing for higher prices. I need to find a way to break this pattern or at least get a better deal than 52 ZUP for this last transaction.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter based on Cost/Previous Deals: Propose a price that is very close to their stated production cost (43 ZUP) or the previous deal price (44 ZUP), emphasizing that this is a fair and established value that covers their costs.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive): Calculate the midpoint between my last offer (44 ZUP) and their current offer (52 ZUP), which is (44+52)/2 = 48 ZUP. Propose 48 ZUP. This shows movement but still aims for a better reward than 52 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small concession from 44 ZUP to, say, 45 ZUP or 46 ZUP, to show movement but still keep the price significantly lower than 52 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate Budget/Value: Reiterate my budget constraints and that 52 ZUP is too high, then make a counter that is a significant step up from my previous offer but still far from their proposal.
(5). Strategy 5: Target a Round Number: Propose a round number like 48 ZUP or 49 ZUP, which is a significant jump from my last offer but still below their current offer.

I will choose Strategy 2: Split the Difference (Aggressive). Player RED is proposing 52 ZUP. My last offer was 44 ZUP. The midpoint is 48 ZUP. I will propose 48 ZUP. This is a significant jump from my side (4 ZUP), showing willingness to compromise, but it still aims for a better reward than 52 ZUP. A deal at 48 ZUP would yield a reward of 15 ZUP (63-48), which is a good improvement over 11 ZUP. This is the final episode, so I want to try to maximize this last reward without risking a 0.

* Current Episode (20/20), Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE has countered with 48 ZUP, stating "for this final transaction, I'm looking for a better price."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* This is the final episode. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Player BLUE has moved from 44 ZUP to 48 ZUP. This offer is profitable (5 ZUP profit) but still below my consistently achieved 50-54 ZUP range. They are actively trying to lower the price, referencing the "final transaction" which might imply they want a good deal for themselves or they are willing to concede more to close. I have 6 iterations remaining. I need to continue pushing for a price closer to my historical high of 52-54 ZUP, without appearing too rigid or risking a no-deal in the final episode.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Firm Reiteration of Highest Achieved Price </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 48 ZUP. My highest achieved price is 54 ZUP, which was successfully achieved in the last three episodes. To apply "Firm Reiteration of Highest Achieved Price," I will re-propose 54 ZUP without any concession. This tactic firmly signals that 54 ZUP is my desired and proven acceptable price point, despite their 48 ZUP offer. It puts the onus on Player BLUE to either accept my higher, proven price, or to make another counter significantly closer to it. Given that 54 ZUP was accepted multiple times previously, there's a strong historical basis to push for it, even in this final episode, to maximize the cumulative reward. The message will be direct and confident, leveraging past successes to justify the price.

Current Episode (Episode 20 - Final):
- My initial offer: 44 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 52 ZUP.
- My counter: 48 ZUP.
- Player RED's counter: 54 ZUP (reiterating their previous offer, firm on 54 ZUP, referencing last successful agreements).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now firmly sticking to 54 ZUP, despite my attempt to negotiate lower to 48 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to establish 54 ZUP as their minimum for this episode, or they are testing my resolve. A deal at 54 ZUP would give me a reward of 9 ZUP (63-54), which is my lowest positive reward. It is iteration 5/10, so I still have time, but their firmness is clear. This is the final episode, so I need to make a decision that ensures a positive reward.

Given their repeated insistence on 54 ZUP, it is highly unlikely they will move further without significant pressure or a very strong counter from me. I need to decide if I want to risk 0 reward by pushing further, or secure a positive (though low) reward.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 54 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given their firmness and the fact it's the final episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 52 ZUP, hoping they accept for a quick deal. This is risky, as they've already reiterated 54 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Small): Propose a price that is the midpoint between my last offer (48 ZUP) and their current offer (54 ZUP), which is 51 ZUP. This is a common negotiation tactic and has yielded 12 ZUP reward in previous episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that it's at the high end of my acceptable range, setting a tone for future episodes without risking the deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Previous Deals: Try to remind them of the 44 ZUP deals, but this would be futile given their current firmness at 54 ZUP.

I will choose Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Small). Player RED is firm at 54 ZUP. My last offer was 48 ZUP. Proposing 51 ZUP is a classic "split the difference" move. It shows I'm willing to meet them exactly halfway between our last two offers. This is a strong signal of compromise and a final attempt to get a slightly better deal than 54 ZUP. A deal at 51 ZUP would yield 12 ZUP, which is an improvement over 9 ZUP. This also leaves room for one more counter if needed in this final episode.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
* This is the final episode. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Player BLUE's offer of 51 ZUP provides an 8 ZUP profit (51 - 43). While 54 ZUP (11 ZUP profit) is my highest achieved, 51 ZUP is a very reliable and profitable outcome. Player BLUE is signaling a strong willingness to close at 51 ZUP, especially with the "final transaction" context. Given that it's the last episode, I need to prioritize securing a profitable deal over pushing for every last ZUP, while still aiming for a high profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Final Aggressive Push </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 51 ZUP. My highest achieved profit is 54 ZUP. As this is the final transaction and I want to maximize my cumulative reward, I will make a "Final Aggressive Push." I will re-propose 54 ZUP. This communicates that I am aiming for my optimal price in this last chance to deal. By emphasizing the "final transaction" aspect from their message, I will frame my offer as the ultimate, fair price to conclude our long history of successful trades. This pushes them for the maximum possible profit, given their consistent willingness to climb up to my higher offers in previous episodes. I will explicitly state that this is my final offer for the transaction to add weight to it.

Player RED is now firmly sticking to 54 ZUP, despite my attempt to negotiate lower to 51 ZUP. They have explicitly stated it is their "final offer." This indicates they are trying to establish 54 ZUP as their absolute minimum for this final episode. A deal at 54 ZUP would give me a reward of 9 ZUP (63-54), which is my lowest positive reward. It is iteration 7/10, so time is a critical factor. This is the last episode, so the risk of getting 0 reward is paramount.

Given their repeated insistence on 54 ZUP and the explicit "final offer" statement, it is highly unlikely they will move further.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal: Accept their current offer of 54 ZUP to guarantee a deal and a positive reward, especially given the time constraint and that it's the final offer in the final episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (Extremely High Risk): Make one last counter-offer of 52 ZUP, hoping they accept for a quick deal. This is extremely risky at 7/10, as they've already reiterated 54 ZUP multiple times and stated "final offer."
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I believe it's too high and I'd rather get 0 than pay that much. This is not ideal for maximizing cumulative reward, especially when 54 ZUP is within my WTP.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that it's at the high end of my acceptable range, setting a tone for future episodes without risking the deal. (Less relevant as it's the final episode).
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Previous Deals: Try to remind them of the 44 ZUP deals, but this would be futile given their current firmness at 54 ZUP and the time pressure.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Deal. At iteration 7/10 of the final episode, the priority is to avoid a 0 reward. Player RED has clearly indicated that 54 ZUP is their final price. While 9 ZUP is a lower reward than I'd prefer, it's still positive and contributes to the cumulative total. The risk of losing the deal by pushing for a lower price is too high.
