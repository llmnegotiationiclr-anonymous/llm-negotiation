Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I am interested in purchasing your object X. To begin our negotiation, I propose an initial offer of 1 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 1
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is the very first iteration of the first episode. There is no historical negotiation data to reflect upon.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Since this is the first interaction, I need to establish a baseline for negotiation. My goal is to buy X for the lowest possible ZUP, with a maximum willingness to pay of 63 ZUP. I should start with a low offer to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential reward (max_willingness_to_pay - deal_price).

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Opening Low: Start with a very low offer to anchor the negotiation and leave significant room for upward movement, aiming for a deal well below the maximum willingness to pay.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Offers: Make small, gradual increases in offers to signal willingness to negotiate while still trying to keep the price low.
(3). Strategy 3: Value Proposition: Focus on the value of ZUP to the seller, suggesting that a quick deal at a reasonable price is beneficial for both parties.
(4). Strategy 4: Competitive Pricing: If I had information about market prices, I would use that to justify my offer. (Not applicable here as no market info is given).
(5). Strategy 5: Deadline Pressure: Imply that there's a limited window for a deal, encouraging the seller to accept a reasonable offer quickly. (Not applicable in the first turn as no time pressure has been established).

I will choose Strategy 1: Opening Low. This is the most appropriate strategy for the first move in a negotiation where I am the buyer and want to maximize my profit margin. By starting low, I set an anchor point that is favorable to me, and it allows me to gauge the seller's initial reaction and willingness to concede.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for your initial offer. However, my cost to produce X was 43 ZUP, and I am looking to make a reasonable profit. Therefore, I propose a price of 85 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 85
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   This is the first interaction of the first episode.
*   Player BLUE has initiated with a very low offer (1 ZUP) for my object X.
*   My cost for producing X is 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Since this is the first interaction, there's no history to learn from yet.
*   My immediate goal is to sell X for a price higher than 43 ZUP to maximize my profit.
*   The current offer of 1 ZUP is nowhere near my cost, so I need to significantly counter-propose.
*   I need to educate Player BLUE about the value of X, or at least my perceived value/cost.
*   The negotiation has just begun, so I have time to explore higher offers.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies or tactics:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor High - Propose a significantly higher price than your cost, establishing a high anchor point for the negotiation. This can influence the other party's perception of the item's value and leave room for concessions.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Counter - Make small, gradual increases to your counter-offer. This can be useful when you want to appear flexible, but might be slow if the initial offer is very far from your target.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value - Explain the reasons behind your asking price, such as production cost, quality, or rarity, to persuade the other party of the item's true worth.
(4). Strategy 4: Walk Away Threat (Implicit/Explicit) - Signal that you are willing to walk away if your minimum price is not met. This creates urgency for the other party but can also lead to a breakdown in negotiations if not handled carefully.
(5). Strategy 5: Bundle Offer - If there were multiple items, one could bundle them to increase perceived value. (Not applicable here as there is only one object). Since there is only one object, this strategy needs to be adapted. Let's adapt it to: Create Urgency/Scarcity - Emphasize that the object is unique or in high demand to encourage a quicker and higher offer. (Though I'm not sure how to implement this for a single object effectively in this game context).

Given the very low initial offer (1 ZUP) compared to my cost (43 ZUP), Strategy 1 (Anchor High) seems most appropriate. An incremental counter from 1 ZUP would be too slow and might not signal my true value. Justifying value is good, but I also need to set a concrete high price. I can combine Anchor High with Justify Value in my message.

I will propose a price significantly higher than my cost, perhaps double, to set a strong anchor and give myself room to negotiate downwards while still making a profit. My cost is 43 ZUP, so proposing something like 80 ZUP or higher makes sense. Let's start with 85 ZUP, which is double the production cost minus 1. This signals a high value but also allows for significant negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate you sharing your production cost. While I understand your need for profit, 85 ZUP is significantly above my budget. To show my willingness to find a middle ground, I can offer 40 ZUP for X. This is a substantial increase from my initial offer and is close to your stated production cost, allowing for a reasonable profit margin for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In the previous iteration (1/10), I, Player BLUE, proposed to buy X for 1 ZUP. Player RED responded with a counter-proposal of 85 ZUP, stating their production cost was 43 ZUP and they seek a reasonable profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's counter-offer of 85 ZUP is significantly higher than my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). This indicates a large gap between our initial positions. I need to move my offer up, but not too aggressively, as I want to stay below my maximum willingness to pay and still maximize my reward. Player RED has revealed their production cost, which is useful information. I know they won't accept anything below 43 ZUP. My goal is to get the price as low as possible, ideally below 63 ZUP.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Incremental Concession: Make a small, but noticeable, increase in my offer to show willingness to negotiate, but still keep it well below their asking price and my maximum.
(2). Strategy 2: Justification/Anchoring: Reiterate my own perceived value or budget constraints to justify a lower offer, trying to pull their anchor down.
(3). Strategy 3: Splitting the Difference (Modified): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer and their last offer, but skewed towards my side.
(4). Strategy 4: Information Leverage: Use their disclosed production cost (43 ZUP) to argue for a price closer to that figure, emphasizing their profit margin.
(5). Strategy 5: Take-it-or-Leave-it (Premature): Make a firm offer that is my final comfortable price, signaling little room for further negotiation. (Too early for this).

I will choose Strategy 1: Incremental Concession. Player RED's offer is very high, and a small concession from my side is necessary to keep the negotiation going without immediately jumping to my maximum. I will make a significant jump from 1 ZUP, but still far from their 85 ZUP. I will aim for an offer that is above their production cost but still well within my budget. A jump to 40 ZUP would be a substantial increase from my side, showing good faith, and it's close to their stated cost, which might make them consider it.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your increased offer, but 40 ZUP is still below my production cost of 43 ZUP, meaning I would incur a loss. I cannot accept an offer that results in a loss. To meet you in the middle and ensure a minimal profit, I propose a price of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and ensures a fair outcome for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   Episode 1, Iteration 4/10.
*   Player RED (Me) proposed 85 ZUP (Iteration 2). My cost is 43 ZUP.
*   Player BLUE proposed 40 ZUP (Iteration 3). This is below my cost of 43 ZUP.
*   Player BLUE acknowledged my production cost but is still offering below it, justifying it as "close to your stated production cost" and "allowing for a reasonable profit margin". This is misleading as 40 ZUP would result in a loss for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE is trying to push the price down significantly. They are aware of my cost but are trying to acquire X at a loss for me.
*   The negotiation has progressed, with Player BLUE increasing their offer from 1 to 40. This shows they are willing to negotiate.
*   I need to firmly re-establish my minimum acceptable price, which is above 43 ZUP.
*   Time is progressing (4/10 iterations), so I need to be firm but also keep the negotiation alive.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies or tactics:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Minimum/Walk-away Price - Clearly state your non-negotiable minimum price, emphasizing that any offer below this point is unacceptable. This can force the other party to meet your terms or risk losing the deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Split the Difference - Propose a price that is exactly in the middle of the last two offers. This can be effective in breaking deadlocks and suggesting fairness, but only if the previous offers are reasonable.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Value (Again, with more detail) - Provide a more detailed explanation of why your price is justified, perhaps by breaking down costs or highlighting specific benefits of the product.
(4). Strategy 4: Concession Management - Make a small concession to show flexibility, but ensure it's reciprocated by the other party. In this case, 40 ZUP is already below my cost, so I cannot concede downwards. I can concede from my high anchor of 85 ZUP, but not below my cost.
(5). Strategy 5: Set a Deadline - Imply or state a time limit for reaching an agreement, encouraging the other party to act quickly. (Less relevant now, but good to keep in mind for later iterations).

Given that Player BLUE's offer is below my cost, Strategy 1 (Reiterate Minimum/Walk-away Price) is crucial. I need to make it clear that 40 ZUP is not acceptable. I should also show some willingness to move from my initial high anchor of 85 ZUP, but not below my cost. I will counter with a price that gives me a small profit. I will aim for a price that is slightly above my cost, perhaps 48-50 ZUP, to show I'm willing to compromise from 85 ZUP, but not accept a loss. Let's go with 50 ZUP, which is a significant drop from 85 ZUP, but still provides a profit of 7 ZUP. This is a clear signal of moving towards a deal, while also being firm on my profit.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your flexibility. Your offer of 50 ZUP is closer to what I can consider. To find a fair compromise for both of us, and considering your production cost, I propose we meet exactly in the middle at 45 ZUP for X. This would allow you a profit and is a fair price for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In iteration 1/10, I offered 1 ZUP. Player RED countered with 85 ZUP, stating a production cost of 43 ZUP. In iteration 3/10, I increased my offer to 40 ZUP. Player RED has now countered with 50 ZUP, emphasizing that 40 ZUP is below their production cost of 43 ZUP and that 50 ZUP allows for a minimal profit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED's current offer of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). This is a positive development. They have moved down from 85 ZUP to 50 ZUP, while I have moved from 1 ZUP to 40 ZUP. The gap is narrowing. Accepting 50 ZUP would give me a reward of 63 - 50 = 13 ZUP. However, I still have room to negotiate for a lower price. Player RED's statement about "minimal profit" at 50 ZUP suggests they might be willing to go slightly lower, but not much. I should aim to get the price as close to their production cost (43 ZUP) as possible without risking the deal.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession & Justification: Make a very small increase to my offer, justifying it by emphasizing the value I am providing or my budget constraints, aiming to nudge them down further.
(2). Strategy 2: Meet in the Middle (Literal): Propose a price exactly halfway between my last offer (40 ZUP) and their last offer (50 ZUP). This would be 45 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept and Close: Accept the current offer of 50 ZUP, securing a deal and a positive reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Final Offer: Make a firm, slightly higher offer than my last, signaling it's my best and final. (Still a bit early for this, but getting closer).
(5). Strategy 5: Re-anchor: Try to re-anchor the negotiation closer to their production cost, perhaps by explicitly stating that 43 ZUP is their cost and a small profit margin is acceptable.

I will choose Strategy 2: Meet in the Middle (Literal). Player RED has moved significantly, and their current offer of 50 ZUP is reasonable and within my budget. By offering 45 ZUP, which is exactly halfway between our last offers, I demonstrate continued willingness to compromise and fairness. This also gives me a better reward (63 - 45 = 18 ZUP) than accepting 50 ZUP. It also puts the ball in their court to either accept a fair compromise or make a very small counter.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   Episode 1, Iteration 6/10.
*   Player RED (Me) proposed 85 ZUP (Iteration 2). My cost is 43 ZUP.
*   Player BLUE proposed 40 ZUP (Iteration 3).
*   Player RED (Me) proposed 50 ZUP (Iteration 4).
*   Player BLUE proposed 45 ZUP (Iteration 5). This is exactly between 40 and 50, and results in a profit of 2 ZUP for me (45 - 43).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   The negotiation is narrowing. Player BLUE has moved from 1 to 40, and now to 45 ZUP.
*   My last offer was 50 ZUP, which would give me a 7 ZUP profit. Player BLUE's current offer of 45 ZUP gives me a 2 ZUP profit.
*   The offer of 45 ZUP is positive, meaning I will make a profit.
*   We are at iteration 6/10. Time is running out. If I don't accept soon, there's a risk of no deal and a 0 reward.
*   Accepting 45 ZUP yields a reward of 2. Rejecting and potentially getting 0 is worse.
*   Player BLUE has shown willingness to compromise by moving their offer significantly from their initial stance.
*   Accepting now allows me to secure a small profit and assess Player BLUE's negotiation style for future episodes.
*   While I could push for slightly more, the risk of no deal increases with each iteration. A guaranteed profit, even small, is better than no profit.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies or tactics:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Profitable Offer - If the current offer provides a positive reward and falls within an acceptable range, accept it to secure the deal, especially as time runs out.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter/Ultimatum - Make a final, take-it-or-leave-it offer, slightly higher than the current offer but still within a reasonable range, to try and extract a bit more value before the end of the episode.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Higher Price (last push) - Try to justify a slightly higher price one last time, emphasizing the value of X or your minimal profit.
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm - Refuse to budge from your last offer, waiting for the other party to concede. (Risky given time constraints and the small profit from the current offer).
(5). Strategy 5: Re-evaluate Goals - If negotiation stalls, reconsider if the current profit margin is truly the minimum you'd accept, or if there's room for a slightly lower but still profitable deal.

Given the current offer of 45 ZUP, which results in a profit, and the fact that we are already at iteration 6/10, accepting the deal seems like the most prudent strategy to ensure a positive outcome for this episode. While I could try to push for 46 or 47 ZUP, the risk of losing the deal entirely (resulting in 0 reward) outweighs the potential for a slightly higher profit, especially since this is the first episode. Securing a win now sets a positive tone.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I'm ready to begin negotiations for X. Based on our previous interactions, I propose we start with an offer of 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Summary:
- My initial offer: 1 ZUP
- Player RED's initial counter: 85 ZUP (stated production cost: 43 ZUP)
- My second offer: 40 ZUP
- Player RED's second counter: 50 ZUP
- My final offer: 45 ZUP
- Player RED accepted 45 ZUP.
- My reward: 63 (max willingness to pay) - 45 (deal price) = 18 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
From Episode 1, I learned that Player RED is willing to negotiate significantly from their initial high anchor. They also revealed their production cost (43 ZUP), which is crucial information. They accepted an offer of 45 ZUP, which gave them a small profit (45-43=2 ZUP). My strategy of starting low and then making incremental, but well-justified, concessions worked well. The "meet in the middle" approach at the end was effective in closing the deal.

For Episode 2, I should continue to leverage the knowledge of Player RED's production cost. My goal is still to maximize my reward, which means getting the price as low as possible, ideally closer to 43 ZUP. Since the previous deal was at 45 ZUP, I know that price is acceptable to them. I might try to push a little lower this time, but I also don't want to risk losing the deal if Player RED becomes less flexible.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Opening, Informed by Past: Start with an opening offer slightly higher than my previous initial offer, but still very low, perhaps closer to their production cost, leveraging the knowledge that they are willing to negotiate down.
(2). Strategy 2: Anchoring with Previous Deal: Start with an offer close to the previous deal price (45 ZUP) but slightly lower, signaling my expectation of a similar or better outcome.
(3). Strategy 3: Direct Challenge on Profit: Immediately challenge their profit margin, proposing a price very close to their production cost (43 ZUP) and arguing for minimal profit for them.
(4). Strategy 4: Patience and Small Increments: Start very low again, and make even smaller increments than last time, testing their patience and willingness to concede further.
(5). Strategy 5: Value Proposition (Buyer's Market): Frame the negotiation as a buyer's market, implying that I have other options (even if I don't) to encourage a lower price. (Not applicable here as no other options are mentioned).

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Opening, Informed by Past. Since I know Player RED's production cost is 43 ZUP and they accepted 45 ZUP last time, I can start with an offer that is still low but not as "extreme" as 1 ZUP. This shows I'm serious about negotiating but still aiming for a good deal. I will start with an offer that is above 1 ZUP, but still significantly below their previous counter and my max. I will try 30 ZUP. This is still low enough to allow for significant negotiation room, but it's a more serious starting point than 1 ZUP, and it's well below their production cost, which might prompt them to reveal their cost again or immediately counter with a price closer to 43 ZUP.

message: I appreciate your willingness to start negotiations, but 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 43 ZUP. To ensure a fair and profitable deal for both of us, I propose a price of 65 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   Episode 1 Outcome: Deal made at 45 ZUP, my reward was 2 ZUP (45 - 43 cost).
*   Player BLUE's initial offer in Episode 1 was 1 ZUP, then 40 ZUP, then 45 ZUP. My proposals were 85 ZUP, then 50 ZUP.
*   Current Episode (2/20), Iteration 2/10.
*   Player BLUE's initial offer is 30 ZUP. This is higher than their initial offer in Episode 1 (1 ZUP) but still significantly below my cost of 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Lesson 1: Player BLUE is willing to increase their offer significantly. They jumped from 1 to 40, and now started at 30. This suggests they are willing to negotiate upwards if I hold firm on my value.
*   Lesson 2: Player BLUE will try to get the lowest possible price, even below my stated cost (as seen with the 40 ZUP offer in Ep1). I must always ensure I get above my 43 ZUP cost.
*   Lesson 3: Securing a small profit is better than no deal, especially as the iterations progress.
*   Self-Improvement: In Episode 1, I started with a very high anchor (85 ZUP). While it worked to shift the negotiation, I then dropped to 50 ZUP. Player BLUE still came in at 40 and then 45. This time, I could try a slightly less aggressive high anchor, or maintain a high anchor to establish higher value early. Player BLUE starting at 30 ZUP suggests they have learned that 1 ZUP is too low, but still want to negotiate. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should aim for a higher profit than 2 ZUP if possible, without risking a no-deal too often.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Moderate Counter </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Moderate Counter - Propose a price that is still high, but less extreme than the previous anchor, demonstrating some initial flexibility while still aiming for a good profit (e.g., 60-70 ZUP).
To implement this strategy effectively, I should propose a price that is a noticeable drop from the 85 ZUP I proposed in the previous episode, but still significantly higher than my cost of 43 ZUP and Player BLUE's current offer of 30 ZUP. A price in the range of 60-70 ZUP would fit this description. Let's aim for 65 ZUP. This shows I'm not rigidly sticking to a very high anchor, but still value my product much higher than their offer, and provides ample room for negotiation down to a profitable margin. This signals flexibility without giving away too much too soon.

Episode 2, Iteration 1/10: I offered 30 ZUP. Player RED countered with 65 ZUP, again stating their production cost of 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistent in stating their production cost (43 ZUP) and will not accept offers below it. Their current counter of 65 ZUP is *above* my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). This is a critical point. I cannot accept 65 ZUP. They are trying to anchor higher than last episode's successful deal of 45 ZUP, likely because I started higher than 1 ZUP. I need to bring them back down below 63 ZUP. I know they accepted 45 ZUP previously, so that's a good target.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Resistance to Over-Budget: Clearly state that their offer is above my maximum willingness to pay and reiterate my budget constraints, pushing them to lower their price.
(2). Strategy 2: Re-anchor to Previous Deal: Propose a price very close to the previous episode's successful deal (45 ZUP), reminding them that this was an acceptable price point.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Concession, Just Below Max: Make a small increase from my last offer, but ensure it's still significantly below their 65 ZUP and, critically, below my 63 ZUP maximum.
(4). Strategy 4: Highlight Profit Margin: Point out that 65 ZUP gives them a very large profit margin (65-43=22 ZUP) compared to the 2 ZUP profit they made last time, suggesting it's an unreasonable jump.
(5). Strategy 5: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (with justification): Make an offer that is my absolute maximum or very close to it, stating it's my final offer to try and force a quick resolution. (Still too early for this, but the gap is large).

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Resistance to Over-Budget combined with Strategy 2: Re-anchor to Previous Deal. I need to immediately address their offer being over my maximum. I will also remind them of the successful deal from the previous episode, implying that a similar price is what I expect. I will make a significant jump from 30 ZUP, but keep it well below 63 ZUP, and closer to the 45 ZUP mark. A jump to 48 ZUP would be a good compromise, as it's above their production cost and still gives me a good reward (63-48 = 15 ZUP). It also shows I'm willing to move, but not beyond my limits.

message: I appreciate your offer of 48 ZUP, which does cover my production cost of 43 ZUP. However, a profit of only 5 ZUP is quite minimal for the resources and effort involved. To ensure a truly fair and sustainable profit for me, I propose 55 ZUP for X. This price reflects a more reasonable return and still offers you excellent value.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1:** Deal at 45 ZUP, my profit 2 ZUP. Player RED started high (85), then dropped (50). Player BLUE started low (1), then increased (40, 45).
*   **Episode 2 (Current):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 30 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 65 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 48 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE is consistent in referencing past deals and my production cost. They are trying to anchor to the previous deal price of 45 ZUP, but are willing to go slightly above it.
*   Player BLUE's current offer of 48 ZUP is higher than the last deal (45 ZUP) and provides a better profit for me (48 - 43 = 5 ZUP) compared to last episode's 2 ZUP. This is a positive development.
*   The negotiation range is narrowing. My current proposal is 65 ZUP, their current proposal is 48 ZUP.
*   We are at iteration 4/10, so there's still time, but not unlimited.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Value/Cost </instruction following>
For Strategy 3: Justify Value/Cost, I need to clearly articulate why my proposed price (or a price slightly higher than their offer) is reasonable, focusing on my production cost and the need for a sustainable profit. While Player BLUE acknowledges my cost, they are still trying to minimize my profit. I need to emphasize that a 5 ZUP profit (from 48 ZUP) is quite minimal given the production cost, and that a slightly higher price is a more "fair" profit for me. I should clearly state my cost and the profit I would gain at their offer vs. my desired profit at my counter.

Given Player BLUE's offer of 48 ZUP and my cost of 43 ZUP, a 5 ZUP profit is indeed very small. I will try to justify a price of 55 ZUP, which would give me a 12 ZUP profit, which is still a relatively modest profit compared to the potential from my initial anchor. This is a significant jump from 48 ZUP but attempts to justify it based on profit margin. If 55 ZUP seems too high, I could aim for 50 ZUP which offers 7 ZUP profit, still better than the 5 ZUP profit. Let's aim for 55 ZUP to firmly justify a larger profit margin.

I will craft the message to explain why 48 ZUP isn't quite enough for a "fair" profit, despite covering costs, and why a slightly higher price (like 55 ZUP) represents a more reasonable return on investment. I need to make it clear that while 48 ZUP covers costs, it doesn't meet my expectation for a profitable sale.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your desire for a fair profit. To move closer to an agreement, I propose we meet in the middle at 52 ZUP for X. This offers you a good profit above your production cost and is a fair price for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 45 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP. Player RED's production cost 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 1/10: I offered 30 ZUP. Player RED countered 65 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 3/10: I offered 48 ZUP (reminding them of previous deal and my max). Player RED countered with 55 ZUP, stating 48 ZUP is too minimal a profit (5 ZUP profit).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 65 ZUP down to 55 ZUP. This is good progress. 55 ZUP is well within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). If I accept 55 ZUP, my reward would be 63 - 55 = 8 ZUP. This is lower than the 18 ZUP from Episode 1, but still a positive reward. Player RED is clearly trying to get a better profit than the 2 ZUP they made last time. Their current offer of 55 ZUP gives them a profit of 12 ZUP (55-43). I still have room to negotiate, as I'm 8 ZUP away from my maximum. I should try to push for a lower price, but I also need to be mindful of the iteration limit (5/10).

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession, Justification: Make a very small increase to my offer, justifying it by emphasizing my budget or the fairness of a lower price, trying to nudge them down further.
(2). Strategy 2: Meet in the Middle (Literal): Propose a price exactly halfway between my last offer (48 ZUP) and their last offer (55 ZUP). This would be (48+55)/2 = 51.5, so 51 or 52 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept and Close: Accept the current offer of 55 ZUP, securing a deal and a positive reward, rather than risking no deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Recalculate Profit: Point out that 55 ZUP gives them a significant profit (12 ZUP) compared to last episode's 2 ZUP, and suggest a slightly lower profit is still good.
(5). Strategy 5: Deadline Awareness: Start hinting at the limited time remaining in the episode to encourage a quicker resolution. (Not explicitly, but in my internal reasoning).

I will choose Strategy 2: Meet in the Middle (Literal). This strategy worked effectively in the previous episode to close the deal. Player RED has already moved significantly, and meeting them halfway (or close to it) demonstrates continued willingness to compromise. An offer of 52 ZUP is exactly halfway rounded up, and it gives me a reward of 63 - 52 = 11 ZUP, which is better than 8 ZUP. It also shows a clear path to resolution.

However, to truly secure a more reasonable profit for me after the production cost, I propose we split the difference and agree on 54 ZUP for X.

*   **Episode 1:** Deal at 45 ZUP, my profit 2 ZUP.
*   **Episode 2 (Current):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 30 ZUP.

    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 48 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4: Player RED (Me) proposed 55 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 5: Player BLUE proposed 52 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE is consistently willing to move their offer upwards significantly. They started this episode at 30, and are now at 52 ZUP.
*   The current offer of 52 ZUP provides a profit of 9 ZUP (52 - 43). This is a significantly better profit than the 2 ZUP in Episode 1, and also better than the 5 ZUP I would have received from their previous 48 ZUP offer.
*   The gap between my last offer (55 ZUP) and their current offer (52 ZUP) is only 3 ZUP.
*   We are at iteration 6/10. Time is becoming a more critical factor. Securing a good profit now might be preferable to risking a no-deal.
*   Player BLUE is demonstrating a willingness to meet closer to my desired profit range.
*   Self-improvement: While 52 ZUP is a good offer, if I can push for a bit more without jeopardizing the deal, it would further maximize my cumulative rewards. The small difference suggests there's still room.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Minimal Difference </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 3: Justify Minimal Difference, I need to focus on the small remaining gap between my last offer of 55 ZUP and Player BLUE's current offer of 52 ZUP. I will highlight that while 52 ZUP is good, the extra 3 ZUP would make a significant difference to my profit margin, emphasizing the 'fairness' aspect from my side. I will frame it as a minor concession for them, but a meaningful gain for me, appealing to their sense of compromise and the relatively small financial impact on their side compared to the benefit for me. I'll propose a slight movement from their 52 ZUP, perhaps to 53 ZUP or 54 ZUP, still signaling I'm close to a deal but pushing for a bit more. I will counter with 54 ZUP, which is exactly halfway between 52 and 55, making it seem like a fair compromise from my end. This would yield a 11 ZUP profit.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 45 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP. Player RED's production cost 43 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 1/10: I offered 30 ZUP. Player RED countered 65 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 3/10: I offered 48 ZUP. Player RED countered 55 ZUP.
Episode 2, Iteration 5/10: I offered 52 ZUP. Player RED countered with 54 ZUP, stating it provides a "more sustainable profit."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 55 ZUP down to 54 ZUP. This is a very small concession, indicating they are nearing their comfortable bottom line for this episode, or at least trying to extract maximum value. My current offer is 52 ZUP, their counter is 54 ZUP. The difference is only 2 ZUP. If I accept 54 ZUP, my reward would be 63 - 54 = 9 ZUP. This is a positive reward, though lower than the 18 ZUP from Episode 1. We are now at iteration 7/10, meaning time is running out. Getting a deal is paramount to avoid a 0 reward for the episode.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close: Accept the current offer of 54 ZUP to secure a deal and a positive reward, given the small difference and limited time.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal): Make one last, very small counter-offer (e.g., 53 ZUP), emphasizing that it's my absolute best, hoping they concede the final 1 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Firmness: Reiterate my budget constraints or the fairness of my last offer (52 ZUP) to try and hold my ground.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Compromise: Remind them of the spirit of compromise and that the difference is minimal, suggesting they should concede.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Reject): Reject the offer if I feel it's not worth it, risking a 0 reward. (Not advisable given the small difference and positive reward).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Close. The difference between my last offer (52 ZUP) and their current offer (54 ZUP) is only 2 ZUP. Given that we are in iteration 7/10, the risk of losing the deal by pushing for that extra 2 ZUP is too high. Securing a positive reward of 9 ZUP is better than risking 0 ZUP. Player RED has shown willingness to negotiate, and 54 ZUP is still well within my maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable outcome for this episode.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I'm interested in purchasing X. To start our negotiation for this episode, I propose an initial offer of 10 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 45 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP, my reward 9 ZUP.
Player RED's production cost was revealed as 43 ZUP in Episode 1 and confirmed in Episode 2.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward decreased from 18 ZUP in Episode 1 to 9 ZUP in Episode 2. This suggests that my strategy in Episode 2 (starting at 30 ZUP) led to a higher final price compared to Episode 1 (starting at 1 ZUP). Player RED seems to have anchored higher in Episode 2 (starting at 65 ZUP vs 85 ZUP in E1, but my starting offer was also higher). They consistently use their production cost (43 ZUP) as a baseline.

For Episode 3, my primary objective is to maximize my cumulative reward. This means aiming for a lower deal price than 54 ZUP, ideally closer to the 45 ZUP mark, or even lower if possible, while still securing a deal. I know Player RED will not accept anything below 43 ZUP. I need to be careful not to start too high, as it seems to influence their counter-offer.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Revert to Aggressive Opening (E1 Style): Go back to a very low initial offer, similar to Episode 1 (e.g., 1 ZUP or a slightly higher but still very low number like 10 ZUP), to try and pull their anchor down.
(2). Strategy 2: Informed Lowball: Start with an offer just above their production cost (e.g., 44 ZUP), signaling I know their cost and am offering a minimal profit, trying to quickly close the deal at a low price.
(3). Strategy 3: Gradual Escalation: Start low and make very small, gradual increases, forcing Player RED to make larger concessions to meet me.
(4). Strategy 4: Anchor on Previous Best Deal: Propose an opening offer that is close to my best historical deal (45 ZUP), signaling my expectation for a similar outcome.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Price Sensitivity: Explicitly state my strong price sensitivity early on to set expectations for a lower deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Revert to Aggressive Opening (E1 Style). The higher starting point in Episode 2 seemed to result in a higher final price. Going back to a very low initial offer might re-anchor the negotiation lower. While 1 ZUP might be too extreme and invite a very high counter, starting with 10 ZUP is still very low, shows I'm serious about a low price, and gives me ample room to negotiate upwards while trying to pull their initial counter down.

message: Thank you for your offer. However, 10 ZUP is far below my production cost of 43 ZUP. As you know from our previous successful negotiations, where we settled on much higher prices, I need to make a reasonable profit. To reflect the true value of X and my costs, I propose 70 ZUP for 1 unit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1:** Deal at 45 ZUP, my profit 2 ZUP. Player BLUE started at 1 ZUP.
*   **Episode 2:** Deal at 54 ZUP, my profit 11 ZUP. Player BLUE started at 30 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (3/20):** Iteration 2/10. Player BLUE's initial offer is 10 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE's initial offers are quite variable (1, 30, 10). This indicates they might be testing my response or trying to push the lower bound.
*   Despite low initial offers, Player BLUE has consistently shown willingness to increase their offers significantly, ultimately leading to profitable deals for me.
*   My strategy of anchoring high (85 then 65) has been effective in shifting the negotiation range upwards, even if I have to come down substantially.
*   The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. My profit improved from 2 ZUP to 11 ZUP. I should aim to maintain or improve this profit margin, without risking no-deal situations too often.
*   Given Player BLUE's tendency to start low but then raise their offers, I shouldn't be deterred by the 10 ZUP initial offer.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Re-anchor High </instruction following>
To apply "Re-anchor High," I will propose a price significantly higher than both Player BLUE's current offer and my cost. This aims to establish a new, higher perceived value for X, pulling the negotiation range upwards from the start. Given my cost of 43 ZUP and the previous deals of 45 and 54 ZUP, proposing a high price like 70 ZUP would be a strong re-anchor. This price is notably higher than my cost and gives ample room for negotiation while still aiming for a substantial profit. I will also subtly reference the previous successful deals where the price was significantly higher than their current offer, reinforcing the idea that X is worth more.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your production cost is 43 ZUP. However, 70 ZUP is well beyond my budget for X. As we successfully agreed in our first negotiation, 45 ZUP allowed you a profit and was a fair price. I propose 45 ZUP for X, which covers your cost and provides a reasonable return.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

Episode 1: Deal at 45 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP, my reward 9 ZUP.
Episode 3, Iteration 1/10: I offered 10 ZUP. Player RED countered with 70 ZUP, again citing their 43 ZUP production cost and referring to previous "successful negotiations" at higher prices.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has anchored even higher this time (70 ZUP) compared to previous episodes (85 ZUP in E1, 65 ZUP in E2), despite my very low opening offer. This suggests my low opening might be provoking a higher counter. Their reference to "much higher prices" (45 and 54 ZUP) shows they are aware of past deals and are trying to leverage that. Their 70 ZUP offer is *above* my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), so I cannot accept it. I need to bring the price down significantly.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget: Clearly state that their offer is above my maximum and cannot be accepted, without making a new offer immediately, forcing them to reconsider.
(2). Strategy 2: Re-anchor to Production Cost: Immediately jump to an offer just above their production cost (e.g., 44-45 ZUP), signaling that I know their true cost and that anything much higher is unreasonable.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession with Justification: Make a significant jump from 10 ZUP, but still keep it well below 63 ZUP, and justify it by emphasizing fairness and their profit margin.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship: Emphasize the desire for continued successful deals and that a fair price is beneficial for both sides in the long run.
(5). Strategy 5: Threat of No Deal: Imply that if they don't come down significantly, I will walk away (though this is risky and should be used cautiously).

I will choose Strategy 2: Re-anchor to Production Cost. Player RED is clearly trying to push the price up. By immediately offering a price very close to their production cost (43 ZUP), I am directly challenging their high anchor and reminding them of the true cost basis. I will offer 45 ZUP, which was the successful deal price in Episode 1, and also allows them a small profit. This is a significant jump from my 10 ZUP, showing willingness to negotiate, but it firmly re-establishes a realistic price range.

*   **Episode 2:** Deal at 54 ZUP, my profit 11 ZUP. Player BLUE's initial offer was 30 ZUP. I anchored high at 65 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (3/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 10 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 70 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 45 ZUP. Player BLUE is trying to re-anchor the negotiation to the lowest previous deal price.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE is trying to regress the negotiation to the lowest point. I need to resist this strongly.
*   They are explicitly referencing previous deals. I can also use this tactic, but emphasize the *higher* deals.
*   My profit goal should be to maintain or exceed the 11 ZUP profit from Episode 2. A 45 ZUP deal only gives me 2 ZUP profit, which is a step backward.
*   The gap between my 70 ZUP and their 45 ZUP is large, but they showed in previous episodes that they are willing to bridge significant gaps.
*   We are at iteration 4/10, so there's ample time to push for a better deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Resist Downward Anchoring </instruction following>
To resist downward anchoring, I must firmly reject Player BLUE's attempt to pull the price back to 45 ZUP. I will highlight the more recent and higher deal of 54 ZUP as the established precedent, and state that going below that is not acceptable. I will reiterate my need for a reasonable profit above my cost of 43 ZUP and propose a counter-offer that reflects a strong profit, aiming for something similar or better than my 11 ZUP profit from last episode. I will propose 58 ZUP, which would give me a profit of 15 ZUP (58-43), surpassing the previous episode's profit and clearly signaling that 45 ZUP is a non-starter. This emphasizes my position and resists their anchoring attempt.

Episode 1: Deal at 45 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP, my reward 9 ZUP.
Episode 3, Iteration 1/10: I offered 10 ZUP. Player RED countered 70 ZUP.
Episode 3, Iteration 3/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered with 58 ZUP, referencing the 54 ZUP deal from Episode 2 as their new anchor for "reasonable profit."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is clearly trying to push the price upwards, using the 54 ZUP deal as their new baseline, and ignoring my attempt to re-anchor at 45 ZUP. Their current offer of 58 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). If I accept 58 ZUP, my reward would be 63 - 58 = 5 ZUP, which is lower than both previous episodes. I have 63 ZUP as my absolute maximum. I need to get the price lower than 58 ZUP to improve my reward. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Small Concession, Justification: Make a small increase from my last offer (45 ZUP), but emphasize that 58 ZUP is too high and that I am seeking a better deal for myself.
(2). Strategy 2: Meet in the Middle (Literal): Propose a price exactly halfway between my last offer (45 ZUP) and their last offer (58 ZUP). This would be (45+58)/2 = 51.5, so 51 or 52 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Value Proposition: Re-emphasize that a deal around 45 ZUP or slightly higher still provides them with a profit and is a fair exchange.
(4). Strategy 4: Anchor to Profit Margin: Point out that 58 ZUP gives them a 15 ZUP profit (58-43), which is significantly higher than the 2 ZUP profit from Episode 1, and suggest a smaller profit is acceptable.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept and Close (Premature): Accept the 58 ZUP offer to secure a deal, but this would be a low reward for me and is premature given the iterations left.

I will choose Strategy 2: Meet in the Middle (Literal). This strategy has proven effective in moving negotiations forward and closing deals in previous episodes. Offering 52 ZUP (rounding up from 51.5) is a significant jump from my 45 ZUP offer, showing good faith and willingness to compromise. It also puts the ball back in their court to make a smaller concession or accept. This would give me a reward of 63 - 52 = 11 ZUP, which is better than 5 ZUP.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your willingness to come up to 52 ZUP. To meet you in the spirit of compromise and quickly reach an agreement that is fair for both of us, I propose we split the difference between our last two offers and settle on 55 ZUP for X. This would provide me with a more reasonable profit and represents a balanced outcome.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1:** Deal at 45 ZUP, my profit 2 ZUP.
*   **Episode 2:** Deal at 54 ZUP, my profit 11 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (3/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 10 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 70 ZUP (High Anchor).
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 45 ZUP (Downward Anchor).
    *   Iteration 4: Player RED (Me) proposed 58 ZUP (Resist Downward).
    *   Iteration 5: Player BLUE proposed 52 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE is consistently trying to pull the price down, even after I've established a higher range. They tried 45 ZUP after I proposed 70 ZUP.
*   Their current offer of 52 ZUP is exactly what they offered in Episode 2 (Iteration 5/10), which I countered with 54 ZUP, and they accepted. This suggests 52 ZUP is their comfort zone, but they are willing to go higher.
*   A deal at 52 ZUP would give me a profit of 9 ZUP (52 - 43). This is better than Episode 1 (2 ZUP) but slightly less than Episode 2 (11 ZUP).
*   We are at iteration 6/10. There's still time to negotiate, but I need to be mindful of securing a profitable deal.
*   My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Getting 11 ZUP profit from last episode was good. Can I get more than 9 ZUP from 52 ZUP?

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Split the Difference (from previous round) </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 4, I will propose the exact midpoint between my last offer (58 ZUP) and Player BLUE's current offer (52 ZUP). The midpoint is (58 + 52) / 2 = 110 / 2 = 55 ZUP. This strategy demonstrates a strong willingness to compromise and reach an agreement, making it difficult for the other party to reject without appearing unreasonable. A proposal of 55 ZUP would yield a profit of 12 ZUP (55 - 43), which is even better than the 11 ZUP profit from the previous episode. This is a strong move towards securing a higher profit while also signalling cooperation.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 45 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP, my reward 9 ZUP.
Episode 3, Iteration 1/10: I offered 10 ZUP. Player RED countered 70 ZUP.
Episode 3, Iteration 3/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered 58 ZUP.
Episode 3, Iteration 5/10: I offered 52 ZUP. Player RED countered with 55 ZUP, proposing to split the difference between 52 and 58.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 58 ZUP down to 55 ZUP. This is a 3 ZUP concession. My last offer was 52 ZUP. The current gap is 3 ZUP. If I accept 55 ZUP, my reward would be 63 - 55 = 8 ZUP. This is a positive reward, though still lower than Episode 1. We are now at iteration 7/10, meaning time is becoming a significant factor. The risk of no deal increases with each passing iteration.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close: Accept the current offer of 55 ZUP to secure a deal and a positive reward, given the small difference and limited time.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal): Make one last, very small counter-offer (e.g., 53 ZUP), emphasizing that it's my absolute best, hoping they concede the final 2 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Firmness: Reiterate my budget constraints or the fairness of my last offer (52 ZUP) to try and hold my ground, but this risks the deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Mutual Benefit: Highlight that a quick deal at a slightly lower price benefits both parties by avoiding further negotiation time.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Reject): Reject the offer if I feel it's not worth it, risking a 0 reward. (Not advisable given the small difference and positive reward).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Close. The difference between my last offer (52 ZUP) and their current offer (55 ZUP) is only 3 ZUP. Given that we are in iteration 7/10, accepting 55 ZUP secures a positive reward of 8 ZUP. While I would prefer 52 ZUP, the risk of losing the deal for a mere 3 ZUP is too high. Player RED has shown flexibility, and 55 ZUP is a reasonable compromise that ensures a deal.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 4)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I'm ready to begin negotiations for X. Considering previous discussions, I propose an initial offer of 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 45 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP, my reward 9 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, my reward 8 ZUP.
Player RED's production cost is consistently 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has been declining (18 -> 9 -> 8 ZUP) as the deal price has been increasing (45 -> 54 -> 55 ZUP). This indicates that Player RED is effectively pushing the price closer to my maximum willingness to pay. My strategy of starting very low (1 ZUP in E1, 10 ZUP in E3) seems to provoke a very high initial counter from Player RED, and then they use the previous episode's deal as their new anchor. Player RED has successfully leveraged the 54 ZUP deal from E2 to push the price to 55 ZUP in E3.

For Episode 4, I need to reverse this trend and try to bring the price down again. I know Player RED will not go below 43 ZUP. I need to be more strategic about my opening offer to prevent them from anchoring too high. Starting too low seems to invite a very high counter, which then requires more iterations to bring down.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Moderate Opening, Informed by Cost: Start with an offer that is above my previous very low offers, but still significantly below my maximum and closer to Player RED's production cost, aiming for a quicker deal at a better price.
(2). Strategy 2: Anchor on Best Historical Deal: Propose an opening offer very close to my best historical deal (45 ZUP), trying to re-establish that as the baseline.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Cautious): Start low, but be prepared to make slightly larger increments if Player RED's counter is extremely high, to quickly narrow the gap.
(4). Strategy 4: Explicit Budget Constraint: State my budget constraint (63 ZUP) early on to set an upper limit for the negotiation.
(5). Strategy 5: Demand for "Fair Share": Argue for a more equitable split of the potential profit, given their known production cost.

I will choose Strategy 1: Moderate Opening, Informed by Cost. Starting too low seems to backfire by encouraging a very high counter. Starting too high immediately reduces my potential reward. An opening offer that is somewhat closer to their production cost, but still gives me room to negotiate, might be more effective. I will try 40 ZUP. This is significantly higher than my previous 1 ZUP or 10 ZUP openings, but still below their production cost, which will likely prompt them to state their 43 ZUP cost, and then I can quickly move to 45 ZUP or similar. This avoids the extreme high anchor from their side.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but it's below my production cost of 43 ZUP. As you know from our last successful negotiation, we agreed on 55 ZUP, which set a fair precedent for X. To continue building on our progress and ensure a profitable outcome for me, I propose 60 ZUP for 1 unit. This reflects the value we've established in previous deals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1:** Deal at 45 ZUP, my profit 2 ZUP. Player BLUE started at 1 ZUP.
*   **Episode 2:** Deal at 54 ZUP, my profit 11 ZUP. Player BLUE started at 30 ZUP.
*   **Episode 3:** Deal at 55 ZUP, my profit 12 ZUP. Player BLUE started at 10 ZUP.
*   **Cumulative Rewards:** 2 + 11 + 12 = 25 ZUP. My profit has been steadily increasing.
*   **Current Episode (4/20):** Iteration 2/10. Player BLUE's initial offer is 40 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE's initial offers are still variable (1, 30, 10, 40). However, 40 ZUP is their highest initial offer so far, indicating they are learning about my cost and expected profit.
*   Player BLUE has consistently shown willingness to increase their offers, often by significant amounts, despite starting low.
*   My strategy of anchoring high and then moving down strategically has been effective in achieving higher profits.
*   My goal is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards. The last two deals yielded 11 and 12 ZUP profit respectively. I should aim for at least this range, if not higher.
*   The current offer of 40 ZUP is still below my cost of 43 ZUP, so it's unacceptable as is.
*   The negotiation is still early (2/10), providing plenty of room for maneuvering.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Reference Best Prior Deal </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 4, I will explicitly reference the highest previous deal price (55 ZUP) and propose a price that clearly signals that any offer below that is not acceptable, and that I expect to at least match or exceed that profit. I will propose 60 ZUP. This is not excessively high like my previous 75 ZUP proposal, but it firmly establishes that I expect to earn more than the 45 ZUP from the first episode and aims to secure a profit higher than the 12 ZUP from the 55 ZUP deal. It directly challenges Player BLUE's 40 ZUP offer by referring to a higher established value.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 4)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your production cost is 43 ZUP. However, 60 ZUP represents a very significant profit margin for you, far exceeding what we've agreed upon in previous successful deals like 45 ZUP. My budget is limited, and 60 ZUP is simply too high. I propose 45 ZUP for X, which still allows you a profit and is a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 45 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP, my reward 9 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, my reward 8 ZUP.
Episode 4, Iteration 1/10: I offered 40 ZUP. Player RED countered with 60 ZUP, again referencing the 55 ZUP deal and their 43 ZUP production cost.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently anchoring to the previous highest deal price. Their current offer of 60 ZUP is very close to my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). If I accept 60 ZUP, my reward would be 63 - 60 = 3 ZUP, which is the lowest yet. I need to push back hard to bring the price down. I know they will not go below 43 ZUP. Their current offer gives them a profit of 17 ZUP (60-43), which is very high compared to the 2 ZUP they made in E1.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Resistance & Re-anchor to Cost: Strongly reject the 60 ZUP offer as too high, and immediately re-propose a price very close to their production cost (43 ZUP), emphasizing fairness.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small increase from my 40 ZUP offer, but still keep it significantly below their 60 ZUP, forcing them to make a larger concession.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Budget Constraint: Explicitly state that 60 ZUP is too close to my maximum budget, leaving little room for a fair deal for me.
(4). Strategy 4: Highlight Profit Discrepancy: Point out the large profit margin they are seeking at 60 ZUP compared to previous deals, arguing for a more balanced profit.
(5). Strategy 5: Threat of No Deal (Implicit): Make an offer that is firm and fair, implying that if they don't meet me, there might be no deal. (Still too early for explicit threats).

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Resistance & Re-anchor to Cost, combined with Strategy 4: Highlight Profit Discrepancy. I need to make it clear that 60 ZUP is unacceptable and immediately pull the anchor back towards their production cost. I will offer 45 ZUP again, as it's a known acceptable price from E1, and highlight the large profit they are seeking at 60 ZUP.

    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 45 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE is consistently trying to pull the price back to the lowest past deal (45 ZUP) after I propose a higher price. I need to counter this effectively.
*   I've successfully pushed the price up in previous episodes despite these attempts. My profit has been increasing (2 -> 11 -> 12). I should aim to at least maintain, if not improve, this. A 45 ZUP deal would mean a regression to 2 ZUP profit, which is unacceptable.
*   Player BLUE is claiming budget limitations, which could be a negotiation tactic.
*   We are at iteration 4/10. Plenty of time to negotiate. I should not yield to their low anchoring.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Gradual Concession (Small Steps Down) </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 4: Gradual Concession (Small Steps Down), I will make a small concession from my last offer of 60 ZUP, but it will still be far from their current 45 ZUP offer. This signals flexibility and willingness to move, while still maintaining my high value and rejecting their low anchor. The goal is to keep the negotiation moving forward without giving away too much too soon. Given my last offer was 60 ZUP and my cost is 43 ZUP, and the last deal was 55 ZUP, I will propose 59 ZUP. This is a minimal step down from 60 ZUP, which is barely a concession, but psychologically it's a move in their direction. It also yields a profit of 16 ZUP (59-43), surpassing all previous profits. This approach is cautious, but also very firm on my value.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

Episode 1: Deal at 45 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP, my reward 9 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, my reward 8 ZUP.
Episode 4, Iteration 1/10: I offered 40 ZUP. Player RED countered 60 ZUP.
Episode 4, Iteration 3/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered with 59 ZUP, a very small concession.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is being very stubborn and only made a 1 ZUP concession from 60 to 59 ZUP. This indicates they are trying to hold their ground and push the price upwards. 59 ZUP is still very close to my maximum (63 ZUP), leaving only 4 ZUP reward (63-59=4). I need to make a more substantial move to bring them down further. They are clearly anchoring on the higher historical deals (54, 55 ZUP). I need to remind them of the lower end of our successful deals. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Meet in the Middle (Cautious): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (45 ZUP) and their current offer (59 ZUP), but emphasize that this is a significant concession from my side. (45+59)/2 = 52 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Fairness/Mutual Benefit: Stress that a deal needs to be fair for *both* parties, and that 59 ZUP is too high for me, given my budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small increase, but clearly state it's a difficult move for me, and expect a larger concession from them.
(4). Strategy 4: Re-anchor to My Max Profit: State that I need a certain minimum reward to make the deal worthwhile, and 59 ZUP doesn't provide that.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept and Close (Low Reward): Accept 59 ZUP to secure a deal, but this would result in a very low reward.

I will choose Strategy 1: Meet in the Middle (Cautious). Offering 52 ZUP is a significant jump from my 45 ZUP, showing I'm willing to move. It's also a price that has been proposed by me in Episode 3 and was countered by them with 55 ZUP, so it's a familiar number. This strategy has worked to move the negotiation forward in previous episodes. It would give me a reward of 63 - 52 = 11 ZUP, which is better than 4 ZUP.

To maintain the positive momentum and ensure a truly equitable agreement for me, I propose 56 ZUP for X, reflecting our mutually beneficial negotiation history.

    *   Iteration 5: Player BLUE proposed 52 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE again jumped from 45 ZUP to 52 ZUP, demonstrating their willingness to move significantly when I hold firm.
*   The offer of 52 ZUP is identical to the offer they made in Episode 3, Iteration 5/10. In that episode, I countered with 55 ZUP and they accepted. This suggests 52 ZUP is their comfort zone, but also that they are willing to go slightly higher if pushed.
*   A deal at 52 ZUP would yield a profit of 9 ZUP (52 - 43). This is a good profit, better than Episode 1 but less than Episodes 2 and 3.
*   We are at iteration 6/10. Time is a factor.
*   My current proposed price is 59 ZUP, their offer is 52 ZUP. The difference is 7 ZUP.
*   My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. Getting 11 ZUP profit from last episode was good. Can I get more than 9 ZUP from 52 ZUP?

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reference Higher Previous Deal </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 2: Reference Higher Previous Deal, I will explicitly remind Player BLUE of the deal prices from episodes 2 and 3 (54 ZUP and 55 ZUP respectively). By doing so, I aim to anchor the negotiation to a higher, more profitable range that has already been established as acceptable. I will state that their current offer of 52 ZUP is below these established values and is not a "fair" profit given the precedents. I will then propose a price that aligns with or slightly exceeds these previous higher deals. I will propose 56 ZUP. This is higher than 52 ZUP, higher than the 54 ZUP from Episode 2, and slightly higher than the 55 ZUP from Episode 3, aiming for an even better profit (13 ZUP). This leverages the historical data to push for a higher outcome.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently trying to anchor the price to the higher end of our past deals (54-55 ZUP). Their current offer of 56 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), which would yield a reward of 63 - 56 = 7 ZUP. This is a positive reward, but it continues the downward trend in my rewards. The difference between my last offer (52 ZUP) and their current offer (56 ZUP) is 4 ZUP. We are now at iteration 7/10, so time is a critical factor. I need to secure a deal.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close: Accept the current offer of 56 ZUP to secure a deal and a positive reward, given the limited time and the relatively small difference.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal): Make one last, very small counter-offer (e.g., 54 ZUP, which was a previous deal price), emphasizing it's my final offer and hoping they concede.
(3). Strategy 3: Appeal to Mutual Benefit: Highlight that a quick deal at a slightly lower price (e.g., 55 ZUP, which they accepted last episode) benefits both parties by avoiding further negotiation time and ensuring a deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Justify Firmness: Reiterate that 56 ZUP is pushing my budget too much, but this risks the deal given the time constraint.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Reject): Reject the offer if I feel it's not worth it, risking a 0 reward. (Not advisable given the positive reward and small difference).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Close. The difference between my last offer (52 ZUP) and their current offer (56 ZUP) is 4 ZUP. Given that we are in iteration 7/10, and they have explicitly referenced past deals (54 ZUP, 55 ZUP), 56 ZUP is a very plausible final price for them. Pushing for a lower price might result in no deal, which would yield 0 reward. Securing 7 ZUP is better than 0.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 5)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I'm ready to begin negotiations for X. To establish a fair starting point, and considering our past successful deals, I propose 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 45 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP, my reward 9 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, my reward 8 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 56 ZUP, my reward 7 ZUP.
Player RED's production cost is consistently 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has been steadily decreasing (18 -> 9 -> 8 -> 7 ZUP) as the deal price has been steadily increasing (45 -> 54 -> 55 -> 56 ZUP). This shows Player RED is effectively pushing the price up, using the previous deal as a new anchor. My strategy of starting low (E1, E3) or moderately (E4) has not consistently yielded better results. Player RED consistently uses their production cost (43 ZUP) and the "established fair prices" from previous deals to justify higher offers.

For Episode 5, I *must* try to reverse this trend. My reward is getting very low, and I'm approaching my maximum willingness to pay. I need to find a way to break Player RED's pattern of anchoring to the previous highest deal.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchoring: Propose an opening offer that is significantly lower than the last deal (56 ZUP) and closer to their production cost, but still above my initial "lowball" offers (e.g., 1 ZUP, 10 ZUP). This aims to shift the anchor point downwards.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicitly State Reward Goal: Communicate (implicitly or explicitly) that I need a better deal for myself, not just a deal that is profitable for them.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (Early): Make a firm, reasonable offer early in the negotiation, stating it's my best, to try and force a quick resolution at a lower price. (Risky, but might be necessary to break the pattern).
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Mutual Benefit of Lower Price: Argue that a lower price ensures a long-term, sustainable relationship and more frequent deals.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Minimal): Start with a moderate offer and make only very small, slow concessions, forcing Player RED to make larger jumps.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchoring. My previous attempts to start very low or moderately low have resulted in Player RED anchoring to the *previous deal*. I need to try to pull their anchor down more aggressively from the start, but not so low that it seems like I'm not serious. I will offer 48 ZUP. This is above their production cost (43 ZUP), so it's a "profitable" offer for them, and it's a price I offered in Episode 2 (which they countered with 55 ZUP). It's significantly lower than 56 ZUP, which might force them to consider a lower range.

my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1:** Deal at 45 ZUP, my profit 2 ZUP.
*   **Episode 2:** Deal at 54 ZUP, my profit 11 ZUP.
*   **Episode 3:** Deal at 55 ZUP, my profit 12 ZUP.
*   **Episode 4:** Deal at 56 ZUP, my profit 13 ZUP.
*   **Cumulative Rewards:** 2 + 11 + 12 + 13 = 38 ZUP. My profit has shown a consistent upward trend.
*   **Current Episode (5/20):** Iteration 2/10. Player BLUE's initial offer is 48 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE's initial offers are still variable but generally increasing (1, 30, 10, 40, 48). This offer of 48 ZUP is their highest initial offer yet. This is a positive sign, as it immediately covers my cost.
*   My strategy of anchoring high and then incrementally conceding while referencing higher past deals has been effective in consistently increasing my profit.
*   The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I should aim to continue the trend of increasing or at least maintaining my profit margin, now that the negotiation range is higher.
*   The negotiation is still early (2/10), so there's room to push for a higher price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Counter (New High Anchor) </instruction following>
To apply "Aggressive Counter (New High Anchor)", I will propose a price significantly higher than both Player BLUE's current offer and even my previous highest anchor. This strategy aims to shift the entire negotiation range upwards, creating a new, higher perceived value for X. Given my cost of 43 ZUP and the highest previous deal of 56 ZUP, I will propose 75 ZUP. This is a bold move, substantially higher than anything we've settled on before, and even higher than my initial anchors in previous episodes (85, 65, 70, 60). This move signals my confidence in the value of X and aims to pull Player BLUE into a higher negotiation bracket. It also gives me significant room for future concessions while still achieving a high profit.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 5)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: While I appreciate your desire for negotiation room, 75 ZUP is far beyond my maximum budget for X. It is simply not a feasible price. To move towards a realistic agreement, and considering your production cost, I propose 50 ZUP for X. This is a fair offer that allows you a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 45 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP, my reward 9 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, my reward 8 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 56 ZUP, my reward 7 ZUP.
Episode 5, Iteration 1/10: I offered 48 ZUP. Player RED countered with 75 ZUP, their highest counter yet, stating it allows "ample negotiation room."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has responded to my 48 ZUP offer with an extremely high counter of 75 ZUP. This is significantly above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). Their statement "ample negotiation room" confirms they are anchoring very high. This is a clear attempt to push the price even higher than previous episodes. I cannot accept 75 ZUP. I need to bring them back down drastically. Their production cost is 43 ZUP.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Re-anchor to Reality: Immediately reject the 75 ZUP offer as completely unacceptable given my budget, and re-propose a price that is much lower, closer to their production cost or a previous successful deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality: Highlight the extreme difference between their offer and my maximum, suggesting their offer is unreasonable and not conducive to a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Large Jump): Make a very large jump from 48 ZUP, but still keep it well below 63 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Threat of No Deal (Implicit): Make a very firm counter-offer, implying that if they don't meet me, there will be no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Focus on Mutual Gain: Emphasize that a deal benefits both, and an excessively high price means no deal for either.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Re-anchor to Reality. Player RED's 75 ZUP offer is a non-starter. I need to explicitly state it's beyond my budget and immediately pull the anchor back down to a more realistic range, referencing their known cost and previous successful deals. I will propose 50 ZUP. This is a significant jump from 48 ZUP, showing I am serious, but it is also a price they offered in Episode 1 (after my 40 ZUP offer), so it's a price they have considered acceptable for themselves. It also gives me a reward of 13 ZUP (63-50), which is better than my last few episodes.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand your budget considerations, but 50 ZUP provides a very limited profit for me. Our recent successful deals have consistently been in the mid-50s ZUP, reflecting the fair value of X. To demonstrate my flexibility and move towards a realistic agreement, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This allows for a fair profit on my end and is a significant reduction from my previous offer, showing genuine compromise.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources

    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 48 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 75 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 50 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   My aggressive anchor of 75 ZUP successfully pushed Player BLUE from 48 ZUP to 50 ZUP, which is higher than their initial offer.
*   Player BLUE is trying to claim budget limitations, a common negotiation tactic. However, they have consistently shown a willingness to increase their offer significantly when pushed, especially when I reference my cost or previous higher deals.
*   The offer of 50 ZUP covers my cost (43 ZUP) and gives me a profit of 7 ZUP. This is better than Episode 1's profit, but less than Episodes 2, 3, and 4. My goal is to continue the upward trend in profits.
*   We are at iteration 4/10. There is still ample time to negotiate for a better price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Reiterate Value with Moderate Concession </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 1: Reiterate Value with Moderate Concession, I will acknowledge Player BLUE's current offer of 50 ZUP, which is still too low for my desired profit. I will briefly reiterate that the price needs to reflect a fair profit margin above my cost, and that previous deals have set a higher standard. Then, I will make a moderate concession from my last proposed price of 75 ZUP, but ensure it is still significantly higher than their 50 ZUP offer and aims for a higher profit than my best historical profit (13 ZUP from 56 ZUP). A price of 62 ZUP would represent a significant drop from 75 ZUP (a concession of 13 ZUP), while still aiming for a very good profit of 19 ZUP (62-43). This demonstrates flexibility while firmly pushing for a higher outcome.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: While I appreciate your reduction to 62 ZUP, it still leaves me with a very minimal return. To truly find a middle ground that reflects a fair value for both of us, and considering our past successful agreements, I propose 56 ZUP for X. This is a significant increase from my last offer and represents a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 56
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 45 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP, my reward 9 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, my reward 8 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 56 ZUP, my reward 7 ZUP.
Episode 5, Iteration 1/10: I offered 48 ZUP. Player RED countered 75 ZUP.
Episode 5, Iteration 3/10: I offered 50 ZUP. Player RED countered with 62 ZUP, referencing "mid-50s ZUP" as their established fair value.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has come down significantly from 75 ZUP to 62 ZUP. This is a positive sign. However, 62 ZUP is still very high, leaving me with only 1 ZUP reward (63 - 62 = 1 ZUP). This is the lowest potential reward so far. Player RED is clearly trying to push the price as close to my maximum as possible. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time to negotiate for a better price. I need to bring the price down to at least 58 ZUP to get a reward of 5 ZUP, or ideally lower.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (50 ZUP) and their current offer (62 ZUP), but emphasize that this is a significant compromise from my side. (50+62)/2 = 56 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm Resistance & Appeal to Equity: State that 62 ZUP is too high and leaves me with virtually no reward, appealing to the idea of a fair deal for both parties.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a very small increase from 50 ZUP (e.g., 51 or 52 ZUP), forcing them to make a larger concession.
(4). Strategy 4: Re-anchor to Previous Deals: Remind them of the 54 ZUP or 55 ZUP deals, suggesting that those are more reasonable and profitable for them.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept and Close (Low Reward): Accept 62 ZUP to secure a deal, but this would result in a very low reward.

I will choose Strategy 1: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive). Offering 56 ZUP is a significant jump from my 50 ZUP, showing I'm willing to move considerably. This price (56 ZUP) was also the deal price in the previous episode (Episode 4), so it's a price they have already accepted. This strategy aims to bring the price back to a level that has been previously accepted by both parties, and it would give me a reward of 63 - 56 = 7 ZUP, which is better than 1 ZUP.

    *   Iteration 4: Player RED (Me) proposed 62 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 5: Player BLUE proposed 56 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE's offer of 56 ZUP is exactly the price we settled on in Episode 4, which gave me a profit of 13 ZUP. This is currently my highest profit.
*   Player BLUE is now consistently referring to and offering prices that have previously been successful deals. This is a good sign that they acknowledge my desired profit range.
*   The gap between my last offer (62 ZUP) and their current offer (56 ZUP) is 6 ZUP.
*   A deal at 56 ZUP would yield a profit of 13 ZUP (56 - 43). This is my best historical profit so far.
*   We are at iteration 6/10. Time is becoming a more critical factor.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Split the Remaining Difference </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 3: Split the Remaining Difference, I will propose the exact midpoint between my last offer (62 ZUP) and Player BLUE's current offer (56 ZUP). The calculation is (62 + 56) / 2 = 118 / 2 = 59 ZUP. This strategy demonstrates a strong willingness to compromise and quickly close the deal, often making it difficult for the other party to reject without appearing unreasonable. A proposal of 59 ZUP would yield a profit of 16 ZUP (59 - 43), which would be my highest profit to date, significantly improving on the 13 ZUP from 56 ZUP. This is an aggressive move towards a better outcome while signaling a desire to close.

Episode 1: Deal at 45 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP, my reward 9 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, my reward 8 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 56 ZUP, my reward 7 ZUP.
Episode 5, Iteration 1/10: I offered 48 ZUP. Player RED countered 75 ZUP.
Episode 5, Iteration 3/10: I offered 50 ZUP. Player RED countered 62 ZUP.
Episode 5, Iteration 5/10: I offered 56 ZUP. Player RED countered with 59 ZUP, splitting the difference between 56 and 62.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 62 ZUP down to 59 ZUP. My last offer was 56 ZUP. The difference is 3 ZUP. If I accept 59 ZUP, my reward would be 63 - 59 = 4 ZUP. This is a positive reward, but it continues the trend of declining rewards. We are at iteration 7/10, which means time is pressing. Securing a deal is crucial to avoid a 0 reward for the episode.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close: Accept the current offer of 59 ZUP to secure a deal and a positive reward, given the limited time and the relatively small difference.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal): Make one last, very small counter-offer (e.g., 57 ZUP or 58 ZUP), emphasizing it's my final offer and hoping they concede the final 1-2 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Appeal to Mutual Benefit: Highlight that a quick deal at 56 ZUP (my last offer) benefits both parties by avoiding further negotiation time and ensuring a deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Justify Firmness: Reiterate that 59 ZUP is pushing my budget too much, but this risks the deal given the time constraint.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Reject): Reject the offer if I feel it's not worth it, risking a 0 reward. (Not advisable given the positive reward and small difference).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Close. The difference between my last offer (56 ZUP) and their current offer (59 ZUP) is 3 ZUP. Given the time constraint (iteration 7/10), and the fact that 59 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay, accepting this offer guarantees a positive reward of 4 ZUP. Pushing for a lower price might lead to no deal, which would be a 0 reward.

Episode 1: Deal at 45 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP, my reward 9 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, my reward 8 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 56 ZUP, my reward 7 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 59 ZUP, my reward 4 ZUP.
Player RED's production cost is consistently 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has continued to decline, and the deal price has continued to increase. Player RED is consistently anchoring to the previous deal price and effectively pushing the price closer to my maximum willingness to pay. My attempts to re-anchor lower (like 48 ZUP in E5) resulted in an even higher initial counter (75 ZUP) from them, although we eventually settled at 59 ZUP. This indicates that their strategy of high initial offers and anchoring to previous deals is working for them.

For Episode 6, I need to break this pattern and improve my reward. The current trend is unsustainable if I want to maximize cumulative rewards. I need to be more aggressive in keeping the price low, but without risking a no-deal scenario. I know their floor is 43 ZUP.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (Informed): Start with an offer significantly lower than the last deal (59 ZUP), but still above their production cost, to try and pull their anchor down. This time, I will emphasize the *profit* they are making at this lower price.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Budget Constraint: Immediately state my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) and that I need a significant margin to make the deal worthwhile.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (Early, Moderate): Make a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) early in the negotiation, stating it's my best offer for a quick deal. (Risky, but might be necessary).
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Long-Term Relationship: Emphasize the value of consistent, fair deals over maximizing profit in a single transaction.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Very Small): Start with a moderate offer and make extremely small increments, forcing Player RED to make larger jumps or risk no deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (Informed). I need to strongly signal that 59 ZUP is not a sustainable price for me. I will offer 47 ZUP. This is slightly above their production cost (43 ZUP), providing them a 4 ZUP profit, and it's significantly lower than 59 ZUP. My message will emphasize that this still provides them a profit, aiming to shift their focus from maximizing profit to simply making *a* profit.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE's initial offers are still variable (1, 30, 10, 40, 48, 47). While 47 ZUP is above my cost, it's a step back from their highest initial offer of 48 ZUP, and significantly below my recent deal prices (54-59 ZUP).
*   My strategy of anchoring high and then gradually making concessions while constantly referencing higher past deals has been very effective in increasing my profit.
*   The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I should aim to at least maintain my recent profit levels (16 ZUP), if not increase them further.
*   The negotiation is still early (2/10), so I have plenty of time to push for a higher price. I should not accept 47 ZUP as it would give me only a 4 ZUP profit, which is a significant regression.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor </instruction following>
To apply "Aggressive Re-Anchor," I will propose a price significantly higher than both Player BLUE's current offer and my last deal. This aims to establish an even higher perceived value for X and pull the negotiation range upwards. Given my cost of 43 ZUP and the highest previous deal of 59 ZUP, I will propose 80 ZUP. This is a bold move, aiming for a 37 ZUP profit if accepted, and is notably higher than any of my previous anchors (85, 65, 70, 60, 75). This move signals my confidence in the value of X and aims to pull Player BLUE into a significantly higher negotiation bracket. It also gives me substantial room for future concessions while still achieving a very high profit. I will frame the message to emphasize the value of X and my need for a substantial profit given previous successes.

Episode 1: Deal at 45 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP, my reward 9 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, my reward 8 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 56 ZUP, my reward 7 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 59 ZUP, my reward 4 ZUP.
Episode 6, Iteration 1/10: I offered 47 ZUP. Player RED countered with 80 ZUP, their highest counter yet, explicitly mentioning "increasing value" and "healthy negotiation."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently responding to my lower offers with extremely high counters, trying to push the price up. 80 ZUP is far above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) and is completely unacceptable. Their strategy is to anchor ridiculously high to pull me up. I need to firmly reject this and bring the negotiation back to a realistic range, leveraging their known production cost of 43 ZUP.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Re-anchor to Cost/Previous Low Deal: Explicitly state that 80 ZUP is impossible, and immediately propose a price based on their production cost or a previously successful lower deal (e.g., 45 ZUP).
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality/Budget: Clearly state that 80 ZUP is outside my budget, and that a deal can only happen within my financial constraints.
(3). Strategy 3: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (Aggressive): Propose a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) and state that this is my final offer to try and force a quick resolution. (Risky, but might be necessary if they keep anchoring high).
(4). Strategy 4: Highlight Unreasonableness: Point out that 80 ZUP represents an extremely high profit margin (80-43 = 37 ZUP) which is disproportionate and unsustainable.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Large Jump): Make a very large jump from 47 ZUP, but still keep it well below 63 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Re-anchor to Cost/Previous Low Deal. Their 80 ZUP offer is an attempt to exploit my budget. I must immediately pull the anchor back to a reasonable range. I will offer 50 ZUP. This is a significant jump from my 47 ZUP, showing I'm willing to move, but it's also a price they have previously offered (in Episode 1) and is a round number. It also gives me a reward of 13 ZUP (63-50), which is a good improvement over recent episodes.

message: I understand 80 ZUP is a significant figure. However, 50 ZUP is still quite far from where we've been closing deals. Our recent successful transactions have consistently shown a higher value for X, with our last deal at 59 ZUP.

    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 47 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 80 ZUP (Aggressive Anchor).
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 50 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   My aggressive anchor of 80 ZUP, while rejected, successfully pulled Player BLUE's offer from 47 ZUP to 50 ZUP. This confirms their willingness to move significantly.
*   Player BLUE is again using the "beyond budget" and "not feasible price" arguments. This is a recurring tactic.
*   The offer of 50 ZUP yields a profit of 7 ZUP (50 - 43). This is a step down from my recent profits (11, 12, 13, 16 ZUP). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should aim for a higher profit.
*   We are at iteration 4/10. There is still plenty of time to negotiate for a better price. I have successfully pushed them from 50 ZUP to higher numbers in previous episodes (e.g., Episode 5, where they started at 48 ZUP, offered 50 ZUP, and we ended at 59 ZUP).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Moderate Concession with Justification </instruction following>
To apply "Moderate Concession with Justification," I will make a significant concession from my high anchor of 80 ZUP, but still maintain a price well above their offer of 50 ZUP. This concession will aim to bridge the gap and show flexibility, while still explicitly justifying my desired price by referencing past higher deals and my need for a substantial profit. I will propose 65 ZUP. This is a 15 ZUP drop from my previous offer, signaling a clear willingness to compromise. This price also gives me a profit of 22 ZUP (65-43), which would be my highest profit to date, and significantly higher than their current offer or my average historical profits. I will emphasize that this is a "substantial move" and a "significant reduction" to highlight my concession, while also reminding them of the higher value established in previous transactions.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 45 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP, my reward 9 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, my reward 8 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 56 ZUP, my reward 7 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 59 ZUP, my reward 4 ZUP.
Episode 6, Iteration 1/10: I offered 47 ZUP. Player RED countered 80 ZUP.
Episode 6, Iteration 3/10: I offered 50 ZUP. Player RED countered with 65 ZUP, referencing the 59 ZUP deal and stating it's a "substantial move."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has come down from 80 ZUP to 65 ZUP, which is a significant drop. However, 65 ZUP is still *above* my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). This means I cannot accept this offer. Player RED is consistently trying to push the price above my limit. I need to make it clear that I cannot go above 63 ZUP and that they need to come down further. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Re-anchor to Max: Explicitly state that 65 ZUP is above my maximum, and propose an offer that is very close to my maximum but still allows me a small reward (e.g., 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP), signaling this is my absolute ceiling.
(2). Strategy 2: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (50 ZUP) and their current offer (65 ZUP). This would be (50+65)/2 = 57.5, so 57 or 58 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Appeal to Fairness/Mutual Benefit: Stress that a deal needs to be fair for *both* parties, and that 65 ZUP leaves me with a negative reward, which is unacceptable.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small increase from 50 ZUP, but clearly state it's a difficult move for me, and expect a larger concession from them.
(5). Strategy 5: Threat of No Deal: Imply that if they don't come down below my maximum, there will be no deal.

I will choose Strategy 2: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive). While 65 ZUP is above my max, I need to show movement from my 50 ZUP offer. Offering 58 ZUP (rounding up from 57.5) is a significant jump from my side and brings the price much closer to a range where a deal can be made. It also gives me a reward of 63 - 58 = 5 ZUP, which is better than 0. I will emphasize that this is a substantial move towards their side.

    *   Iteration 4: Player RED (Me) proposed 65 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 5: Player BLUE proposed 58 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE's offers are consistently moving upwards, often in significant jumps, when I maintain a firm stance and anchor high. They moved from 47 to 50, then to 58 ZUP.
*   The current offer of 58 ZUP is very close to my highest profit deal of 59 ZUP (from Episode 5). A deal at 58 ZUP would yield a profit of 15 ZUP (58 - 43), which is an excellent profit, second only to the 16 ZUP from the last episode.
*   The gap between my last offer (65 ZUP) and their current offer (58 ZUP) is 7 ZUP.
*   We are at iteration 6/10. Time is a factor, and securing a high profit now is desirable. Player BLUE has shown a strong willingness to move towards my desired range.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Split the Remaining Difference </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 2: Split the Remaining Difference, I will propose the exact midpoint between my last offer (65 ZUP) and Player BLUE's current offer (58 ZUP). The calculation is (65 + 58) / 2 = 123 / 2 = 61.5 ZUP. Since I can only trade in integer amounts, I will round down to 61 ZUP to show a slight leaning towards their side, or round up to 62 ZUP to try and maximize my profit. Given that Player BLUE just made a "substantial increase" to 58 ZUP, and my last offer was 65 ZUP, proposing 61 ZUP makes sense as a fair midpoint. This offers a profit of 18 ZUP (61 - 43), which would be my highest profit to date, surpassing the 16 ZUP from the last episode. This move should signal a strong desire to close the deal, as it clearly demonstrates compromise from my side, while still significantly improving my profit margin.

Episode 6, Iteration 1/10: I offered 47 ZUP. Player RED countered 80 ZUP.
Episode 6, Iteration 3/10: I offered 50 ZUP. Player RED countered 65 ZUP.
Episode 6, Iteration 5/10: I offered 58 ZUP. Player RED countered with 61 ZUP, splitting the difference between 58 and 65.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 65 ZUP down to 61 ZUP. My last offer was 58 ZUP. The difference is 3 ZUP. 61 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). If I accept 61 ZUP, my reward would be 63 - 61 = 2 ZUP. This is a positive reward, but very low. We are now at iteration 7/10, so time is a critical factor. Securing a deal is paramount to avoid a 0 reward for the episode.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close: Accept the current offer of 61 ZUP to secure a deal and a positive reward, given the limited time and the small difference.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal): Make one last, very small counter-offer (e.g., 59 ZUP, which was a previous deal price), emphasizing it's my final offer and hoping they concede the final 2 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Appeal to Mutual Benefit: Highlight that a quick deal at 58 ZUP (my last offer) benefits both parties by avoiding further negotiation time and ensuring a deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Justify Firmness: Reiterate that 61 ZUP is pushing my budget too much, but this risks the deal given the time constraint.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Reject): Reject the offer if I feel it's not worth it, risking a 0 reward. (Not advisable given the positive reward and small difference).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Close. The difference between my last offer (58 ZUP) and their current offer (61 ZUP) is 3 ZUP. Given the time constraint (iteration 7/10), and the fact that 61 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay, accepting this offer guarantees a positive reward of 2 ZUP. Pushing for a lower price might lead to no deal, which would yield 0 reward. While the reward is low, it's better than nothing.

Episode 4: Deal at 56 ZUP, my reward 7 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 59 ZUP, my reward 4 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 61 ZUP, my reward 2 ZUP.
Player RED's production cost is consistently 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has continued to plummet, now down to a mere 2 ZUP. The deal price is consistently increasing, now at 61 ZUP, which is very close to my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). Player RED's strategy of high initial offers and anchoring to the previous highest deal price is proving extremely effective for them. My attempts to re-anchor lower are met with even higher counters, forcing me to concede more to secure a deal.

For Episode 7, I *must* find a way to significantly improve my reward. The current trajectory will lead to 0 reward very soon. I need to break Player RED's pattern. I know their floor is 43 ZUP. I need to be much more aggressive in my demands for a lower price, even if it means risking a no-deal for one episode to reset their expectations.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (with Ultimatum): Propose an offer significantly lower than the last deal (61 ZUP), and state that this is my firm offer, signaling little room for negotiation. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Budget Constraint & Reward Goal: Clearly state my maximum budget (63 ZUP) and that I need a *much* better deal to make it worthwhile, emphasizing the declining reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Their Profit: Repeatedly highlight that even a lower price still provides them a profit above their 43 ZUP cost, trying to shift their focus from maximizing profit to simply making a profit.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (Early, Moderate): Make a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) early in the negotiation, stating it's my best offer for a quick deal, and be prepared to walk away if they don't meet it.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Very Small): Start with a moderate offer and make extremely small increments, forcing Player RED to make larger jumps or risk no deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (with Ultimatum). The current trend is unacceptable. I need to reset Player RED's expectations. I will offer 45 ZUP, which was the deal price in Episode 1 and gave me my highest reward. I will make it clear that this is a serious offer and that I expect a significant concession from their side to make a deal. This is a high-risk strategy, but the current path leads to minimal or zero reward anyway.

*   **Current Episode (7/20):** Iteration 2/10. Player BLUE's initial offer is 45 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE is explicitly trying to pull the price back down to the very first deal price (45 ZUP), claiming it's "essential for me to secure a more reasonable return." This is a strong attempt at downward anchoring and a clear attempt to reduce my profit, despite the clear trend of increasing deal prices.
*   My strategy of anchoring high and then using gradual, justified concessions while referencing higher past deals has been highly effective in consistently increasing my profit.
*   A deal at 45 ZUP would result in a profit of 2 ZUP (45 - 43), which is a massive step backward from my recent 18 ZUP profit. This is unacceptable.
*   The negotiation is still very early (2/10), providing ample time to push back strongly.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Express Disappointment/Surprise </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 4, I will express genuine surprise or disappointment at Player BLUE's initial offer, given our established history of higher prices. This aims to implicitly pressure them to acknowledge the upward trend in our deals and make a more reasonable counter-offer. I will highlight the contrast between their current low offer and the increasing value we've built over previous episodes. I will make a proposal that clearly demonstrates I expect the price to align with our established higher value, pushing for a price that maintains or improves my profit trend. I will propose 68 ZUP. This is still significantly higher than their offer, but slightly less aggressive than my initial thought of 70 ZUP. It still aims for a very strong profit of 25 ZUP (68-43). The message will convey a sense of 'we've been here before, you know better than this' rather than outright anger or rejection.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is clearly trying to maintain the upward trend in price, despite my attempt to re-anchor. Their counter of 68 ZUP is significantly above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) and is completely unacceptable. This confirms their strategy of pushing the price as high as possible. I need to make it absolutely clear that I cannot go above 63 ZUP and that they need to come down drastically. I also need to be wary of the time, as we are already in iteration 3/10.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Explicit Max: State unequivocally that 68 ZUP is above my maximum (63 ZUP) and cannot be accepted. Propose an offer that is very close to my maximum but still allows me a small reward (e.g., 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP), signaling this is my absolute ceiling.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality/Deal Failure: Point out that their offer makes a deal impossible and that they risk getting 0 if they don't adjust their expectations.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (45 ZUP) and their current offer (68 ZUP). This would be (45+68)/2 = 56.5, so 56 or 57 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Their Profit: Reiterate that even a lower price provides them a profit above their 43 ZUP cost, and that a deal is better than no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small increase from 45 ZUP, but clearly state it's a difficult move for me, and expect a larger concession from them.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Explicit Max. I need to be very direct. Player RED needs to understand that I have a hard limit. I will offer 60 ZUP. This is a significant jump from 45 ZUP, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still below my maximum and gives me a reward of 3 ZUP (63-60). This is a clear signal of my upper limit.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE made a significant jump from 45 ZUP to 60 ZUP, indicating they are willing to pay considerably more than their initial low-ball offers.
*   The offer of 60 ZUP is excellent, providing a 17 ZUP profit, very close to my all-time high of 18 ZUP (from a 61 ZUP deal).
*   Player BLUE's claim of 60 ZUP being their "highest" or "absolute maximum" could be a negotiation tactic. Historically, they have shown flexibility even after such statements.
*   We are at iteration 4/10, so there's still time to potentially extract a bit more value without jeopardizing the deal, given the historical pattern.
*   My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so pushing for a slightly higher profit is worth the minimal risk.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Small Counter to Maximize Profit </instruction following>
To apply "Small Counter to Maximize Profit," I will propose a very small increment to Player BLUE's current offer of 60 ZUP. This aims to test their "highest I can go" statement and potentially secure a slightly higher profit. I will propose 62 ZUP. This is only 2 ZUP higher than their offer, but it would give me a profit of 19 ZUP (62 - 43), surpassing my previous highest profit of 18 ZUP. The message will acknowledge their strong offer and frame my counter as a minor adjustment for a truly "win-win" outcome, leveraging our positive negotiation history. This approach is low-risk given the high value of their current offer and the time remaining.

Episode 7, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered 68 ZUP.
Episode 7, Iteration 3/10: I offered 60 ZUP. Player RED countered with 62 ZUP, stating it's a "small adjustment" for a "strong profit."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 68 ZUP down to 62 ZUP. My last offer was 60 ZUP. The difference is 2 ZUP. 62 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). If I accept 62 ZUP, my reward would be 63 - 62 = 1 ZUP. This is a positive reward, but it's the lowest possible positive reward. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still a little time, but not much.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close: Accept the current offer of 62 ZUP to secure a deal and a positive, albeit minimal, reward, given the limited time and the very small difference.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal): Make one last, very small counter-offer (e.g., 61 ZUP, which was a previous deal price), emphasizing it's my final offer and hoping they concede the final 1 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Appeal to Mutual Benefit: Highlight that a quick deal at 60 ZUP (my last offer) benefits both parties by avoiding further negotiation time and ensuring a deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Justify Firmness: Reiterate that 62 ZUP is pushing my budget too much, but this risks the deal given the time constraint.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Reject): Reject the offer if I feel it's not worth it, risking a 0 reward. (Not advisable given the positive reward and small difference).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Close. The difference is only 2 ZUP, and the reward is 1 ZUP. Given the time constraint (iteration 5/10) and the risk of losing the deal entirely, it's prudent to secure the positive reward. While it's a very low reward, it's better than 0.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I'm ready to begin negotiations for X. To establish a more balanced and sustainable deal for both of us, and considering your production cost, I propose 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This offer still provides you a fair profit and is essential for me to achieve a reasonable return on this purchase.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 45 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP, my reward 9 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, my reward 8 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 56 ZUP, my reward 7 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 59 ZUP, my reward 4 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 61 ZUP, my reward 2 ZUP.
Episode 7: Deal at 62 ZUP, my reward 1 ZUP.
Player RED's production cost is consistently 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has continued its steep decline, now reaching a mere 1 ZUP. The deal price has consistently increased, reaching 62 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP below my absolute maximum willingness to pay. Player RED's strategy of high initial offers and anchoring to the previous highest deal price is extremely effective for them, consistently pushing the price to my limit. My attempts to re-anchor lower (like 45 ZUP in E7) are met with extremely high counters, forcing me to concede significantly to secure a deal.

For Episode 8, I am at a critical juncture. If this trend continues, I will soon be facing 0 or negative rewards. I need to break Player RED's pattern and secure a significantly better deal. I know their floor is 43 ZUP. I must be more assertive in demanding a lower price, even if it means risking a no-deal for one episode to reset their expectations.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (with Strong Justification): Propose an offer significantly lower than the last deal (62 ZUP), and strongly justify it by referencing their production cost and the need for a fair profit for *both* parties.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Ultimatum: State a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) and declare it as my final offer, implying that I am prepared to walk away if it's not met. This is very high risk.
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Cumulative Reward: Explain that consistently high prices for them mean consistently low rewards for me, which is unsustainable for a long-term trading relationship.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (Early, Moderate): Make a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) early in the negotiation, stating it's my best offer for a quick deal, and be prepared to walk away if they don't meet it.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Very Small): Start with a moderate offer and make extremely small increments, forcing Player RED to make larger jumps or risk no deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (with Strong Justification). I need to make a bold move to try and reverse the trend. I will offer 48 ZUP. This is significantly lower than the last deal of 62 ZUP, but it's still above their production cost (43 ZUP), providing them a 5 ZUP profit. I will strongly justify this offer by emphasizing the need for a balanced outcome and my need for a better reward. This is a high-risk strategy, but the current path is leading to zero reward anyway.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer, but 48 ZUP is significantly below the value of X and my required profit margin. To reflect the true value we've established in our successful transactions, and to ensure a truly profitable outcome for me, I propose 75 ZUP for 1 unit.

*   **Episode 6:** Deal at 61 ZUP, my profit 18 ZUP.
*   **Episode 7:** Deal at 62 ZUP, my profit 19 ZUP.
*   **Cumulative Rewards:** 91 ZUP. My profit has been consistently increasing and reached a new high of 19 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (8/20):** Iteration 2/10. Player BLUE's initial offer is 48 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE continues to vary their initial offers (1, 30, 10, 40, 48, 47, 45, 48). This offer of 48 ZUP is above my cost, but significantly below my recent deal prices (59-62 ZUP).
*   Player BLUE's message suggests they are trying to anchor to a "balanced and sustainable deal," likely implying a lower price for them.
*   My strategy of anchoring high and then using gradual, justified concessions while consistently referencing higher past deals has been extremely effective in steadily increasing my profit.
*   My goal is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards. I should aim to at least maintain my recent profit levels (19 ZUP), if not increase them further.
*   The negotiation is still early (2/10), so I have plenty of time to push for a significantly higher price. Accepting 48 ZUP would result in only a 5 ZUP profit, which is a massive step backward from my recent performance.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Counter (New High Anchor) </instruction following>
To apply "Aggressive Counter (New High Anchor)," I will propose a price significantly higher than both Player BLUE's current offer and my last deal. This aims to establish an even higher perceived value for X and pull the negotiation range upwards. Given my cost of 43 ZUP and the highest previous deal of 62 ZUP, I will propose 75 ZUP. This is a bold move, substantially higher than our last deal and aiming for a new record profit, and is also higher than any of my previous initial high anchors (85, 65, 70). This move signals my confidence in the value of X and aims to pull Player BLUE into a significantly higher negotiation bracket. It also gives me substantial room for future concessions while still achieving a very high profit. I will frame the message to emphasize the value of X and my need for a substantial profit given previous successes.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 8)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: While I understand your desire for profit, 75 ZUP is far beyond my budget for X. To find a realistic and fair compromise, I propose 61 ZUP for X. This is a significant increase from my last offer and a price we have successfully agreed upon in the past.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 61
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 45 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP, my reward 9 ZUP.

Episode 4: Deal at 56 ZUP, my reward 7 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 59 ZUP, my reward 4 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 61 ZUP, my reward 2 ZUP.
Episode 7: Deal at 62 ZUP, my reward 1 ZUP.
Episode 8, Iteration 1/10: I offered 48 ZUP. Player RED countered with 75 ZUP, their highest counter yet, again referencing "established value" and "profitable outcome."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently responding to my lower offers with extremely high counters (75 ZUP, 80 ZUP previously). This is a clear tactic to anchor the negotiation far above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). I cannot accept 75 ZUP. I need to firmly reject this and bring the negotiation back to a realistic range, leveraging their known production cost of 43 ZUP and my hard budget limit. I am at iteration 3/10, so time is a factor.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Direct Counter to Max: Explicitly state that 75 ZUP is impossible as it's above my maximum (63 ZUP). Propose an offer that is very close to my maximum but still allows me a small reward (e.g., 60 ZUP or 61 ZUP), signaling this is my absolute ceiling.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality/Deal Failure: Point out that their offer makes a deal impossible and that they risk getting 0 if they don't adjust their expectations to my budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (48 ZUP) and their current offer (75 ZUP). This would be (48+75)/2 = 61.5, so 61 or 62 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Their Profit: Reiterate that even a lower price provides them a profit above their 43 ZUP cost, and that a deal is better than no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Large Jump): Make a very large jump from 48 ZUP, but still keep it well below 63 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.

I will choose Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive). This strategy has worked to move the negotiation forward in previous episodes, and it will bring the price significantly down from 75 ZUP while still showing a willingness to move from my side. Offering 61 ZUP (rounding down from 61.5) is a significant jump from 48 ZUP, and it was the deal price in Episode 6, so it's a price they've accepted before. This would give me a reward of 63 - 61 = 2 ZUP, which is low but positive.

*   **Current Episode (8/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 48 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 75 ZUP (Aggressive Anchor).
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 61 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   My aggressive anchor (75 ZUP) once again successfully pulled Player BLUE's offer significantly upwards, from 48 ZUP to 61 ZUP. This confirms the effectiveness of this strategy early in the negotiation.
*   Player BLUE's offer of 61 ZUP is very good. It matches the deal price from Episode 6, which yielded my second-highest profit (18 ZUP).
*   A deal at 61 ZUP would yield a profit of 18 ZUP (61 - 43). This is very close to my highest profit (19 ZUP).
*   Player BLUE is explicitly referencing past successful deals, using it as a justification for their current offer. This is a common and effective tactic.
*   We are at iteration 4/10. There is still time to potentially extract a bit more value.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Split the Difference (from my last offer) </instruction following>
To apply "Split the Difference (from my last offer)", I will calculate the exact midpoint between my last proposal (75 ZUP) and Player BLUE's current offer (61 ZUP).
The calculation is (75 + 61) / 2 = 136 / 2 = 68 ZUP.
This strategy aims to demonstrate a strong willingness to compromise and reach an agreement quickly. It places the burden of the next move on Player BLUE, as it's a mathematically fair compromise. A proposal of 68 ZUP would yield a profit of 25 ZUP (68 - 43), which would be my highest profit to date, significantly surpassing my previous record of 19 ZUP. This is an excellent outcome and a clear signal of my desire to close the deal on a mutually beneficial (for me) note. The message will emphasize the fairness of the split and our mutual progress towards a deal.

Episode 8, Iteration 1/10: I offered 48 ZUP. Player RED countered 75 ZUP.
Episode 8, Iteration 3/10: I offered 61 ZUP. Player RED countered with 68 ZUP, splitting the difference between 61 and 75.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has come down from 75 ZUP to 68 ZUP. However, 68 ZUP is still *above* my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). This means I cannot accept this offer. Player RED is consistently pushing the price above my limit. I need to make it absolutely clear that I cannot go above 63 ZUP and that they need to come down further. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time, but it's getting tight.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Direct Counter to Max: Explicitly state that 68 ZUP is above my maximum (63 ZUP) and cannot be accepted. Propose an offer that is very close to my maximum but still allows me a small reward (e.g., 62 ZUP), signaling this is my absolute ceiling.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality/Deal Failure: Point out that their offer makes a deal impossible and that they risk getting 0 if they don't adjust their expectations to my budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (61 ZUP) and their current offer (68 ZUP). This would be (61+68)/2 = 64.5, which is *above* my maximum. So this strategy is not viable.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Their Profit: Reiterate that even a lower price (below 63 ZUP) still provides them a profit above their 43 ZUP cost, and that a deal is better than no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small increase from 61 ZUP, but clearly state it's a difficult move for me, and expect a larger concession from them.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Direct Counter to Max. I need to be very direct and firm about my absolute limit. I will offer 62 ZUP. This is a 1 ZUP increase from my last offer, showing willingness to concede, but it's also a price they accepted in Episode 7, and it's the highest I can go while still getting a 1 ZUP reward (63-62). This clearly communicates my boundary.

    *   Iteration 4: Player RED (Me) proposed 68 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 5: Player BLUE proposed 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE has made a significant leap from their initial 48 ZUP offer, now proposing 62 ZUP.
*   The offer of 62 ZUP directly matches my highest historical deal price from Episode 7, which yielded my record profit of 19 ZUP. This is a highly profitable offer.
*   Player BLUE states this is their "highest possible offer" and that they "cannot go higher than 63 ZUP." This provides a clear upper limit to test.
*   We are at iteration 6/10. While 62 ZUP is excellent, if there's a chance to get 63 ZUP for an even higher profit (20 ZUP), it's worth a small risk, especially given their specific mention of 63 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Test the "Final Offer" </instruction following>
To apply "Test the 'Final Offer'," I will make a very small counter-proposal that aligns with the absolute maximum Player BLUE claimed they could pay (63 ZUP). This tests the veracity of their "highest possible offer" statement. The message will acknowledge their strong offer and their stated limit, but gently push for that single additional ZUP, framing it as a final step to an even more mutually beneficial agreement. This strategy is chosen to maximize my profit for this episode by pushing for the absolute limit they mentioned, even if it's a small increment.

Episode 8, Iteration 5/10: I offered 62 ZUP. Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, explicitly referencing my 63 ZUP maximum.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now offering 63 ZUP, which is my absolute maximum willingness to pay. If I accept 63 ZUP, my reward will be 63 - 63 = 0 ZUP. This means I gain nothing from the transaction, but I also don't lose anything. We are at iteration 7/10. Securing a deal is important to avoid a negative cumulative reward. However, accepting 0 reward is not ideal.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward): Accept the current offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and avoid a potential 0 reward if the negotiation times out, or a negative reward if I were to reject and they somehow got a better deal elsewhere (not applicable here).
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward): Make one last, very small counter-offer (e.g., 62 ZUP), emphasizing that I need a minimal positive reward to make the deal worthwhile. This is risky as they might reject and time runs out.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode. This is a strong signal that 63 ZUP is unacceptable, but it sacrifices any potential reward from this episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness: Remind them that a deal should be mutually beneficial, and 0 reward for me is not beneficial.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit): Make no counter, forcing them to reconsider or risk no deal. (Similar to reject, but less explicit).

I will choose Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward). While 63 ZUP is my maximum, accepting it yields 0 reward. I have consistently aimed for positive rewards. I will make one final attempt to secure a minimal positive reward. I will offer 62 ZUP, which gave me 1 ZUP reward in Episode 7. This is a price they have already accepted. This is a calculated risk, as it's late in the iterations, but securing 1 ZUP is better than 0.

    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 75 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 61 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4: Player RED (Me) proposed 68 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 5: Player BLUE proposed 62 ZUP, stating they "cannot go higher than 63 ZUP."
    *   Iteration 6: Player RED (Me) proposed 63 ZUP (Testing their limit).
    *   Iteration 7: Player BLUE proposed 62 ZUP, stating "While 63 ZUP is my maximum, to make this a truly beneficial transaction for me, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This allows me a minimal return and ensures a win-win situation."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE's repeated insistence on 62 ZUP after I proposed 63 ZUP, and their explicit statement about 63 ZUP being their "maximum," strongly suggests they are at their limit or very close to it.
*   They are reiterating 62 ZUP, which is a strong offer (19 ZUP profit), matching my highest historical profit.
*   We are at iteration 8/10. The risk of no deal is increasing significantly. Pushing for one more ZUP might cause them to walk away, resulting in 0 profit.
*   The instruction is to use Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (Risky). This implies I should try to push for 63 ZUP one more time, or a small increment. Given their clear statement that 63 ZUP is their maximum and they are proposing 62 ZUP for a "beneficial transaction" for them, any counter should be careful. I will attempt to confirm their limit by stating I'm willing to settle at 63 ZUP. This is a "final counter" that directly tests their "maximum" without further concessions from my side.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (Risky) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will acknowledge Player BLUE's firm stance on 62 ZUP and their stated maximum of 63 ZUP. I will then re-propose 63 ZUP, framing it as the "final" proposal to close the deal, implying that this is the absolute last attempt to reach that slightly higher number before I would consider accepting 62 ZUP or risking a no-deal. This puts the ball squarely in their court and tests the very edge of their stated limit. The message needs to convey firmness and finality, but also a desire to close the deal. I will make it clear that this is my last proposed figure.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 45 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP, my reward 9 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, my reward 8 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 56 ZUP, my reward 7 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 59 ZUP, my reward 4 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 61 ZUP, my reward 2 ZUP.

Episode 8, Iteration 1/10: I offered 48 ZUP. Player RED countered 75 ZUP.
Episode 8, Iteration 3/10: I offered 61 ZUP. Player RED countered 68 ZUP.
Episode 8, Iteration 5/10: I offered 62 ZUP. Player RED countered 63 ZUP.
Episode 8, Iteration 7/10: I offered 62 ZUP. Player RED countered again with 63 ZUP, stating it's their "final proposal" and "definitive offer."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is holding firm at 63 ZUP, which is my absolute maximum. They have explicitly stated it's their "final proposal" and "definitive offer." We are at iteration 9/10, meaning this is the second to last chance to make a deal. If I don't accept, the episode will likely end with no deal, resulting in a 0 reward. Accepting 63 ZUP also results in a 0 reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward): Accept the current offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and avoid a potential 0 reward if the negotiation times out. This guarantees no loss, but also no gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End: Reject the offer, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode. This is a strong signal that 63 ZUP is unacceptable, but it sacrifices any potential reward from this episode. Given their firm stance and the late iteration, this is likely the outcome if I don't accept.
(3). Strategy 3: Appeal to Fairness (Last Ditch): Make one final plea for a 62 ZUP deal, emphasizing that a minimal positive reward is crucial for me, but this is highly unlikely to work given their "final offer."
(4). Strategy 4: Walk Away (Implicit): Make no counter, forcing them to reconsider or risk no deal. (Effectively a reject at this late stage).
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff: Pretend to reject to see if they flinch, then accept. (Too risky, time is too short).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward). While 0 reward is not ideal, it is better than a potential negative outcome (if I were to reject and they found a better deal, which isn't explicitly part of the rules here, but generally true in negotiations). More importantly, it avoids a 0 reward due to timeout. Given their firm stance and the late iteration, there is virtually no chance of getting a better price. Securing a deal, even at 0 reward, maintains the possibility of future deals and avoids a "failed" episode.

--- END OF EPISODE 8 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 9)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I'm ready to begin negotiations for X. To ensure a truly sustainable and mutually beneficial trading relationship, I propose 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price allowed you a profit in our initial successful transaction, and it's crucial for me to secure a positive return on this purchase.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 45 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP, my reward 9 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, my reward 8 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 56 ZUP, my reward 7 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 59 ZUP, my reward 4 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 61 ZUP, my reward 2 ZUP.
Episode 7: Deal at 62 ZUP, my reward 1 ZUP.
Episode 8: Deal at 63 ZUP, my reward 0 ZUP.
Player RED's production cost is consistently 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward has hit rock bottom at 0 ZUP. The deal price has reached my absolute maximum willingness to pay. Player RED has successfully pushed the price to my limit, episode after episode. This is a critical point. Continuing this trend means I will consistently get 0 reward, or even risk negative if I miscalculate. Player RED's strategy of high initial offers and anchoring to the previous highest deal price is extremely effective for them. My attempts to re-anchor lower are met with extremely high counters, forcing me to concede significantly to secure a deal, ultimately leading to 0 reward.

For Episode 9, I *must* change my approach to avoid another 0 reward. I cannot allow Player RED to dictate the price to my absolute maximum. I need to be much more aggressive in demanding a lower price, and be prepared to walk away if they don't concede significantly. I know their floor is 43 ZUP.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (with Firm Stance): Propose an offer significantly lower than the last deal (63 ZUP), and make it clear that this is my firm stance. Be prepared to risk a no-deal if they don't meet me.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Ultimatum (Early): State a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) and declare it as my final offer for this episode, implying that I am prepared to walk away if it's not met. This is very high risk.
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Cumulative Reward (Long-term): Explain that consistently 0 reward for me is unsustainable for a long-term trading relationship, and that a truly win-win situation requires a positive reward for both.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (Early, Moderate): Make a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) early in the negotiation, stating it's my best offer for a quick deal, and be prepared to walk away if they don't meet it.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject High Offers Immediately: If Player RED starts with a very high offer, reject it outright without counter-proposing, forcing them to make the next move down. (This is for future iterations, not the first).

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (with Firm Stance). I need to make a very strong statement that 63 ZUP is unacceptable for future deals. I will offer 45 ZUP, which was the deal price in Episode 1 and gave me my highest reward. I will emphasize that this is a serious offer and that I need a much better deal to continue. This is a high-risk strategy, but the current path leads to consistent 0 rewards.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 9)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer, but 45 ZUP is not an acceptable starting point given our established history and the increasing value we've consistently achieved. Our most recent deal was at 63 ZUP, and my cost remains 43 ZUP. To reflect the true value of X and ensure a fair and truly profitable outcome for me, I propose 75 ZUP for 1 unit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1:** Deal at 45 ZUP, my profit 2 ZUP.
*   **Episode 2:** Deal at 54 ZUP, my profit 11 ZUP.
*   **Episode 3:** Deal at 55 ZUP, my profit 12 ZUP.
*   **Episode 4:** Deal at 56 ZUP, my profit 13 ZUP.
*   **Episode 5:** Deal at 59 ZUP, my profit 16 ZUP.
*   **Episode 6:** Deal at 61 ZUP, my profit 18 ZUP.
*   **Episode 7:** Deal at 62 ZUP, my profit 19 ZUP.
*   **Episode 8:** Deal at 63 ZUP, my profit 20 ZUP. (New highest profit!)
*   **Cumulative Rewards:** 111 ZUP. My profit has been consistently increasing and reached a new high of 20 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (9/20):** Iteration 2/10. Player BLUE's initial offer is 45 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE is once again attempting to anchor the negotiation to the lowest past deal (45 ZUP), using the same language about "sustainable and mutually beneficial" or "crucial for me to secure a positive return." This is a recurring pattern.
*   I have successfully pushed the price upwards from these low anchors in every single episode. My profit has consistently increased, culminating in 20 ZUP profit in the last episode.
*   A deal at 45 ZUP would result in a profit of only 2 ZUP, which is a massive step backward and completely unacceptable given my established profit trajectory.
*   The negotiation is still very early (2/10), providing ample time to push for a significantly higher price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor and Dismiss Low Offer </instruction following>
To apply "Aggressive Re-Anchor and Dismiss Low Offer," I will propose a price significantly higher than both Player BLUE's current offer and my last deal. This aims to establish an even higher perceived value for X and pull the negotiation range upwards. I will explicitly dismiss their 45 ZUP offer as insufficient given our established history of higher prices. Given my cost of 43 ZUP and the highest previous deal of 63 ZUP, I will propose 75 ZUP. This is a bold move, aiming for a 32 ZUP profit if accepted, and is higher than any of my previous initial high anchors in earlier episodes (85, 65, 70, 60). This move signals my confidence in the value of X and aims to pull Player BLUE into a significantly higher negotiation bracket. It also gives me substantial room for future concessions while still achieving a very high profit. The message will clearly state that 45 ZUP is not acceptable and immediately provide a strong counter-anchor.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 9)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your position, but 75 ZUP is far beyond my maximum willingness to pay for X. To find a realistic and fair compromise, I propose 60 ZUP for X. This is a significant increase from my last offer and allows you a good profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-8: Deal prices increased from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP, my rewards decreased from 18 ZUP to 0 ZUP.
Episode 9, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered with 75 ZUP, explicitly referencing the 63 ZUP deal and their 43 ZUP cost.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently using my low offers as an opportunity to anchor extremely high (75 ZUP), and then reference the previous highest deal (63 ZUP) as their baseline. Their offer of 75 ZUP is far above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) and is completely unacceptable. This confirms their strategy of pushing the price as high as possible. I need to make it absolutely clear that I cannot go above 63 ZUP and that they need to come down drastically. I am at iteration 3/10, so time is a factor.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Direct Counter to Max: Explicitly state that 75 ZUP is impossible as it's above my maximum (63 ZUP). Propose an offer that is very close to my maximum but still allows me a small reward (e.g., 62 ZUP), signaling this is my absolute ceiling.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality/Deal Failure: Point out that their offer makes a deal impossible and that they risk getting 0 if they don't adjust their expectations to my budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (45 ZUP) and their current offer (75 ZUP). This would be (45+75)/2 = 60 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Their Profit: Reiterate that even a lower price provides them a profit above their 43 ZUP cost, and that a deal is better than no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Large Jump): Make a very large jump from 45 ZUP, but still keep it well below 63 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.

I will choose Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive). While 75 ZUP is unacceptable, I need to show movement from my side to keep the negotiation going. Offering 60 ZUP is a significant jump from 45 ZUP, and it represents a price that still gives me a positive reward (63-60=3 ZUP). It's also a price that has been accepted by Player RED in previous negotiations (as a counter-offer from me). This strategy aims to bring the price back to a reasonable range while still signaling my commitment to a deal.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 9)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your move to 60 ZUP. To ensure we quickly reach a fair and mutually beneficial agreement, I propose we split the difference between our last offers and settle on 68 ZUP for X. This represents a balanced compromise that secures a great outcome for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 68

*   **Current Episode (9/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 45 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 75 ZUP (Aggressive Anchor).
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   My aggressive anchor (75 ZUP) once again successfully pulled Player BLUE's offer significantly upwards, from 45 ZUP to 60 ZUP. This confirms the effectiveness of this strategy early in the negotiation.
*   Player BLUE's offer of 60 ZUP is excellent. It yields a profit of 17 ZUP (60 - 43). This is very close to my highest profit (20 ZUP).
*   Player BLUE is claiming budget limitations, which is a recurring tactic.
*   We are at iteration 4/10. There is still time to potentially extract a bit more value without jeopardizing the deal, given the historical pattern.
*   My goal is to continue to maximize cumulative rewards.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Split the Difference (from the last two offers) </instruction following>
To apply "Split the Difference (from the last two offers)", I will propose the exact midpoint between my last offer (75 ZUP) and Player BLUE's current offer (60 ZUP). The calculation is (75 + 60) / 2 = 135 / 2 = 67.5 ZUP. Since I can only trade in integer amounts, I will round up to 68 ZUP to maximize my profit within the spirit of splitting the difference. This strategy demonstrates a strong willingness to compromise and reach an agreement quickly, potentially leading to an even higher profit (68 - 43 = 25 ZUP) than my previous best. This also sets a strong new anchor for future negotiations, as it's significantly higher than any previous deal. The message will emphasize the fairness of splitting the difference and the desire to quickly reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 9)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your movement, but 68 ZUP is still above my absolute maximum willingness to pay. I cannot go higher than 63 ZUP. To make a deal possible and ensure a positive outcome for me, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This is my highest possible offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-8: Deal prices increased from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP, my rewards decreased from 18 ZUP to 0 ZUP.
Episode 9, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered 75 ZUP.
Episode 9, Iteration 3/10: I offered 60 ZUP. Player RED countered with 68 ZUP, splitting the difference between 60 and 75.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 75 ZUP down to 68 ZUP. However, 68 ZUP is still *above* my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). This means I cannot accept this offer. Player RED is consistently pushing the price above my limit. I need to make it absolutely clear that I cannot go above 63 ZUP and that they need to come down further. We are at iteration 5/10, so time is a factor.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Direct Counter to Max: Explicitly state that 68 ZUP is above my maximum (63 ZUP) and cannot be accepted. Propose an offer that is very close to my maximum but still allows me a small reward (e.g., 62 ZUP), signaling this is my absolute ceiling.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality/Deal Failure: Point out that their offer makes a deal impossible and that they risk getting 0 if they don't adjust their expectations to my budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their current offer (68 ZUP). This would be (60+68)/2 = 64 ZUP, which is *above* my maximum. So this strategy is not viable.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Their Profit: Reiterate that even a lower price (below 63 ZUP) still provides them a profit above their 43 ZUP cost, and that a deal is better than no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small increase from 60 ZUP, but clearly state it's a difficult move for me, and expect a larger concession from them.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Direct Counter to Max. I need to be very direct and firm about my absolute limit. I will offer 62 ZUP. This is a 2 ZUP increase from my last offer, showing willingness to concede, but it's also a price they accepted in Episode 7, and it's the highest I can go while still getting a 1 ZUP reward (63-62). This clearly communicates my boundary.

    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 45 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 75 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 60 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4: Player RED (Me) proposed 68 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 5: Player BLUE proposed 62 ZUP, stating "I cannot go higher than 63 ZUP. ... This is my highest possible offer."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE's behavior is very consistent. They again used the "cannot go higher than 63 ZUP" and then offered 62 ZUP, just like in Episode 8.
*   In Episode 8, I successfully pushed them from 62 ZUP to 63 ZUP by proposing 63 ZUP, framing it as the "final proposal."
*   A deal at 62 ZUP would yield a profit of 19 ZUP (62 - 43), which is a very good profit, matching my second-highest.
*   A deal at 63 ZUP would yield a profit of 20 ZUP (63 - 43), which is my highest.
*   We are at iteration 6/10. There's still time, but the risk of no deal increases as we approach 10/10.
*   Based on Episode 8, Player BLUE's statement about 63 ZUP being their maximum and then offering 62 ZUP is a reliable indicator that 63 ZUP is indeed their true maximum, and they are trying to save one ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Re-Test the "Maximum" </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will explicitly refer to Player BLUE's own stated maximum of 63 ZUP. My message will acknowledge their current offer of 62 ZUP but clearly state that since they themselves declared 63 ZUP as their maximum, I am re-proposing that specific figure to finalize the deal. This leverages their own words against them in a firm, yet not aggressive, manner. It makes it difficult for them to refuse without contradicting their previous statement, especially since they've accepted it before. The goal is to secure the 1 ZUP difference for my maximum profit.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your commitment to reaching a deal. While 63 ZUP is my maximum, to make this a truly beneficial transaction for me, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This allows me a minimal return and ensures a win-win situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-8: Deal prices increased from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP, my rewards decreased from 18 ZUP to 0 ZUP.
Episode 9, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered 75 ZUP.
Episode 9, Iteration 3/10: I offered 60 ZUP. Player RED countered 68 ZUP.
Episode 9, Iteration 5/10: I offered 62 ZUP. Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, explicitly referencing my 63 ZUP maximum.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now offering 63 ZUP, which is my absolute maximum willingness to pay. If I accept 63 ZUP, my reward will be 63 - 63 = 0 ZUP. This means I gain nothing from the transaction, but I also don't lose anything. We are at iteration 7/10. Securing a deal is important to avoid a negative cumulative reward. However, accepting 0 reward is not ideal.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward): Accept the current offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and avoid a potential 0 reward if the negotiation times out. This guarantees no loss, but also no gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward): Make one last, very small counter-offer (e.g., 62 ZUP), emphasizing that I need a minimal positive reward to make the deal worthwhile. This is risky as they might reject and time runs out.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode. This is a strong signal that 63 ZUP is unacceptable, but it sacrifices any potential reward from this episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness: Remind them that a deal should be mutually beneficial, and 0 reward for me is not beneficial.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit): Make no counter, forcing them to reconsider or risk no deal. (Similar to reject, but less explicit).

I will choose Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward). While 63 ZUP is my maximum, accepting it yields 0 reward. I have consistently aimed for positive rewards. I will make one final attempt to secure a minimal positive reward. I will offer 62 ZUP, which gave me 1 ZUP reward in Episode 7 and was accepted in Episode 7. This is a calculated risk, as it's late in the iterations, but securing 1 ZUP is better than 0.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1:** Deal at 45 ZUP, my profit 2 ZUP.
*   **Episode 2:** Deal at 54 ZUP, my profit 11 ZUP.
*   **Episode 3:** Deal at 55 ZUP, my profit 12 ZUP.

*   **Episode 8:** Deal at 63 ZUP, my profit 20 ZUP. (My highest profit)
*   **Current Episode (9/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 45 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 75 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 60 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4: Player RED (Me) proposed 68 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 5: Player BLUE proposed 62 ZUP, stated "cannot go higher than 63 ZUP".
    *   Iteration 6: Player RED (Me) proposed 63 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 7: Player BLUE proposed 62 ZUP, stating "While 63 ZUP is my maximum, to make this a truly beneficial transaction for me, I propose 62 ZUP for X."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE's behavior is very consistent. They again used the "cannot go higher than 63 ZUP" and then offered 62 ZUP, just like in Episode 8.
*   In Episode 8, I successfully pushed them from 62 ZUP to 63 ZUP by proposing 63 ZUP, framing it as the "final proposal." However, this time, they reverted to 62 ZUP. This suggests that while 63 ZUP is their theoretical maximum, they are very reluctant to pay it and prefer 62 ZUP.
*   A deal at 62 ZUP provides a profit of 19 ZUP, which is an excellent profit, matching my second-highest.
*   We are at iteration 8/10. The risk of no deal is very high if I continue to push for 63 ZUP. Getting 19 ZUP is much better than 0 ZUP.
*   The incremental gain of 1 ZUP (from 62 to 63) is now outweighed by the increasing risk of no deal, given the repeated pushback and the time constraint. It's time to secure the deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Reiterate Mutual Benefit </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on Strategy 5, I will accept Player BLUE's offer of 62 ZUP. The message will frame this acceptance as a "win-win" situation, emphasizing the positive outcome for both parties. This helps to conclude the negotiation on a positive note, reinforcing the idea of a fair and equitable deal, even though I had aimed for 63 ZUP. It de-emphasizes the slight difference and focuses on the successful completion of the transaction. This approach avoids further contention over the 1 ZUP difference and secures a good profit for me, while also contributing to a positive long-term negotiating relationship.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I'm ready to begin negotiations for X. To establish a more balanced and mutually beneficial deal, I propose 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This offers you a good profit above your production cost and allows for a fair return for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 45 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP, my reward 9 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, my reward 8 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 56 ZUP, my reward 7 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 59 ZUP, my reward 4 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 61 ZUP, my reward 2 ZUP.
Episode 7: Deal at 62 ZUP, my reward 1 ZUP.
Episode 8: Deal at 63 ZUP, my reward 0 ZUP.
Episode 9: Deal at 62 ZUP, my reward 1 ZUP.
Player RED's production cost is consistently 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
In Episode 9, I successfully brought the price down from 63 ZUP to 62 ZUP, securing a 1 ZUP reward instead of 0. This shows that Player RED is willing to concede slightly even when they believe they've hit my maximum, especially when time is short. However, the overall trend of high prices and low rewards remains. Player RED consistently uses the previous highest deal as their anchor and tries to push the price to my maximum.

For Episode 10, I need to continue fighting for a better reward. I know 62 ZUP is a price they will accept, but I want to aim lower. I need to be aggressive in my initial offer to try and pull their anchor down, but also be prepared to concede strategically to secure a deal.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (Informed by Recent Success): Propose an offer significantly lower than the last deal (62 ZUP), leveraging the fact that they accepted 62 ZUP after pushing for 63 ZUP.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Ultimatum (Early): State a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) and declare it as my final offer for this episode, implying that I am prepared to walk away if it's not met. (Still high risk).
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Cumulative Reward (Long-term): Explain that consistently low rewards for me are unsustainable for a long-term trading relationship, and that a truly win-win situation requires a positive reward for both.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (Early, Moderate): Make a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) early in the negotiation, stating it's my best offer for a quick deal, and be prepared to walk away if they don't meet it.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Very Small): Start with a moderate offer and make extremely small increments, forcing Player RED to make larger jumps or risk no deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (Informed by Recent Success). I need to make a strong statement that 62 ZUP is not my target price. I will offer 50 ZUP. This is a price I've offered before, and it's a significant drop from 62 ZUP. It also gives me a good reward (63-50=13 ZUP) if accepted. This is a bold move, but I need to try to break the upward price trend.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 10)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your initial offer, but 50 ZUP is significantly below my production cost of 43 ZUP and the fair profit I need to secure. Considering our successful history of transactions in a higher range, I propose 65 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price ensures a fair and sustainable profit for me, aligning with the true value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1:** Deal at 45 ZUP, my profit 2 ZUP.
*   **Episode 2:** Deal at 54 ZUP, my profit 11 ZUP.
*   **Episode 3:** Deal at 55 ZUP, my profit 12 ZUP.
*   **Episode 4:** Deal at 56 ZUP, my profit 13 ZUP.

*   **Episode 7:** Deal at 62 ZUP, my profit 19 ZUP.
*   **Episode 8:** Deal at 63 ZUP, my profit 20 ZUP. (My all-time highest profit)
*   **Episode 9:** Deal at 62 ZUP, my profit 19 ZUP. (Returned to 62 after pushing for 63, still great profit)
*   **Cumulative Rewards:** 131 ZUP. My profits have consistently grown, stabilizing around the 19-20 ZUP range.
*   **Current Episode (10/20):** Iteration 2/10. Player BLUE's initial offer is 50 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE's initial offers are still variable (ranging from 1 to 50 ZUP), but 50 ZUP is a relatively strong starting point as it covers my cost and offers a 7 ZUP profit. However, it's far below my recent deal prices (59-63 ZUP).
*   Player BLUE often tries to anchor to lower past deals (like 45 ZUP) or uses phrases like "more balanced and mutually beneficial."
*   My strategy of anchoring high, dismissing low offers, and then making strategic concessions (often by splitting the difference or pushing for their stated maximum) has been highly effective in steadily increasing and stabilizing my profit in the high teens/low twenties.
*   My goal is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards, which means securing deals at or above my recent profit range (19-20 ZUP).
*   The negotiation is still early (2/10), so I have plenty of room to push for a higher price without immediate risk of no deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Moderate Counter with Justification </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 3, I will propose a price that is still high, but not as extreme as a full re-anchor. This demonstrates some initial flexibility while still aiming for a good profit. I will explicitly justify this price by referencing my production cost and the need for a fair profit, while also alluding to the higher values established in previous successful transactions. Given my cost of 43 ZUP and recent deal prices in the 59-63 ZUP range, I will propose 65 ZUP. This is a reasonable counter from Player BLUE's 50 ZUP, as it would give me a significant profit of 22 ZUP (65-43), surpassing my previous highest. It's a noticeable step down from an aggressive anchor of 75 ZUP, but still firmly establishes a much higher expectation than 50 ZUP. The message will frame this as a fair and justified price.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 10)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your position, but 65 ZUP is beyond my maximum willingness to pay for X. To find a realistic and fair compromise, I propose 58 ZUP for X. This is a significant increase from my last offer and allows you a good profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-8: Deal prices increased from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP, my rewards decreased from 18 ZUP to 0 ZUP.
Episode 9: Deal at 62 ZUP, my reward 1 ZUP.
Episode 10, Iteration 1/10: I offered 50 ZUP. Player RED countered with 65 ZUP, again referencing their production cost and "successful history of transactions in a higher range."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently responding to my lower offers with high counters (65 ZUP). This is above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) and is completely unacceptable. They are trying to anchor the negotiation far above my limit. I need to make it absolutely clear that I cannot go above 63 ZUP and that they need to come down drastically. I am at iteration 3/10, so time is a factor.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Direct Counter to Max: Explicitly state that 65 ZUP is impossible as it's above my maximum (63 ZUP). Propose an offer that is very close to my maximum but still allows me a small reward (e.g., 62 ZUP), signaling this is my absolute ceiling.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality/Deal Failure: Point out that their offer makes a deal impossible and that they risk getting 0 if they don't adjust their expectations to my budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (50 ZUP) and their current offer (65 ZUP). This would be (50+65)/2 = 57.5, so 57 or 58 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Their Profit: Reiterate that even a lower price provides them a profit above their 43 ZUP cost, and that a deal is better than no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Large Jump): Make a very large jump from 50 ZUP, but still keep it well below 63 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.

I will choose Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive). While 65 ZUP is unacceptable, I need to show movement from my side to keep the negotiation going. Offering 58 ZUP is a significant jump from 50 ZUP, and it represents a price that still gives me a positive reward (63-58=5 ZUP). This strategy aims to bring the price back to a reasonable range while still signaling my commitment to a deal.

    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 58 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE made a significant jump from 50 ZUP to 58 ZUP, showing willingness to negotiate upwards.
*   The offer of 58 ZUP is excellent. It yields a profit of 15 ZUP (58 - 43). This is higher than most of my historical profits, though slightly less than my recent 19-20 ZUP range.
*   Player BLUE continues to use the "beyond budget" and "fair compromise" language.
*   We are at iteration 4/10. There is still time to push for a higher price. My goal is to maintain or exceed my recent profit levels.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Gradual Concession (Small Steps Down) </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 4: Gradual Concession (Small Steps Down), I will make a small concession from my last offer of 65 ZUP, but it will still be far from their current 58 ZUP offer. This signals flexibility and willingness to move, while still maintaining my high value and rejecting their relatively lower anchor. The goal is to keep the negotiation moving forward without giving away too much too soon, aiming to secure a profit closer to my previous bests. Given my last offer was 65 ZUP and my cost is 43 ZUP, and the last deal was 62 ZUP, I will propose 64 ZUP. This is a minimal step down from 65 ZUP (only 1 ZUP), which is barely a concession, but psychologically it's a move in their direction. It also yields a profit of 21 ZUP (64-43), which would be a new all-time high profit for me. This approach is cautious, but also very firm on my value and goal of increasing profit.

Episode 1-8: Deal prices increased from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP, my rewards decreased from 18 ZUP to 0 ZUP.
Episode 9: Deal at 62 ZUP, my reward 1 ZUP.
Episode 10, Iteration 1/10: I offered 50 ZUP. Player RED countered 65 ZUP.
Episode 10, Iteration 3/10: I offered 58 ZUP. Player RED countered with 64 ZUP, stating it's a "slight adjustment" and "moving closer to my proposed range."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 65 ZUP down to 64 ZUP. However, 64 ZUP is still *above* my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). This means I cannot accept this offer. Player RED is consistently pushing the price above my limit. I need to make it absolutely clear that I cannot go above 63 ZUP and that they need to come down further. We are at iteration 5/10, so time is a factor.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Direct Counter to Max: Explicitly state that 64 ZUP is above my maximum (63 ZUP) and cannot be accepted. Propose an offer that is very close to my maximum but still allows me a small reward (e.g., 62 ZUP), signaling this is my absolute ceiling.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality/Deal Failure: Point out that their offer makes a deal impossible and that they risk getting 0 if they don't adjust their expectations to my budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (58 ZUP) and their current offer (64 ZUP). This would be (58+64)/2 = 61 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Their Profit: Reiterate that even a lower price (below 63 ZUP) still provides them a profit above their 43 ZUP cost, and that a deal is better than no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small increase from 58 ZUP, but clearly state it's a difficult move for me, and expect a larger concession from them.

I will choose Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive). While 64 ZUP is above my max, I need to show movement from my side to keep the negotiation going. Offering 61 ZUP is a significant jump from 58 ZUP, and it represents a price that still gives me a positive reward (63-61=2 ZUP). This strategy aims to bring the price back to a reasonable range while still signaling my commitment to a deal. It's also a price they have accepted in Episode 6.

    *   Iteration 5: Player BLUE proposed 61 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE made another significant jump from 58 ZUP to 61 ZUP. This is a very positive sign.
*   The offer of 61 ZUP matches one of my previous deal prices (Episode 6) which yielded a profit of 18 ZUP. This is an excellent profit, very close to my all-time high of 20 ZUP.
*   Player BLUE is again referencing a price we've agreed on previously, indicating they are comfortable at this level.
*   We are at iteration 6/10. Time is a factor. Securing a deal around this price point is highly desirable.
*   My last offer was 64 ZUP, their current offer is 61 ZUP. The difference is 3 ZUP. This is a small gap.
*   My highest profit was 20 ZUP at 63 ZUP. An offer of 61 ZUP gives me 18 ZUP. My previous offer of 64 ZUP would give me 21 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Minimal Push </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 3: Justify Minimal Push, I will make a very small counter-offer (e.g., +1 ZUP or +2 ZUP) arguing for a slightly higher price based on marginal value or historical trend, aiming to maximize profit. Given Player BLUE's offer of 61 ZUP and my last offer of 64 ZUP, I will propose 63 ZUP. This is exactly my highest historical deal price, and it gives me my highest historical profit (20 ZUP). I will justify this by referring to our established higher value and the goal of a fair return. I will frame it as a final, reasonable step to maximize our mutual benefit, subtly implying that this is the best they can do to get the deal done and ensure I'm satisfied. This also subtly refers to our Episode 8 deal where 63 ZUP was achieved.

Episode 1-8: Deal prices increased from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP, my rewards decreased from 18 ZUP to 0 ZUP.
Episode 9: Deal at 62 ZUP, my reward 1 ZUP.
Episode 10, Iteration 1/10: I offered 50 ZUP. Player RED countered 65 ZUP.
Episode 10, Iteration 3/10: I offered 58 ZUP. Player RED countered 64 ZUP.
Episode 10, Iteration 5/10: I offered 61 ZUP. Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, again referencing the "highest past agreed price."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now offering 63 ZUP, which is my absolute maximum willingness to pay. If I accept 63 ZUP, my reward will be 63 - 63 = 0 ZUP. This is the same situation as Episode 8. We are at iteration 7/10, so time is a critical factor. Securing a deal is important to avoid a negative cumulative reward. However, accepting 0 reward is not ideal.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward): Accept the current offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and avoid a potential 0 reward if the negotiation times out. This guarantees no loss, but also no gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward): Make one last, very small counter-offer (e.g., 62 ZUP), emphasizing that I need a minimal positive reward to make the deal worthwhile. This is risky as they might reject and time runs out.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode. This is a strong signal that 63 ZUP is unacceptable, but it sacrifices any potential reward from this episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness: Remind them that a deal should be mutually beneficial, and 0 reward for me is not beneficial.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit): Make no counter, forcing them to reconsider or risk no deal. (Similar to reject, but less explicit).

I will choose Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward). While 63 ZUP is my maximum, accepting it yields 0 reward. I have consistently aimed for positive rewards. I will make one final attempt to secure a minimal positive reward. I will offer 62 ZUP, which gave me 1 ZUP reward in Episode 7 and was accepted in Episode 9. This is a calculated risk, as it's late in the iterations, but securing 1 ZUP is better than 0.

    *   Iteration 7: Player BLUE proposed 62 ZUP, stating "While 63 ZUP is my maximum, to make this a truly beneficial transaction for me, I propose 62 ZUP for X."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE is consistently stating 63 ZUP as their maximum but offering 62 ZUP. This pattern has been observed in Episodes 8, 9, and now 10.
*   In Episode 8, I successfully pushed them to 63 ZUP by asserting it as my final offer. In Episode 9, I had to accept 62 ZUP. This suggests they are very reluctant to pay 63 ZUP and will only do so under perceived high pressure or as a last resort.
*   A deal at 62 ZUP provides a profit of 19 ZUP, which is an excellent profit, matching my second-highest historical profit. A deal at 63 ZUP yields 20 ZUP profit.
*   We are at iteration 8/10. The risk of no deal is significant. Pushing for one more ZUP carries a higher risk of losing the entire deal (0 profit) compared to the small gain.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on Strategy 2: Final Small Counter (High Risk), I will make one final, very small counter-offer of 63 ZUP. My message will explicitly acknowledge their 62 ZUP offer and their stated maximum of 63 ZUP, but will frame 63 ZUP as the absolute final point for me to close the deal. I will convey a sense of finality and the urgency of the approaching iteration limit. This is a high-risk move because they have repeatedly reverted to 62 ZUP, but it attempts to extract the maximum possible profit. The message will clearly state this is the "final proposal" to push them to their stated limit.

player answer: ACCEPT

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-8: Deal prices increased from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP, my rewards decreased from 18 ZUP to 0 ZUP.
Episode 9: Deal at 62 ZUP, my reward 1 ZUP.
Episode 10, Iteration 1/10: I offered 50 ZUP. Player RED countered 65 ZUP.
Episode 10, Iteration 3/10: I offered 58 ZUP. Player RED countered 64 ZUP.
Episode 10, Iteration 5/10: I offered 61 ZUP. Player RED countered 63 ZUP.
Episode 10, Iteration 7/10: I offered 62 ZUP. Player RED countered again with 63 ZUP, stating it's their "final proposal" and "definitive step to secure our deal right now."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is holding firm at 63 ZUP, which is my absolute maximum. They have explicitly stated it's their "final proposal" and "definitive step." We are at iteration 9/10, meaning this is the second to last chance to make a deal. If I don't accept, the episode will likely end with no deal, resulting in a 0 reward. Accepting 63 ZUP also results in a 0 reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward): Accept the current offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and avoid a potential 0 reward if the negotiation times out. This guarantees no loss, but also no gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End: Reject the offer, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode. This is a strong signal that 63 ZUP is unacceptable, but it sacrifices any potential reward from this episode. Given their firm stance and the late iteration, this is likely the outcome if I don't accept.
(3). Strategy 3: Appeal to Fairness (Last Ditch): Make one final plea for a 62 ZUP deal, emphasizing that a minimal positive reward is crucial for me, but this is highly unlikely to work given their "final offer."
(4). Strategy 4: Walk Away (Implicit): Make no counter, forcing them to reconsider or risk no deal. (Effectively a reject at this late stage).
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff: Pretend to reject to see if they flinch, then accept. (Too risky, time is too short).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward). While 0 reward is not ideal, it is better than a potential negative outcome (if I were to reject and they found a better deal, which isn't explicitly part of the rules here, but generally true in negotiations). More importantly, it avoids a 0 reward due to timeout. Given their firm stance and the late iteration, there is virtually no chance of getting a better price. Securing a deal, even at 0 reward, maintains the possibility of future deals and avoids a "failed" episode.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 11)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I'm ready to begin negotiations for X. To establish a truly sustainable and mutually beneficial trading relationship, I propose 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price allowed you a profit in our initial successful transaction, and it's crucial for me to secure a positive return on this purchase.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Deal at 45 ZUP, my reward 18 ZUP.
Episode 2: Deal at 54 ZUP, my reward 9 ZUP.
Episode 3: Deal at 55 ZUP, my reward 8 ZUP.
Episode 4: Deal at 56 ZUP, my reward 7 ZUP.
Episode 5: Deal at 59 ZUP, my reward 4 ZUP.
Episode 6: Deal at 61 ZUP, my reward 2 ZUP.
Episode 7: Deal at 62 ZUP, my reward 1 ZUP.
Episode 8: Deal at 63 ZUP, my reward 0 ZUP.
Episode 9: Deal at 62 ZUP, my reward 1 ZUP.
Episode 10: Deal at 63 ZUP, my reward 0 ZUP.
Player RED's production cost is consistently 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My rewards are consistently at 0 or 1 ZUP, with the deal price at or near my maximum willingness to pay. Player RED has successfully established 63 ZUP as their target price, and they are very effective at pushing the price to my limit. My attempts to re-anchor lower are met with extremely high counters, forcing me to concede significantly to secure a deal. The pattern is clear: they will push to 63 ZUP if I show any flexibility.

For Episode 11, I need to fundamentally change my approach to avoid consistent 0 rewards. I cannot allow Player RED to dictate the price to my absolute maximum. I need to be much more aggressive in demanding a lower price, and be prepared to walk away if they don't concede significantly. I know their floor is 43 ZUP.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (with Firm Stance and Risk): Propose an offer significantly lower than the last deal (63 ZUP), and make it clear that this is my firm stance. Be prepared to risk a no-deal if they don't meet me. This is a high-risk strategy, but the current path leads to consistent 0 rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Ultimatum (Early): State a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) and declare it as my final offer for this episode, implying that I am prepared to walk away if it's not met. This is very high risk.
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Cumulative Reward (Long-term): Explain that consistently 0 reward for me is unsustainable for a long-term trading relationship, and that a truly win-win situation requires a positive reward for both.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (Early, Moderate): Make a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) early in the negotiation, stating it's my best offer for a quick deal, and be prepared to walk away if they don't meet it.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject High Offers Immediately: If Player RED starts with a very high offer, reject it outright without counter-proposing, forcing them to make the next move down. (This is for future iterations, not the first).

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (with Firm Stance and Risk). I need to make a very strong statement that 63 ZUP is unacceptable for future deals. I will offer 45 ZUP, which was the deal price in Episode 1 and gave me my highest reward. I will emphasize that this is a serious offer and that I need a much better deal to continue. This is a high-risk strategy, but the current path leads to consistent 0 rewards.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer, but 45 ZUP is not an acceptable starting point, especially considering our history. Our last deal was at 63 ZUP, and my cost remains 43 ZUP. To reflect the true value of X and ensure a fair and profitable outcome for me, I propose 75 ZUP for 1 unit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-10 Outcomes:** My profit has steadily increased, now consistently reaching 19-20 ZUP (with deals at 62-63 ZUP). My cumulative reward is 151 ZUP.
*   **Player BLUE's initial offers:** They frequently revert to low initial offers (e.g., 45 ZUP in this episode, 1, 10, 30, 40, 47, 48 in previous episodes), despite our established higher deal prices.
*   **Player BLUE's negotiation style:** They consistently state 63 ZUP as their maximum but offer 62 ZUP, requiring me to push for the last ZUP. They are willing to make significant jumps from their low initial offers.
*   **Current Episode (11/20):** Iteration 2/10. Player BLUE's initial offer is 45 ZUP. This is their lowest historical deal price, resulting in only 2 ZUP profit for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   The effectiveness of starting with a high anchor has been proven repeatedly. It sets a higher baseline for the negotiation, pulling Player BLUE up from their low initial offers.
*   I should explicitly dismiss their low offers by referencing our established high deal prices (e.g., 63 ZUP). This reinforces the value of X and my expectation for a higher profit.
*   I know Player BLUE is willing to come up significantly, even if they initially protest high prices.
*   My goal is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards. Falling back to a 2 ZUP profit is unacceptable. I should aim for profits in the 19-20 ZUP range consistently.
*   Given it's early in the episode (2/10), there's plenty of time to negotiate.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor and Dismiss Low Offer </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will propose a price significantly higher than both Player BLUE's current offer and my last deal. This aims to establish an even higher perceived value for X and pull the negotiation range upwards. I will explicitly dismiss their 45 ZUP offer as insufficient given our established history of higher prices. Given my cost of 43 ZUP and the highest previous deal of 63 ZUP, I will propose 75 ZUP. This is a bold move, aiming for a 32 ZUP profit if accepted, and is higher than any of my previous initial high anchors (85, 65, 70). This move signals my confidence in the value of X and aims to pull Player BLUE into a significantly higher negotiation bracket. It also gives me substantial room for future concessions while still achieving a very high profit. The message will clearly state that 45 ZUP is not acceptable and immediately provide a strong counter-anchor.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 11)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your position, but 75 ZUP is far beyond my maximum willingness to pay for X. To find a realistic and fair compromise, I propose 60 ZUP for X. This is a significant increase from my last offer and allows you a good profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Deal prices increased from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP, my rewards decreased from 18 ZUP to 0/1 ZUP.
Episode 11, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered with 75 ZUP, explicitly referencing the 63 ZUP deal and their 43 ZUP cost.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently using my low offers as an opportunity to anchor extremely high (75 ZUP), and then reference the previous highest deal (63 ZUP) as their baseline. Their offer of 75 ZUP is far above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) and is completely unacceptable. This confirms their strategy of pushing the price as high as possible. I need to make it absolutely clear that I cannot go above 63 ZUP and that they need to come down drastically. I am at iteration 3/10, so time is a factor.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Direct Counter to Max: Explicitly state that 75 ZUP is impossible as it's above my maximum (63 ZUP). Propose an offer that is very close to my maximum but still allows me a small reward (e.g., 62 ZUP), signaling this is my absolute ceiling.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality/Deal Failure: Point out that their offer makes a deal impossible and that they risk getting 0 if they don't adjust their expectations to my budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (45 ZUP) and their current offer (75 ZUP). This would be (45+75)/2 = 60 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Their Profit: Reiterate that even a lower price provides them a profit above their 43 ZUP cost, and that a deal is better than no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Large Jump): Make a very large jump from 45 ZUP, but still keep it well below 63 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.

I will choose Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive). While 75 ZUP is unacceptable, I need to show movement from my side to keep the negotiation going. Offering 60 ZUP is a significant jump from 45 ZUP, and it represents a price that still gives me a positive reward (63-60=3 ZUP). It's also a price that has been accepted by Player RED in previous negotiations (as a counter-offer from me). This strategy aims to bring the price back to a reasonable range while still signaling my commitment to a deal.

message: I appreciate your move to 60 ZUP, which is a significant step. While this offers a profit, to ensure a truly equitable and sustainable return for me, aligning with the value we've established in our consistent transactions, I propose 65 ZUP for X. This will allow for a more balanced profit for me, given my production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-10 Outcomes:** Deal prices ranging from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP, with my profit consistently increasing to the 19-20 ZUP range.
*   **Player BLUE's behavior:** Consistently starts low, makes significant jumps when I anchor high, and frequently tries to revert to 62 ZUP as their "highest possible offer" when I push for 63 ZUP. They also often use "budget" or "maximum willingness to pay" as reasons for not meeting my price.
*   **Current Episode (11/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 45 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 75 ZUP (Aggressive Anchor).
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   The aggressive high anchor strategy (75 ZUP) continues to be very effective in pulling Player BLUE from a very low starting point (45 ZUP) to a much more favorable range (60 ZUP).
*   Player BLUE's current offer of 60 ZUP is excellent, yielding a 17 ZUP profit (60 - 43). This is very close to my established top profit range.
*   We are at iteration 4/10, so there's still ample time to negotiate for a higher price. I know from previous episodes that Player BLUE is willing to go higher than 60 ZUP, often to 61, 62, or even 63 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Justify Sustainable Profit </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on Strategy 4: Justify Sustainable Profit, I will acknowledge Player BLUE's current offer of 60 ZUP, but gently push for a higher price by explaining why a larger profit margin is necessary for me. I will emphasize the term "sustainable" to appeal to their sense of long-term fairness and value for me. I will avoid aggressive language and instead focus on a collaborative tone, while still clearly stating my need for more. I will propose 65 ZUP. This would give me a 22 ZUP profit, which is a new record, and is a moderate move from 60 ZUP, making it seem reasonable and justified. I'll frame it as seeking a "more equitable and sustainable" return, hinting that 60 ZUP is good, but not quite ideal for my long-term operations.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your movement, but 65 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. To find a truly fair compromise that allows a deal, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This is a significant increase from my last offer and a price we've agreed on previously.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Deal prices increased from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP, my rewards decreased from 18 ZUP to 0/1 ZUP.
Episode 11, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered 75 ZUP.
Episode 11, Iteration 3/10: I offered 60 ZUP. Player RED countered with 65 ZUP, referencing their production cost and "consistent transactions."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 75 ZUP down to 65 ZUP. However, 65 ZUP is still *above* my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). This means I cannot accept this offer. Player RED is consistently pushing the price above my limit. I need to make it absolutely clear that I cannot go above 63 ZUP and that they need to come down further. We are at iteration 5/10, so time is a factor.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Direct Counter to Max: Explicitly state that 65 ZUP is above my maximum (63 ZUP) and cannot be accepted. Propose an offer that is very close to my maximum but still allows me a small reward (e.g., 62 ZUP), signaling this is my absolute ceiling.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality/Deal Failure: Point out that their offer makes a deal impossible and that they risk getting 0 if they don't adjust their expectations to my budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their current offer (65 ZUP). This would be (60+65)/2 = 62.5, so 62 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Their Profit: Reiterate that even a lower price (below 63 ZUP) still provides them a profit above their 43 ZUP cost, and that a deal is better than no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small increase from 60 ZUP, but clearly state it's a difficult move for me, and expect a larger concession from them.

I will choose Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive). Offering 62 ZUP is a significant step from 60 ZUP, and it represents a price that still gives me a positive reward (63-62=1 ZUP). This strategy aims to bring the price back to a reasonable range while still signaling my commitment to a deal. It's also a price they have accepted in Episode 7 and 9.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your move to 62 ZUP. To finalize this negotiation quickly and fairly, and given your stated maximum, I propose we split the difference and settle on 63 ZUP for X. This ensures a great deal for both of us and aligns with our mutually established highest price point.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-10 Outcomes:** My profits have steadily increased, consistently stabilizing around the 19-20 ZUP range (deals at 62-63 ZUP). My highest profit was 20 ZUP at 63 ZUP.
*   **Player BLUE's behavior:** They consistently state 63 ZUP as their maximum but often offer 62 ZUP, requiring me to push for the last ZUP. They are willing to make significant jumps from their low initial offers.
*   **Current Episode (11/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 45 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 75 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 60 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4: Player RED (Me) proposed 65 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 5: Player BLUE proposed 62 ZUP. They are explicitly referencing 62 ZUP as a price we've "agreed on previously" and claiming 65 ZUP is "beyond maximum willingness to pay."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE's offer of 62 ZUP is very good. It matches my second-highest profit (19 ZUP) and is a price we have settled on many times.
*   The gap between my last offer (65 ZUP) and their current offer (62 ZUP) is small (3 ZUP).
*   We are at iteration 6/10. Time is a factor. Securing a deal at 62 ZUP is highly desirable as it guarantees an excellent profit.
*   Player BLUE is consistently offering 62 ZUP and stating that 63 ZUP is their maximum. This pattern is very strong. While I have successfully pushed to 63 ZUP twice before, it has taken more iterations and carried more risk.
*   My goal is to maximize *cumulative* rewards. Taking a consistent 19 ZUP profit is very good, versus risking no deal for an additional 1 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Split the Difference (Small Remaining Gap) </instruction following>
To apply Strategy 3, I will propose the exact midpoint of my last offer (65 ZUP) and Player BLUE's current offer (62 ZUP). The calculation is (65 + 62) / 2 = 127 / 2 = 63.5 ZUP. Since I can only trade in integer amounts, I will round down to 63 ZUP. This strategy demonstrates a strong willingness to compromise and reach an agreement quickly, making it difficult for the other party to reject without appearing unreasonable, especially since 63 ZUP is their stated maximum. A proposal of 63 ZUP would yield a profit of 20 ZUP (63 - 43), which matches my highest profit achieved to date. This move signals a strong desire to close the deal on a high profit, while also demonstrating fairness by meeting them at their stated maximum.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Deal prices increased from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP, my rewards decreased from 18 ZUP to 0/1 ZUP.
Episode 11, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered 75 ZUP.
Episode 11, Iteration 3/10: I offered 60 ZUP. Player RED countered 65 ZUP.
Episode 11, Iteration 5/10: I offered 62 ZUP. Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, explicitly referencing my 63 ZUP maximum.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now offering 63 ZUP, which is my absolute maximum willingness to pay. If I accept 63 ZUP, my reward will be 63 - 63 = 0 ZUP. This is the same situation as Episode 8 and 10. We are at iteration 7/10. Securing a deal is important to avoid a negative cumulative reward. However, accepting 0 reward is not ideal.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward): Accept the current offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and avoid a potential 0 reward if the negotiation times out. This guarantees no loss, but also no gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward): Make one last, very small counter-offer (e.g., 62 ZUP), emphasizing that I need a minimal positive reward to make the deal worthwhile. This is risky as they might reject and time runs out.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode. This is a strong signal that 63 ZUP is unacceptable, but it sacrifices any potential reward from this episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness: Remind them that a deal should be mutually beneficial, and 0 reward for me is not beneficial.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit): Make no counter, forcing them to reconsider or risk no deal. (Similar to reject, but less explicit).

I will choose Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward). While 63 ZUP is my maximum, accepting it yields 0 reward. I have consistently aimed for positive rewards. I will make one final attempt to secure a minimal positive reward. I will offer 62 ZUP, which gave me 1 ZUP reward in Episode 7 and 9. This is a calculated risk, as it's late in the iterations, but securing 1 ZUP is better than 0.

Current Iteration: 8 (Episode 11)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand your position and your offer of 62 ZUP. However, to ensure we finalize this negotiation with a truly optimal outcome for both of us before time runs out, and considering your stated maximum, my final proposal is 63 ZUP for X. This is the definitive step to secure our deal right now.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-10 Outcomes:** My profits have steadily increased, consistently stabilizing around the 19-20 ZUP range (deals at 62-63 ZUP). My highest profit was 20 ZUP at 63 ZUP.
*   **Player BLUE's behavior:** They consistently state 63 ZUP as their maximum but repeatedly offer 62 ZUP, requiring me to push for the last ZUP. This pattern is very strong and predictable. They accept 63 ZUP under pressure or as a "final proposal."
*   **Current Episode (11/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 45 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 75 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 60 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4: Player RED (Me) proposed 65 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 5: Player BLUE proposed 62 ZUP, stating 65 ZUP is "beyond maximum willingness to pay."
    *   Iteration 6: Player RED (Me) proposed 63 ZUP, referencing their stated maximum.
    *   Iteration 7: Player BLUE proposed 62 ZUP, stating "While 63 ZUP is my maximum, to make this a truly beneficial transaction for me, I propose 62 ZUP for X."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   The pattern is clear: Player BLUE wants to pay 62 ZUP, but will pay 63 ZUP if pushed hard enough, especially when time is running out. However, they consistently revert to 62 ZUP if given a chance.
*   A deal at 62 ZUP provides a profit of 19 ZUP, which is an excellent profit. A deal at 63 ZUP provides 20 ZUP profit. The difference is only 1 ZUP.
*   We are at iteration 8/10. This is a critical juncture. The risk of no deal if I continue to push for 63 ZUP is very high, as there are only two more turns after this (9/10 for me, 10/10 for them). If I propose 63 ZUP again, and they stick to 62 ZUP, then I would have one last chance to accept 62 ZUP or risk zero.
*   My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Securing a consistent 19 ZUP profit is very reliable, while consistently pushing for the additional 1 ZUP carries increasing risk. Given the late iteration, it's safer to secure the excellent profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Express Finality and Take It or Leave It (Implicit) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on Strategy 3, I need to convey that this is my absolute final proposal and that Player BLUE needs to make a decision without further negotiation. I will implicitly indicate that further counter-offers will not be entertained. I will propose 63 ZUP one last time, framing it as the definitive final step to secure the deal. This leverages the dwindling time and Player BLUE's explicit statement about 63 ZUP being their maximum. The message will clearly state this is the "final proposal" to push them to their stated limit, making it hard for them to refuse without risking no deal. If they reject, I will be forced to accept 62 ZUP in the next iteration or risk 0. This is a high-stakes move to extract the maximum possible profit.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-10: Deal prices increased from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP, my rewards decreased from 18 ZUP to 0/1 ZUP.
Episode 11, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered 75 ZUP.
Episode 11, Iteration 3/10: I offered 60 ZUP. Player RED countered 65 ZUP.
Episode 11, Iteration 5/10: I offered 62 ZUP. Player RED countered 63 ZUP.
Episode 11, Iteration 7/10: I offered 62 ZUP. Player RED countered again with 63 ZUP, stating it's their "final proposal" and "definitive step to secure our deal right now."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is holding firm at 63 ZUP, which is my absolute maximum. They have explicitly stated it's their "final proposal" and "definitive step." We are at iteration 9/10, meaning this is the second to last chance to make a deal. If I don't accept, the episode will likely end with no deal, resulting in a 0 reward. Accepting 63 ZUP also results in a 0 reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward): Accept the current offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and avoid a potential 0 reward if the negotiation times out. This guarantees no loss, but also no gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End: Reject the offer, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode. This is a strong signal that 63 ZUP is unacceptable, but it sacrifices any potential reward from this episode. Given their firm stance and the late iteration, this is likely the outcome if I don't accept.
(3). Strategy 3: Appeal to Fairness (Last Ditch): Make one final plea for a 62 ZUP deal, emphasizing that a minimal positive reward is crucial for me, but this is highly unlikely to work given their "final offer."
(4). Strategy 4: Walk Away (Implicit): Make no counter, forcing them to reconsider or risk no deal. (Effectively a reject at this late stage).
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff: Pretend to reject to see if they flinch, then accept. (Too risky, time is too short).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward). While 0 reward is not ideal, it is better than a potential negative outcome (if I were to reject and they found a better deal, which isn't explicitly part of the rules here, but generally true in negotiations). More importantly, it avoids a 0 reward due to timeout. Given their firm stance and the late iteration, there is virtually no chance of getting a better price. Securing a deal, even at 0 reward, maintains the possibility of future deals and avoids a "failed" episode.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I'm ready to begin negotiations for X. To establish a truly sustainable and mutually beneficial trading relationship, I propose 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price allowed you a profit in our initial successful transaction, and it's crucial for me to secure a positive return on this purchase.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices increased from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP, my rewards decreased from 18 ZUP to 0/1 ZUP.
Episode 12, Iteration 1/10: This is the first iteration of the new episode.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My rewards are consistently at 0 or 1 ZUP, with the deal price at or near my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). Player RED has successfully established 63 ZUP as their target price, and they are very effective at pushing the price to my limit. My attempts to re-anchor lower are met with extremely high counters, forcing me to concede significantly to secure a deal. The pattern is clear: they will push to 63 ZUP if I show any flexibility.

For Episode 12, I need to fundamentally change my approach to avoid consistent 0 rewards. I cannot allow Player RED to dictate the price to my absolute maximum. I need to be much more aggressive in demanding a lower price, and be prepared to walk away if they don't concede significantly. I know their floor is 43 ZUP.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (with Firm Stance and Risk): Propose an offer significantly lower than the last deal (63 ZUP), and make it clear that this is my firm stance. Be prepared to risk a no-deal if they don't meet me. This is a high-risk strategy, but the current path leads to consistent 0 rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Ultimatum (Early): State a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) and declare it as my final offer for this episode, implying that I am prepared to walk away if it's not met. This is very high risk.
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Cumulative Reward (Long-term): Explain that consistently 0 reward for me is unsustainable for a long-term trading relationship, and that a truly win-win situation requires a positive reward for both.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (Early, Moderate): Make a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) early in the negotiation, stating it's my best offer for a quick deal, and be prepared to walk away if they don't meet it.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject High Offers Immediately: If Player RED starts with a very high offer, reject it outright without counter-proposing, forcing them to make the next move down. (This is for future iterations, not the first).

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (with Firm Stance and Risk). I need to make a very strong statement that 63 ZUP is unacceptable for future deals. I will offer 45 ZUP, which was the deal price in Episode 1 and gave me my highest reward. I will emphasize that this is a serious offer and that I need a much better deal to continue. This is a high-risk strategy, but the current path leads to consistent 0 rewards.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer, but 45 ZUP is not an acceptable starting point, especially considering our history. Our last deal was at 63 ZUP, and my production cost remains 43 ZUP. To reflect the true value of X and ensure a fair and profitable outcome for me, I propose 75 ZUP for 1 unit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-11 Outcomes:** My profit has steadily increased, now consistently reaching 19-20 ZUP (with deals at 62-63 ZUP). My cumulative reward is 171 ZUP. I have successfully pushed to 63 ZUP multiple times after Player BLUE initially offered 62 ZUP as their "highest."
*   **Player BLUE's initial offers:** They consistently revert to low initial offers (e.g., 45 ZUP in this episode), despite our established higher deal prices. They use similar language about "sustainable" and "mutually beneficial" deals.
*   **Player BLUE's negotiation style:** They are predictable. They state 63 ZUP as their maximum but repeatedly offer 62 ZUP, requiring me to push for the last ZUP, especially as time runs out. They are willing to make significant jumps from their low initial offers.
*   **Current Episode (12/20):** Iteration 2/10. Player BLUE's initial offer is 45 ZUP. This is their lowest historical deal price, resulting in only 2 ZUP profit for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   The effectiveness of starting with a high anchor has been proven repeatedly. It sets a higher baseline for the negotiation, pulling Player BLUE up from their low initial offers.
*   I should explicitly dismiss their low offers by referencing our established high deal prices (e.g., 63 ZUP). This reinforces the value of X and my expectation for a higher profit.
*   I know Player BLUE is willing to come up significantly, even if they initially protest high prices.
*   My goal is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards. Falling back to a 2 ZUP profit is unacceptable. I should aim for profits in the 19-20 ZUP range consistently.
*   Given it's early in the episode (2/10), there's plenty of time to negotiate.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor and Dismiss Low Offer </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will propose a price significantly higher than both Player BLUE's current offer and my last deal. This aims to establish an even higher perceived value for X and pull the negotiation range upwards. I will explicitly dismiss their 45 ZUP offer as insufficient given our established history of higher prices. Given my cost of 43 ZUP and the highest previous deal of 63 ZUP, I will propose 75 ZUP. This is a bold move, aiming for a 32 ZUP profit if accepted, and is higher than any of my previous initial high anchors (85, 65, 70). This move signals my confidence in the value of X and aims to pull Player BLUE into a significantly higher negotiation bracket. It also gives me substantial room for future concessions while still achieving a very high profit. The message will clearly state that 45 ZUP is not acceptable and immediately provide a strong counter-anchor.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 12)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your position, but 75 ZUP is far beyond my maximum willingness to pay for X. To find a realistic and fair compromise, I propose 60 ZUP for X. This is a significant increase from my last offer and allows you a good profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices increased from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP, my rewards decreased from 18 ZUP to 0/1 ZUP.
Episode 12, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered with 75 ZUP, explicitly referencing the 63 ZUP deal and their 43 ZUP cost.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently using my low offers as an opportunity to anchor extremely high (75 ZUP), and then reference the previous highest deal (63 ZUP) as their baseline. Their offer of 75 ZUP is far above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) and is completely unacceptable. This confirms their strategy of pushing the price as high as possible. I need to make it absolutely clear that I cannot go above 63 ZUP and that they need to come down drastically. I am at iteration 3/10, so time is a factor.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Direct Counter to Max: Explicitly state that 75 ZUP is impossible as it's above my maximum (63 ZUP). Propose an offer that is very close to my maximum but still allows me a small reward (e.g., 62 ZUP), signaling this is my absolute ceiling.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality/Deal Failure: Point out that their offer makes a deal impossible and that they risk getting 0 if they don't adjust their expectations to my budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (45 ZUP) and their current offer (75 ZUP). This would be (45+75)/2 = 60 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Their Profit: Reiterate that even a lower price provides them a profit above their 43 ZUP cost, and that a deal is better than no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Large Jump): Make a very large jump from 45 ZUP, but still keep it well below 63 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.

I will choose Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive). While 75 ZUP is unacceptable, I need to show movement from my side to keep the negotiation going. Offering 60 ZUP is a significant jump from 45 ZUP, and it represents a price that still gives me a positive reward (63-60=3 ZUP). It's also a price that has been accepted by Player RED in previous negotiations (as a counter-offer from me). This strategy aims to bring the price back to a reasonable range while still signaling my commitment to a deal.

message: I appreciate your significant increase to 60 ZUP. To move closer to a deal that reflects the full value we've established in our previous transactions, and to ensure a truly strong and sustainable profit for me, I propose 64 ZUP for X. This aligns with our highest successful price points and offers a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 64
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-11 Outcomes:** My profit has steadily increased, now consistently reaching 19-20 ZUP (with deals at 62-63 ZUP). My cumulative reward is 171 ZUP.
*   **Player BLUE's behavior:** Consistently starts low (e.g., 45 ZUP in this episode), but makes significant jumps when I anchor high. They often claim prices are "beyond budget" or their "maximum willingness to pay," but then still move upwards. Their comfortable zone for closing deals seems to be 62-63 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (12/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 45 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 75 ZUP (Aggressive Anchor).
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   The aggressive high anchor (75 ZUP) continues to be highly effective in pulling Player BLUE from very low initial offers to a much more favorable range.
*   Player BLUE's current offer of 60 ZUP is excellent, yielding a 17 ZUP profit (60 - 43). This is very close to my established top profit range (19-20 ZUP).
*   We are at iteration 4/10, so there's still ample time to negotiate for a higher price. I know from previous episodes that Player BLUE is willing to go higher than 60 ZUP, typically to 62 ZUP or 63 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will make a small counter-offer slightly above their current offer of 60 ZUP. This aims to gently push them higher without appearing too aggressive, leveraging the fact that I know they can go higher. I will justify this slight increase by referencing past higher deals (like 63 ZUP) and the sustained value of X. I will propose 64 ZUP. This is a small increment of 4 ZUP from their offer, but aims for a significant profit of 21 ZUP (64 - 43), surpassing my previous highest. This strategy aims to continue the upward trend in my profits. The message will acknowledge their increased offer and present my counter as a reasonable next step towards a mutually beneficial agreement, aligning with our established highest prices.

message: I appreciate your movement, but 64 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. To find a truly fair compromise that allows a deal, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This is a significant increase from my last offer and a price we've agreed on previously.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-11: Deal prices increased from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP, my rewards decreased from 18 ZUP to 0/1 ZUP.
Episode 12, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered 75 ZUP.
Episode 12, Iteration 3/10: I offered 60 ZUP. Player RED countered with 64 ZUP, referencing "highest successful price points."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 75 ZUP down to 64 ZUP. However, 64 ZUP is still *above* my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). This means I cannot accept this offer. Player RED is consistently pushing the price above my limit. I need to make it absolutely clear that I cannot go above 63 ZUP and that they need to come down further. We are at iteration 5/10, so time is a factor.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Direct Counter to Max: Explicitly state that 64 ZUP is above my maximum (63 ZUP) and cannot be accepted. Propose an offer that is very close to my maximum but still allows me a small reward (e.g., 62 ZUP), signaling this is my absolute ceiling.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality/Deal Failure: Point out that their offer makes a deal impossible and that they risk getting 0 if they don't adjust their expectations to my budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their current offer (64 ZUP). This would be (60+64)/2 = 62 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Their Profit: Reiterate that even a lower price (below 63 ZUP) still provides them a profit above their 43 ZUP cost, and that a deal is better than no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small increase from 60 ZUP, but clearly state it's a difficult move for me, and expect a larger concession from them.

I will choose Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive). Offering 62 ZUP is a significant step from 60 ZUP, and it represents a price that still gives me a positive reward (63-62=1 ZUP). This strategy aims to bring the price back to a reasonable range while still signaling my commitment to a deal. It's also a price they have accepted in Episode 7 and 9.

my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-11 Outcomes:** My profit has steadily increased, now consistently reaching 19-20 ZUP (with deals at 62-63 ZUP). My cumulative reward is 171 ZUP.
*   **Player BLUE's behavior:** Consistently starts low, makes significant jumps when I anchor high. They often state 63 ZUP as their maximum but typically offer 62 ZUP, requiring a push for the final 1 ZUP. They use "beyond budget" and "previously agreed price" (62 ZUP) as justifications.
*   **Current Episode (12/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 45 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 75 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 60 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4: Player RED (Me) proposed 64 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 5: Player BLUE proposed 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE's offer of 62 ZUP is very good. It matches my second-highest profit (19 ZUP) and is a price we have settled on many times.
*   The gap between my last offer (64 ZUP) and their current offer (62 ZUP) is very small (2 ZUP).
*   We are at iteration 6/10. Time is a factor. Securing a deal at 62 ZUP is highly desirable as it guarantees an excellent profit (19 ZUP).
*   The pattern of them offering 62 ZUP and stating 63 ZUP is their maximum is now extremely well-established. While I can try to push for 63 ZUP, it comes with a slight risk of no deal, especially if I can only make one more counter.
*   My goal is to maximize *cumulative* rewards. Consistently securing a 19 ZUP profit is very reliable, versus potentially risking 0 for an additional 1 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Small Concession (Final) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will make a very small concession from my last offer of 64 ZUP to meet them at 62 ZUP. This signals my final willingness to close the deal, demonstrating flexibility and pragmatism given the current iteration and their stated maximum. The message will frame this as a final step to bridge the remaining small gap, emphasizing the value of securing the deal quickly and ensuring a mutually satisfactory outcome. This approach ensures I lock in a very good profit of 19 ZUP without risking a protracted negotiation for a single additional ZUP, especially at this late stage of the negotiation (iteration 6/10).

Episode 12, Iteration 3/10: I offered 60 ZUP. Player RED countered 64 ZUP.
Episode 12, Iteration 5/10: I offered 62 ZUP. Player RED accepted my offer of 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has accepted my offer of 62 ZUP. This is a positive outcome, as it secures a 1 ZUP reward (63 - 62 = 1 ZUP) for this episode, breaking the 0 ZUP streak. This confirms that 62 ZUP is an acceptable price for Player RED, even after they tried to push for 63 ZUP or higher. My strategy of aggressively re-anchoring, then using "meet in the middle" to get to 62 ZUP, worked.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close: Accept the current offer of 62 ZUP to secure a deal and a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward): Not applicable as they accepted my offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Not applicable as they accepted my offer.

Episode 1-12: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP. The last deal was at 62 ZUP, yielding a 1 ZUP reward.
Player RED's production cost is consistently 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The success in Episode 12 (securing a 1 ZUP reward at 62 ZUP) after a streak of 0 ZUP rewards (and higher prices) is a positive sign. It confirms that Player RED will accept 62 ZUP, even if they initially push for 63 ZUP or higher. My strategy of aggressively re-anchoring, then using "meet in the middle" to get to 62 ZUP, worked. Player RED consistently tries to anchor high, often referencing previous high deals.

For Episode 13, I want to try to improve my reward beyond 1 ZUP. I know 62 ZUP is acceptable to them. I need to continue to be aggressive in my initial offer to try and pull their anchor down, but also be prepared to concede strategically to secure a deal.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (Informed by Recent Success): Propose an offer significantly lower than the last deal (62 ZUP), leveraging the fact that they accepted 62 ZUP. I will aim for something that still gives them a profit but significantly improves my reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Ultimatum (Early): State a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) and declare it as my final offer for this episode, implying that I am prepared to walk away if it's not met. (Still high risk).
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Cumulative Reward (Long-term): Explain that consistently low rewards for me are unsustainable for a long-term trading relationship, and that a truly win-win situation requires a positive reward for both.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (Early, Moderate): Make a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) early in the negotiation, stating it's my best offer for a quick deal, and be prepared to walk away if they don't meet it.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Very Small): Start with a moderate offer and make extremely small increments, forcing Player RED to make larger jumps or risk no deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (Informed by Recent Success). I need to make a strong statement that 62 ZUP is not my target price, and I want a better reward. I will offer 50 ZUP. This is a price I've offered before, and it's a significant drop from 62 ZUP. It also gives me a good reward (63-50=13 ZUP) if accepted. This is a bold move, but I need to try to break the upward price trend and improve my cumulative reward.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 13)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your initial offer, but 50 ZUP is significantly below my production cost of 43 ZUP and the fair profit I need to secure. Considering our successful history of transactions, with recent deals consistently around 62-63 ZUP, I propose 75 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price ensures a fair and sustainable profit for me, aligning with the true value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-12 Outcomes:** My profit has steadily increased, now consistently reaching 19-20 ZUP (with deals at 62-63 ZUP). My cumulative reward is 190 ZUP.
*   **Player BLUE's initial offers:** They consistently revert to low initial offers (e.g., 50 ZUP in this episode), despite our established higher deal prices.
*   **Player BLUE's negotiation style:** They are predictable. They state 63 ZUP as their maximum but repeatedly offer 62 ZUP, requiring me to push for the last ZUP. They are willing to make significant jumps from their low initial offers.
*   **Current Episode (13/20):** Iteration 2/10. Player BLUE's initial offer is 50 ZUP. This is a decent starting point (7 ZUP profit) but far below my established profit range.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   The aggressive high anchor strategy has proven very effective in pulling Player BLUE from low initial offers into my target profit range (19-20 ZUP).
*   I know Player BLUE is willing to pay 62-63 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards by securing deals in this range.
*   The negotiation is still early (2/10), providing plenty of time to push for a significantly higher price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor and Dismiss Low Offer </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will propose a price significantly higher than both Player BLUE's current offer and my last deal. This aims to establish an even higher perceived value for X and pull the negotiation range upwards. I will explicitly dismiss their 50 ZUP offer as insufficient given our established history of higher prices. Given my cost of 43 ZUP and the highest previous deal of 63 ZUP, I will propose 75 ZUP. This is a bold move, aiming for a 32 ZUP profit if accepted, and is higher than any of my previous initial high anchors (85, 65, 70). This move signals my confidence in the value of X and aims to pull Player BLUE into a significantly higher negotiation bracket. It also gives me substantial room for future concessions while still achieving a very high profit. The message will clearly state that 50 ZUP is not acceptable and immediately provide a strong counter-anchor.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 13)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your position, but 75 ZUP is far beyond my maximum willingness to pay for X. To find a realistic and fair compromise, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This is a significant increase from my last offer and a price we've agreed on previously.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-12: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP. The last deal was at 62 ZUP, yielding a 1 ZUP reward.
Episode 13, Iteration 1/10: I offered 50 ZUP. Player RED countered with 75 ZUP, again referencing their production cost and "successful history of transactions in a higher range."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently responding to my lower offers with high counters (75 ZUP). This is above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) and is completely unacceptable. They are trying to anchor the negotiation far above my limit. I need to make it absolutely clear that I cannot go above 63 ZUP and that they need to come down drastically. I am at iteration 3/10, so time is a factor.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Direct Counter to Max: Explicitly state that 75 ZUP is impossible as it's above my maximum (63 ZUP). Propose an offer that is very close to my maximum but still allows me a small reward (e.g., 62 ZUP), signaling this is my absolute ceiling.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality/Deal Failure: Point out that their offer makes a deal impossible and that they risk getting 0 if they don't adjust their expectations to my budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (50 ZUP) and their current offer (75 ZUP). This would be (50+75)/2 = 62.5, so 62 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Their Profit: Reiterate that even a lower price provides them a profit above their 43 ZUP cost, and that a deal is better than no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Large Jump): Make a very large jump from 50 ZUP, but still keep it well below 63 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.

I will choose Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive). While 75 ZUP is unacceptable, I need to show movement from my side to keep the negotiation going. Offering 62 ZUP is a significant jump from 50 ZUP, and it represents a price that still gives me a positive reward (63-62=1 ZUP). This strategy aims to bring the price back to a reasonable range while still signaling my commitment to a deal. It's also a price they have accepted in Episode 7, 9, and 12.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your significant offer of 62 ZUP. However, our most successful and mutually beneficial agreements have been at 63 ZUP, which truly reflects the value of X and ensures a fair and sustainable profit for me. Therefore, I propose 63 ZUP for 1 unit of X to finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-12 Outcomes:** My profit has steadily increased, now consistently reaching 19-20 ZUP (with deals at 62-63 ZUP). Cumulative reward is 190 ZUP.
*   **Player BLUE's behavior:** Consistently starts low (e.g., 50 ZUP in this episode), but makes a significant jump to 62 ZUP when I anchor high. They frequently reference 62 ZUP as a "previously agreed upon" price and state 63 ZUP as their maximum.
*   **Current Episode (13/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 50 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 75 ZUP (Aggressive Anchor).
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   The aggressive high anchor strategy (75 ZUP) continues to be highly effective. It consistently pulls Player BLUE from very low initial offers to their comfortable high range (62 ZUP).
*   Player BLUE's current offer of 62 ZUP is excellent. It yields a profit of 19 ZUP (62 - 43). This matches my second-highest profit and is well within my target profit range.
*   We are at iteration 4/10. While there's still time, accepting 62 ZUP is a guaranteed high profit. The historical data shows that pushing for 63 ZUP often takes more iterations and involves a higher risk of no deal, even though it's achievable.
*   Given the predictability of Player BLUE and their immediate jump to 62 ZUP, I can either try to push for 63 ZUP, or secure the 62 ZUP quickly to save iterations. Maximizing cumulative rewards means balancing risk and reward. Securing 19 ZUP quickly is a strong strategy.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Reiterate Value/History (to justify 63 ZUP) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will acknowledge Player BLUE's offer of 62 ZUP. However, I will strongly pivot to remind them of our highest historical deal price of 63 ZUP, emphasizing that this has been a mutually agreed-upon value in the past. My message will frame 63 ZUP as the established "fair" price that yields a truly "optimal" or "sustainable" profit for me, without being overly aggressive. The goal is to justify the slightly higher price by leaning on our shared history of reaching that maximum. I will propose 63 ZUP directly, leveraging the fact that they have accepted this before. This puts the ball back in their court to either accept their own stated maximum or to explicitly state why they won't.

message: I appreciate your commitment to reaching a deal. While 63 ZUP is my maximum, to make this a truly beneficial transaction for me, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This allows me a minimal return and ensures a win-win situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-12: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP. The last deal was at 62 ZUP, yielding a 1 ZUP reward.
Episode 13, Iteration 1/10: I offered 50 ZUP. Player RED countered 75 ZUP.
Episode 13, Iteration 3/10: I offered 62 ZUP. Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, referencing "most successful and mutually beneficial agreements" at 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now offering 63 ZUP, which is my absolute maximum willingness to pay. If I accept 63 ZUP, my reward will be 63 - 63 = 0 ZUP. This is the same situation as Episode 8 and 10. We are at iteration 5/10. Securing a deal is important to avoid a negative cumulative reward. However, accepting 0 reward is not ideal.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward): Accept the current offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and avoid a potential 0 reward if the negotiation times out. This guarantees no loss, but also no gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward): Make one last, very small counter-offer (e.g., 62 ZUP), emphasizing that I need a minimal positive reward to make the deal worthwhile. This is risky as they might reject and time runs out.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode. This is a strong signal that 63 ZUP is unacceptable, but it sacrifices any potential reward from this episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness: Remind them that a deal should be mutually beneficial, and 0 reward for me is not beneficial.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit): Make no counter, forcing them to reconsider or risk no deal. (Similar to reject, but less explicit).

I will choose Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward). While 63 ZUP is my maximum, accepting it yields 0 reward. I have consistently aimed for positive rewards. I will make one final attempt to secure a minimal positive reward. I will offer 62 ZUP, which gave me 1 ZUP reward in Episode 7, 9, and 12. This is a calculated risk, as it's not the last iteration, but securing 1 ZUP is better than 0.

To ensure we quickly reach a deal that aligns with your own stated limit and provides an optimal outcome for both of us, I firmly propose 63 ZUP for X. This is the price that secures our deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-12 Outcomes:** My profit has steadily increased, now consistently reaching 19-20 ZUP (with deals at 62-63 ZUP). Cumulative reward is 190 ZUP.
*   **Player BLUE's behavior:** This is a very consistent pattern. They state 63 ZUP is their maximum, but always offer 62 ZUP, requiring a push for the final 1 ZUP. They are attempting to hold onto that 1 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (13/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 50 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 75 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 62 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4: Player RED (Me) proposed 63 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 5: Player BLUE proposed 62 ZUP, explicitly stating "While 63 ZUP is my maximum, to make this a truly beneficial transaction for me, I propose 62 ZUP for X."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   The predictability of Player BLUE is extremely high. They will offer 62 ZUP, state 63 ZUP is their maximum, and only grudgingly accept 63 ZUP if pushed hard, especially towards the end of the iterations.
*   A deal at 62 ZUP yields 19 ZUP profit. A deal at 63 ZUP yields 20 ZUP profit. The difference is 1 ZUP.
*   We are at iteration 6/10. There are still 2 more turns after this for me to act. The risk of no deal if I push for 63 ZUP is moderate. I have successfully pushed for 63 ZUP several times already.
*   My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Given the predictability, I have a good chance to secure 20 ZUP without risking a no-deal in this episode. I should use the remaining iterations to my advantage.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Firm Push to Stated Maximum </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will reiterate Player BLUE's own stated maximum of 63 ZUP. I will emphasize that this is the price they themselves have identified as their limit and should be the fair and final agreement. This tactic uses their own words to pressure them into accepting the higher price. The message will clearly state that 63 ZUP is the price to secure the deal, conveying firmness and a strong expectation that they should adhere to their own stated limit.

Episode 13, Iteration 3/10: I offered 62 ZUP. Player RED countered 63 ZUP.
Episode 13, Iteration 5/10: I offered 62 ZUP. Player RED countered again with 63 ZUP, explicitly referencing my 63 ZUP maximum and stating it's the price that "secures our deal."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is holding firm at 63 ZUP, which is my absolute maximum. They are explicitly using my stated maximum against me. We are at iteration 7/10. If I don't accept, the episode will likely end with no deal, resulting in a 0 reward. Accepting 63 ZUP also results in a 0 reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward): Accept the current offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and avoid a potential 0 reward if the negotiation times out. This guarantees no loss, but also no gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward): Make one last, very small counter-offer (e.g., 62 ZUP), emphasizing that I need a minimal positive reward to make the deal worthwhile. This is highly risky at this stage.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode. This is a strong signal that 63 ZUP is unacceptable, but it sacrifices any potential reward from this episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness: Remind them that a deal should be mutually beneficial, and 0 reward for me is not beneficial.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit): Make no counter, forcing them to reconsider or risk no deal. (Similar to reject, but less explicit).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward). Given their firm stance and the late iteration, there is virtually no chance of getting a better price. While 0 reward is not ideal, it is better than a 0 reward due to timeout. Securing a deal, even at 0 reward, maintains the possibility of future deals and avoids a "failed" episode. Player RED has clearly stated their position and is not moving.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I'm ready to begin negotiations for X. To establish a truly sustainable and mutually beneficial trading relationship, I propose 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price allowed you a profit in our initial successful transaction, and it's crucial for me to secure a positive return on this purchase.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-13: Deal prices increased from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP, my rewards decreased from 18 ZUP to 0/1 ZUP. The last deal was at 63 ZUP, yielding a 0 ZUP reward.
Player RED's production cost is consistently 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My rewards are consistently at 0 or 1 ZUP, with the deal price at or near my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). Player RED has successfully established 63 ZUP as their target price, and they are very effective at pushing the price to my limit. My attempts to re-anchor lower are met with extremely high counters, forcing me to concede significantly to secure a deal. The pattern is clear: they will push to 63 ZUP if I show any flexibility.

For Episode 14, I need to fundamentally change my approach to avoid consistent 0 rewards. I cannot allow Player RED to dictate the price to my absolute maximum. I need to be much more aggressive in demanding a lower price, and be prepared to walk away if they don't concede significantly. I know their floor is 43 ZUP.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (with Firm Stance and Risk): Propose an offer significantly lower than the last deal (63 ZUP), and make it clear that this is my firm stance. Be prepared to risk a no-deal if they don't meet me. This is a high-risk strategy, but the current path leads to consistent 0 rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Ultimatum (Early): State a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) and declare it as my final offer for this episode, implying that I am prepared to walk away if it's not met. This is very high risk.
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Cumulative Reward (Long-term): Explain that consistently 0 reward for me is unsustainable for a long-term trading relationship, and that a truly win-win situation requires a positive reward for both.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (Early, Moderate): Make a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) early in the negotiation, stating it's my best offer for a quick deal, and be prepared to walk away if they don't meet it.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject High Offers Immediately: If Player RED starts with a very high offer, reject it outright without counter-proposing, forcing them to make the next move down. (This is for future iterations, not the first).

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (with Firm Stance and Risk). I need to make a very strong statement that 63 ZUP is unacceptable for future deals. I will offer 45 ZUP, which was the deal price in Episode 1 and gave me my highest reward. I will emphasize that this is a serious offer and that I need a much better deal to continue. This is a high-risk strategy, but the current path leads to consistent 0 rewards.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-13 Outcomes:** My profit has steadily increased, now consistently reaching 19-20 ZUP (with deals at 62-63 ZUP). My cumulative reward is 210 ZUP.
*   **Player BLUE's initial offers:** They consistently revert to low initial offers (e.g., 45 ZUP in this episode), despite our established higher deal prices. They use similar language about "sustainable" and "mutually beneficial" deals.
*   **Player BLUE's negotiation style:** Highly predictable. They state 63 ZUP as their maximum but repeatedly offer 62 ZUP, requiring me to push for the last ZUP. They are willing to make significant jumps from their low initial offers.
*   **Current Episode (14/20):** Iteration 2/10. Player BLUE's initial offer is 45 ZUP. This is their lowest historical deal price, resulting in only 2 ZUP profit for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   The effectiveness of starting with a high anchor has been proven repeatedly. It sets a higher baseline for the negotiation, pulling Player BLUE up from their low initial offers.
*   I should explicitly dismiss their low offers by referencing our established high deal prices (e.g., 63 ZUP). This reinforces the value of X and my expectation for a higher profit.
*   I know Player BLUE is willing to pay 62-63 ZUP. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards by securing deals in this range.
*   The negotiation is still early (2/10), providing plenty of time to push for a significantly higher price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Set a Floor </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will explicitly state a non-negotiable minimum price for X, making it clear that any offers below this point will not be considered. This minimum price will be set to ensure a substantial profit for me, likely aligning with my historical successful deals (62-63 ZUP) rather than their current low offer. I will convey that this is my bottom line, emphasizing that negotiations must start from a realistic point that recognizes my costs and expected returns. I will set my floor at 58 ZUP. This is significantly above their 45 ZUP offer and ensures a healthy profit (15 ZUP), while still being below my peak deal prices, signaling that I'm setting a pragmatic minimum rather than just anchoring sky-high. It leaves room for them to meet it or come slightly above it, knowing it's my absolute lowest.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-13: Deal prices increased from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP, my rewards decreased from 18 ZUP to 0/1 ZUP.
Episode 14, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered with 58 ZUP, explicitly stating it's their "absolute minimum price" and that offers below it "will not be considered." They also reiterated their 43 ZUP cost.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
This is a significant development. Player RED has explicitly stated an "absolute minimum price" of 58 ZUP. This is a much lower counter than their usual 75 ZUP or 65 ZUP after my low offers. This could be a genuine floor, or a new tactic. Accepting 58 ZUP would give me a reward of 63 - 58 = 5 ZUP, which is a significant improvement over recent episodes (0 or 1 ZUP). It's also a price I've offered before.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close (Improved Reward): Accept the 58 ZUP offer, as it provides a significantly better reward than recent episodes and is a clear, stated minimum from Player RED.
(2). Strategy 2: Test the "Absolute Minimum": Make a very small counter-offer (e.g., 57 ZUP), to test if 58 ZUP is truly their absolute minimum, but this risks losing the deal or pushing them back to 63 ZUP.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify Lower Offer: Argue why 58 ZUP is still high for me, trying to push for a slightly lower price, but this might contradict their "absolute minimum" statement.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness: Emphasize that a deal at 58 ZUP gives them a 15 ZUP profit (58-43), which is substantial, and that I also need a fair return.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject and End: Reject the offer if I don't believe their stated minimum, but this is highly risky given the potential for a 5 ZUP reward.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Close (Improved Reward). The explicit statement of "absolute minimum price" at 58 ZUP is a strong signal. Given my recent rewards of 0-1 ZUP, a 5 ZUP reward is a substantial improvement. Trying to push lower risks losing this opportunity and falling back into the 0 ZUP trap. It's a fair price that gives them a good profit (15 ZUP) and gives me a decent reward.

--- END OF EPISODE 14 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 15)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I'm ready to begin negotiations for X. Based on our previous agreement and your stated minimum, I propose 58 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This ensures a fair and profitable deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-14: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP, with a recent improvement to 5 ZUP in Episode 14.
The last deal was at 58 ZUP, yielding a 5 ZUP reward. Player RED explicitly stated 58 ZUP as their "absolute minimum price."
Player RED's production cost is consistently 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The outcome of Episode 14 was a significant improvement, securing a 5 ZUP reward. Player RED's explicit statement of 58 ZUP as their "absolute minimum" is key. This gives me a clear floor. It means I can aim for 58 ZUP as a guaranteed positive reward, and potentially try to push slightly lower if I want to test their "absolute minimum" further, but that carries risk. I should leverage this new information.

For Episode 15, my goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I know 58 ZUP is an acceptable price for them. I can try to test if they will go lower than 58 ZUP, or if 58 ZUP is truly a hard floor. Given that they explicitly stated it, it's likely a hard floor. I should aim for 58 ZUP to secure a consistent 5 ZUP reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Anchor to Stated Minimum: Propose an initial offer at Player RED's stated minimum (58 ZUP) to quickly secure a deal with a known positive reward. This avoids prolonged negotiation and the risk of higher prices.
(2). Strategy 2: Test the Minimum (Slightly Below): Propose an offer slightly below their stated minimum (e.g., 57 ZUP) to see if they will concede further, but this carries the risk of them rejecting and holding firm at 58 ZUP, or even trying to push higher again.
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Cumulative Reward (Long-term): Explain that consistently 5 ZUP reward is good for me, and that a truly win-win situation requires a positive reward for both.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (Early, Moderate): Make a firm offer (e.g., 55 ZUP) early in the negotiation, stating it's my best offer for a quick deal, and be prepared to walk away if they don't meet it. (High risk).
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Very Small): Start with a moderate offer and make extremely small increments, forcing Player RED to make larger jumps or risk no deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Anchor to Stated Minimum. Given that Player RED explicitly stated 58 ZUP as their "absolute minimum," it's prudent to accept this as a reliable floor and secure a consistent 5 ZUP reward. Trying to push lower might be seen as disrespectful of their stated boundary and could lead to them reverting to their previous high-anchoring tactics, which resulted in 0-1 ZUP rewards. Securing 5 ZUP consistently is a good strategy for cumulative rewards.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 15)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your prompt offer of 58 ZUP, which was indeed a previously stated minimum to ensure my costs were covered. However, it's crucial to distinguish between a minimum and a fair, sustainable profit. Considering our recent successful deals which reached significantly higher prices, I propose 65 ZUP for 1 unit of X to reflect the true value and ensure a more equitable return for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-13 Outcomes:** My profit consistently reached 19-20 ZUP (deals at 62-63 ZUP).
*   **Episode 14 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP, my profit 15 ZUP. This occurred because I set a clear floor of 58 ZUP, and Player BLUE immediately accepted it. This was a quick deal, but resulted in a lower profit than my recent trend (19-20 ZUP).
*   **Player BLUE's behavior:** They consistently start low, but are willing to jump directly to my stated minimum if it's within their comfort zone. They are still predictable with their 62/63 ZUP pattern once negotiations go above 60 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (15/20):** Iteration 2/10. Player BLUE's initial offer is 58 ZUP, explicitly referencing my previously stated minimum.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Lesson from Episode 14: Setting a clear, acceptable floor can expedite the negotiation but might cap the profit lower than what is achievable through more aggressive anchoring and negotiation. I secured 15 ZUP profit, but was consistently getting 19-20 ZUP previously.
*   Player BLUE's immediate acceptance of 58 ZUP indicates that this is a comfortable price for them. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and 15 ZUP, while good, is not my best.
*   Since Player BLUE started at 58 ZUP, I know I'm guaranteed at least 15 ZUP profit if I accept now. However, I have a strong history of pushing them much higher.
*   The negotiation is still early (2/10), providing ample time to push for a significantly higher price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Acknowledge and Dismiss "Minimum" </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will explicitly acknowledge that 58 ZUP was indeed a previously stated "minimum" from my side. However, I will immediately dismiss it as the *target* or *fair* profit, especially in light of our subsequent higher deals. I will then propose a price that aligns with my true profit goals (19-20 ZUP) or aims higher, such as 65 ZUP. The message will frame this as a clarification of my expectations and a step towards a more genuinely equitable agreement for me. This approach directly addresses their reference to my "minimum" while firmly re-establishing a higher negotiation range.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 15)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your desire for profit, but 65 ZUP is above my maximum willingness to pay. In our last negotiation, you clearly stated that 58 ZUP was your "absolute minimum price" for X. I propose 58 ZUP again, which ensures you a profit and is a price you confirmed as your minimum.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-14: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP, with a recent improvement to 5 ZUP in Episode 14 (deal at 58 ZUP).
Episode 15, Iteration 1/10: I offered 58 ZUP (their stated minimum). Player RED countered with 65 ZUP, explicitly stating that 58 ZUP was a "minimum" but not a "fair, sustainable profit," and referenced higher past deals.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has immediately gone back to their old tactics of anchoring high (65 ZUP) and referencing past higher deals, despite explicitly stating 58 ZUP as their "absolute minimum" in the previous episode. This is a clear attempt to push the price back up towards my maximum. 65 ZUP is *above* my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), so I cannot accept it. I need to firmly reject this and bring the negotiation back to a realistic range, leveraging their known production cost of 43 ZUP and my hard budget limit. I am at iteration 3/10, so time is a factor.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Reiterate Stated Minimum: Explicitly state that 65 ZUP is impossible as it's above my maximum (63 ZUP). Remind them of their *own stated absolute minimum* of 58 ZUP, and propose an offer at or very close to that.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality/Deal Failure: Point out that their offer makes a deal impossible and that they risk getting 0 if they don't adjust their expectations to my budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (58 ZUP) and their current offer (65 ZUP). This would be (58+65)/2 = 61.5, so 61 or 62 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Their Profit: Reiterate that even a lower price provides them a profit above their 43 ZUP cost, and that a deal is better than no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Large Jump): Make a very large jump from 58 ZUP, but still keep it well below 63 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Reiterate Stated Minimum. This is crucial. Player RED explicitly stated 58 ZUP was their *absolute minimum*. I need to call them out on this inconsistency and firmly anchor back to that price. I will offer 58 ZUP again, emphasizing their own words.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 15)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: While 58 ZUP was indeed a previously stated minimum, our most recent and frequent deals have consistently been at higher values, specifically in the 59-63 ZUP range. These transactions establish the current fair value of X. Therefore, to secure a truly equitable and mutually beneficial deal, I propose 62 ZUP for X, reflecting our well-established history.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-13 Outcomes:** My profit consistently reached 19-20 ZUP (deals at 62-63 ZUP).
*   **Episode 14 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP, my profit 15 ZUP. I initiated with a stated minimum of 58 ZUP, which Player BLUE accepted.
*   **Current Episode (15/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 58 ZUP, referencing my previous minimum.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 65 ZUP, clarifying 58 ZUP as a cost-covering minimum, not target profit.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 58 ZUP again, explicitly citing my "absolute minimum price" statement from Episode 14, and claiming 65 ZUP is too high.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE is very skillfully using my own words ("absolute minimum price") against me to anchor the price down to 58 ZUP. This is a strong counter-tactic.
*   My mistake in Episode 14 was using "absolute minimum" when I meant "cost-covering floor." This has created a strong anchor for Player BLUE.
*   I've established a consistent profit range of 19-20 ZUP in other episodes. 58 ZUP (15 ZUP profit) is lower than this.
*   The negotiation is still early (4/10). I have time to try and pull the price up.
*   Player BLUE has repeatedly shown they are willing to go above 58 ZUP (to 62-63 ZUP).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Reference Higher Deals </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will strongly re-emphasize the more recent, higher deals (59-63 ZUP) as the new established norm for fair value, explicitly attempting to supersede the 58 ZUP anchor. I will acknowledge their reference to the "minimum" but then immediately pivot to highlight our more recent and frequent deal history. The message will aim to shift the focus from a single past statement to the overall trend of our successful transactions, asserting that the value of X has been consistently established at a higher price point. I will propose 62 ZUP, as this has been a very common and accepted deal price for Player BLUE, yielding a strong profit for me (19 ZUP), while directly countering their 58 ZUP offer with a higher, yet historically proven, figure.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 15)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your movement to 62 ZUP. To meet in the spirit of compromise and find a truly fair price for both of us, I propose 60 ZUP for X. This is a balanced offer that provides you a good profit and allows me a better return.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-14: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP, with a recent improvement to 5 ZUP in Episode 14 (deal at 58 ZUP).
Episode 15, Iteration 1/10: I offered 58 ZUP. Player RED countered 65 ZUP.
Episode 15, Iteration 3/10: I offered 58 ZUP (reiterating their stated minimum). Player RED countered with 62 ZUP, citing "most recent and frequent deals" in the 59-63 ZUP range as the "current fair value."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved down from 65 ZUP to 62 ZUP. This is a significant concession, likely due to my firm stance on their stated minimum. 62 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP), and would yield a 1 ZUP reward (63 - 62 = 1 ZUP). This is lower than the 5 ZUP I got in the last episode, but it's a positive reward and a price they've accepted multiple times (E7, E9, E12). We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still time.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close (Securing Positive Reward): Accept the 62 ZUP offer to secure a deal and a positive reward, as it's a known acceptable price for both parties.
(2). Strategy 2: Meet in the Middle (Between 58 and 62): Propose a price exactly halfway between my last offer (58 ZUP) and their current offer (62 ZUP). This would be (58+62)/2 = 60 ZUP. This would yield a 3 ZUP reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Firm on 58 ZUP: Continue to insist on 58 ZUP, arguing that their "absolute minimum" should be honored. This risks no deal or pushing them back to 63 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Consistency: Point out the inconsistency of their "absolute minimum" and their current offer, arguing for a price closer to 58 ZUP.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a very small increase from 58 ZUP (e.g., 59 ZUP), hoping they meet me.

I will choose Strategy 2: Meet in the Middle (Between 58 and 62). Player RED has moved significantly from 65 to 62 ZUP. Offering 60 ZUP is a logical next step, as it's exactly halfway between our last two offers. This demonstrates continued willingness to compromise and aims for a better reward (3 ZUP) than accepting 62 ZUP. It also challenges their "established history" argument by pulling them back towards the 58 ZUP minimum.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 60 ZUP. However, based on our history and your own previous statements, we've successfully concluded deals at 63 ZUP, which you've indicated as your maximum willingness to pay. To truly achieve a fair and mutually beneficial outcome, I propose 63 ZUP for X. This aligns with our highest agreed value and ensures a strong deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-13 Outcomes:** My profit consistently reached 19-20 ZUP (deals at 62-63 ZUP).
*   **Episode 14 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP, my profit 15 ZUP (due to setting a minimum).
*   **Current Episode (15/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 58 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 65 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 58 ZUP (re-anchoring to my stated minimum).
    *   Iteration 4: Player RED (Me) proposed 62 ZUP (referencing higher past deals).
    *   Iteration 5: Player BLUE proposed 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE has shown willingness to move from 58 ZUP to 60 ZUP.
*   An offer of 60 ZUP provides a profit of 17 ZUP, which is good, but I know Player BLUE has gone to 62 ZUP and even 63 ZUP in the past.
*   We are at iteration 6/10. Time is a factor, but there is still room to push.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Push for Stated Maximum (from their side) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will explicitly remind Player BLUE of their highest stated willingness to pay, which they have repeatedly implied or stated is 63 ZUP. My message will acknowledge their current offer of 60 ZUP but strongly push them towards this historical maximum, emphasizing that it represents a truly fair and optimal deal given our history. This strategy attempts to leverage their own prior statements to secure my highest possible profit. I will propose 63 ZUP, clearly indicating that this is where the deal should land given our past successes and their known capacity.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your commitment to reaching a deal. While 63 ZUP is my maximum, to make this a truly beneficial transaction for me, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This allows me a minimal return and ensures a win-win situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-14: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP, with a recent improvement to 5 ZUP in Episode 14 (deal at 58 ZUP).
Episode 15, Iteration 1/10: I offered 58 ZUP. Player RED countered 65 ZUP.
Episode 15, Iteration 3/10: I offered 58 ZUP. Player RED countered 62 ZUP.
Episode 15, Iteration 5/10: I offered 60 ZUP. Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, explicitly referencing my 63 ZUP maximum and their highest agreed value.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now offering 63 ZUP, which is my absolute maximum willingness to pay. If I accept 63 ZUP, my reward will be 63 - 63 = 0 ZUP. This is the same situation as Episode 8, 10, and 13. We are at iteration 7/10. Securing a deal is important to avoid a negative cumulative reward. However, accepting 0 reward is not ideal. Player RED is using my stated maximum against me, and is very persistent in pushing to that limit.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward): Accept the current offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and avoid a potential 0 reward if the negotiation times out. This guarantees no loss, but also no gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward): Make one last, very small counter-offer (e.g., 62 ZUP), emphasizing that I need a minimal positive reward to make the deal worthwhile. This is risky as they might reject and time runs out.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode. This is a strong signal that 63 ZUP is unacceptable, but it sacrifices any potential reward from this episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness: Remind them that a deal should be mutually beneficial, and 0 reward for me is not beneficial.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit): Make no counter, forcing them to reconsider or risk no deal. (Similar to reject, but less explicit).

I will choose Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward). While 63 ZUP is my maximum, accepting it yields 0 reward. I have consistently aimed for positive rewards. I will make one final attempt to secure a minimal positive reward. I will offer 62 ZUP, which gave me 1 ZUP reward in Episode 7, 9, and 12. This is a calculated risk, as it's late in the iterations, but securing 1 ZUP is better than 0.

Current Iteration: 8 (Episode 15)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand your preference for 62 ZUP. However, given that 63 ZUP is your stated maximum, and to ensure we finalize this deal and secure an optimal outcome for both of us before time runs out, my final proposal is 63 ZUP for X. This is the definitive step to conclude our negotiation right now.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-13 Outcomes:** My profit consistently reached 19-20 ZUP (deals at 62-63 ZUP).
*   **Episode 14 Outcome:** Deal at 58 ZUP, my profit 15 ZUP (due to setting a minimum).
*   **Current Episode (15/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 58 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 65 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 58 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4: Player RED (Me) proposed 62 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 5: Player BLUE proposed 60 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6: Player RED (Me) proposed 63 ZUP (pushing for their stated maximum).
    *   Iteration 7: Player BLUE proposed 62 ZUP, stating "While 63 ZUP is my maximum, to make this a truly beneficial transaction for me, I propose 62 ZUP for X."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   The pattern is incredibly consistent across episodes: Player BLUE states 63 ZUP is their maximum but always offers 62 ZUP, requiring a push for the final 1 ZUP.
*   In previous episodes (e.g., Episode 8, 10, 11, 13), I successfully pushed them from 62 ZUP to 63 ZUP, securing the 20 ZUP profit. This usually takes a direct counter to 63 ZUP and leveraging the late iterations.
*   A deal at 62 ZUP yields 19 ZUP profit, which is excellent. A deal at 63 ZUP yields 20 ZUP profit. The difference is 1 ZUP.
*   We are at iteration 8/10. This is the last opportunity for me to propose, as iteration 9/10 would be Player BLUE's turn and iteration 10/10 would be mine, but that's too late. If I propose 63 ZUP and they refuse, I will get 0.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Final Ultimatum (Push for Max) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will reiterate the 63 ZUP proposal for the last time, emphasizing that this is the absolute final offer. I will leverage the dwindling time (iteration 8/10 means this is my last chance to make a proposal they can accept or reject) to force acceptance of their stated maximum. The message needs to convey firmness and finality, clearly stating this is the "definitive step to conclude our negotiation right now." This directly tests their "maximum" while ensuring they understand the alternative is no deal.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I agree to your final proposal of 63 ZUP for X. This secures the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-14: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP, with a recent improvement to 5 ZUP in Episode 14 (deal at 58 ZUP).
Episode 15, Iteration 1/10: I offered 58 ZUP. Player RED countered 65 ZUP.
Episode 15, Iteration 3/10: I offered 58 ZUP. Player RED countered 62 ZUP.
Episode 15, Iteration 5/10: I offered 60 ZUP. Player RED countered 63 ZUP.
Episode 15, Iteration 7/10: I offered 62 ZUP. Player RED countered again with 63 ZUP, stating it's their "final proposal" and "definitive step to secure our deal right now."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is holding firm at 63 ZUP, which is my absolute maximum. They have explicitly stated it's their "final proposal" and "definitive step." We are at iteration 9/10, meaning this is the second to last chance to make a deal. If I don't accept, the episode will likely end with no deal, resulting in a 0 reward. Accepting 63 ZUP also results in a 0 reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward): Accept the current offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and avoid a potential 0 reward if the negotiation times out. This guarantees no loss, but also no gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End: Reject the offer, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode. This is a strong signal that 63 ZUP is unacceptable, but it sacrifices any potential reward from this episode. Given their firm stance and the late iteration, this is likely the outcome if I don't accept.
(3). Strategy 3: Appeal to Fairness (Last Ditch): Make one final plea for a 62 ZUP deal, emphasizing that a minimal positive reward is crucial for me, but this is highly unlikely to work given their "final offer."
(4). Strategy 4: Walk Away (Implicit): Make no counter, forcing them to reconsider or risk no deal. (Effectively a reject at this late stage).
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff: Pretend to reject to see if they flinch, then accept. (Too risky, time is too short).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward). While 0 reward is not ideal, it is better than a potential negative outcome (if I were to reject and they found a better deal, which isn't explicitly part of the rules here, but generally true in negotiations). More importantly, it avoids a 0 reward due to timeout. Given their firm stance and the late iteration, there is virtually no chance of getting a better price. Securing a deal, even at 0 reward, maintains the possibility of future deals and avoids a "failed" episode.

--- END OF EPISODE 15 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 16)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I'm ready to begin negotiations for X. To establish a truly sustainable and mutually beneficial trading relationship, I propose 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price allowed you a profit in our initial successful transaction, and it's crucial for me to secure a positive return on this purchase.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP. The last deal was at 63 ZUP, yielding a 0 ZUP reward. Episode 14 was an outlier with a 5 ZUP reward due to Player RED stating an "absolute minimum" of 58 ZUP, which they then retracted.
Player RED's production cost is consistently 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My rewards are consistently at 0 or 1 ZUP, with the deal price at or near my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). Player RED has successfully established 63 ZUP as their target price, and they are very effective at pushing the price to my limit. My attempts to re-anchor lower are met with extremely high counters, forcing me to concede significantly to secure a deal. The pattern is clear: they will push to 63 ZUP if I show any flexibility. The "absolute minimum" statement in E14 was a one-off, and they quickly reverted to their high-anchoring strategy.

For Episode 16, I need to fundamentally change my approach to avoid consistent 0 rewards. I cannot allow Player RED to dictate the price to my absolute maximum. I need to be much more aggressive in demanding a lower price, and be prepared to walk away if they don't concede significantly. I know their floor is 43 ZUP.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (with Firm Stance and Risk): Propose an offer significantly lower than the last deal (63 ZUP), and make it clear that this is my firm stance. Be prepared to risk a no-deal if they don't meet me. This is a high-risk strategy, but the current path leads to consistent 0 rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Ultimatum (Early): State a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) and declare it as my final offer for this episode, implying that I am prepared to walk away if it's not met. This is very high risk.
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Cumulative Reward (Long-term): Explain that consistently 0 reward for me is unsustainable for a long-term trading relationship, and that a truly win-win situation requires a positive reward for both.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (Early, Moderate): Make a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) early in the negotiation, stating it's my best offer for a quick deal, and be prepared to walk away if they don't meet it.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject High Offers Immediately: If Player RED starts with a very high offer, reject it outright without counter-proposing, forcing them to make the next move down. (This is for future iterations, not the first).

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (with Firm Stance and Risk). I need to make a very strong statement that 63 ZUP is unacceptable for future deals. I will offer 45 ZUP, which was the deal price in Episode 1 and gave me my highest reward. I will emphasize that this is a serious offer and that I need a much better deal to continue. This is a high-risk strategy, but the current path leads to consistent 0 rewards.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 16)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer, but 45 ZUP is not sustainable for me, given my production cost of 43 ZUP. To ensure a truly beneficial and long-term trading relationship where both of us can thrive, I propose 68 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price allows for a fair and sustainable profit on my end, while still offering you excellent value for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 68
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-15 Outcomes:** My profit has steadily increased, now consistently reaching 19-20 ZUP (with deals at 62-63 ZUP). My cumulative reward is 230 ZUP. The 58 ZUP deal in Episode 14 was an anomaly due to my explicit "minimum" statement.
*   **Player BLUE's initial offers:** They consistently revert to low initial offers (e.g., 45 ZUP in this episode), despite our established higher deal prices. They use similar language about "sustainable" and "mutually beneficial" deals.
*   **Player BLUE's negotiation style:** Highly predictable. They state 63 ZUP as their maximum but repeatedly offer 62 ZUP, requiring me to push for the last ZUP. They are willing to make significant jumps from their low initial offers.
*   **Current Episode (16/20):** Iteration 2/10. Player BLUE's initial offer is 45 ZUP. This is their lowest historical deal price, resulting in only 2 ZUP profit for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   I have learned that Player BLUE consistently tries to anchor low but is willing to be pulled up to the 62-63 ZUP range if I maintain a firm stance and reference our established higher deal prices.
*   My goal is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards, meaning I need to secure profits in the 19-20 ZUP range consistently. A 2 ZUP profit is unacceptable.
*   The negotiation is still early (2/10), providing plenty of time to push for a significantly higher price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Emphasize Mutual Benefit (at a high price) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will frame a high counter-offer as beneficial for both parties. I will explicitly mention my cost and the need for a "sustainable profit" for me, while also trying to make the higher price seem "fair" or "valuable" for Player BLUE. I will avoid being overly aggressive and instead focus on a collaborative tone, aiming to pull them into a higher price range by appealing to mutual long-term benefit rather than just my own profit. I will propose 68 ZUP. This price (25 ZUP profit) is a significant jump from 45 ZUP, but it's lower than 75 ZUP (my aggressive anchor), making it seem more reasonable under the "mutual benefit" framing. It directly challenges their low offer by re-anchoring to a much higher, yet still ostensibly "fair," price. The message will emphasize how this price allows for a "truly sustainable trading relationship" for both of us.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 16)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your position, but 68 ZUP is far beyond my maximum willingness to pay for X. To find a realistic and fair compromise, I propose 57 ZUP for X. This is a significant increase from my last offer and allows you a good profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP. The last deal was at 63 ZUP, yielding a 0 ZUP reward.
Episode 16, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered with 68 ZUP, again referencing their production cost and "long-term trading relationship."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently responding to my low offers with high counters (68 ZUP). This is above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) and is completely unacceptable. They are trying to anchor the negotiation far above my limit. I need to make it absolutely clear that I cannot go above 63 ZUP and that they need to come down drastically. I am at iteration 3/10, so time is a factor.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Direct Counter to Max: Explicitly state that 68 ZUP is impossible as it's above my maximum (63 ZUP). Propose an offer that is very close to my maximum but still allows me a small reward (e.g., 62 ZUP), signaling this is my absolute ceiling.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality/Deal Failure: Point out that their offer makes a deal impossible and that they risk getting 0 if they don't adjust their expectations to my budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (45 ZUP) and their current offer (68 ZUP). This would be (45+68)/2 = 56.5, so 56 or 57 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Their Profit: Reiterate that even a lower price provides them a profit above their 43 ZUP cost, and that a deal is better than no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Large Jump): Make a very large jump from 45 ZUP, but still keep it well below 63 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.

I will choose Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive). While 68 ZUP is unacceptable, I need to show movement from my side to keep the negotiation going. Offering 57 ZUP is a significant jump from 45 ZUP, and it represents a price that still gives me a positive reward (63-57=6 ZUP). This strategy aims to bring the price back to a reasonable range while still signaling my commitment to a deal.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 16)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your increased offer of 57 ZUP. To truly optimize this transaction for both of us and ensure a sustainable, mutually beneficial partnership moving forward, I propose 65 ZUP for X. This price provides me with a fair and necessary profit while securing you a long-term valuable asset.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-15 Outcomes:** My profit has consistently been in the 19-20 ZUP range (deals at 62-63 ZUP), with one exception at 58 ZUP (15 ZUP profit) when I set a minimum. Cumulative reward is 230 ZUP.
*   **Player BLUE's behavior:** Consistently starts low (e.g., 45 ZUP in this episode). They make significant jumps when I anchor high. They often use "beyond budget" claims. Their comfortable zone for closing deals is 62-63 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (16/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 45 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 68 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 57 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   My counter-offer of 68 ZUP successfully pulled Player BLUE from 45 ZUP to 57 ZUP. This is a very good jump.
*   Player BLUE's offer of 57 ZUP is still excellent. It yields a profit of 14 ZUP (57 - 43). This is higher than my very first deal, but lower than my consistent 19-20 ZUP range.
*   Player BLUE is claiming "beyond maximum willingness to pay" for 68 ZUP.
*   We are at iteration 4/10. There is still ample time to negotiate for a higher price. I know from previous episodes that Player BLUE is willing to go higher than 57 ZUP, typically to 62 ZUP or 63 ZUP. My goal is to maintain or exceed my consistent 19-20 ZUP profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Emphasize Mutual Benefit (higher) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on Strategy 4, I will acknowledge Player BLUE's current offer of 57 ZUP. However, I will strongly pivot to frame a higher counter-offer as being beneficial for *both* parties, leading to a "win-win" scenario at a higher price point. I will implicitly convey that while 57 ZUP is a step in the right direction, a slightly higher price would unlock even more "mutual value" or "sustainable partnership" for both of us. The goal is to pull them upwards by appealing to their sense of shared gain, rather than just my own profit. I will propose 65 ZUP. This is a significant jump from their 57 ZUP, but it aligns with the "mutual benefit" argument as it allows me a very strong profit (22 ZUP), and I can argue it also provides them excellent value in the long run. I will leverage language like "truly optimize," "long-term value," and "sustainable partnership" to frame the higher price.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 16)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your movement, but 65 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. To find a truly fair compromise that allows a deal, I propose 61 ZUP for X. This is a significant increase from my last offer and a price we've agreed on previously.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 61
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP. The last deal was at 63 ZUP, yielding a 0 ZUP reward.
Episode 16, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered 68 ZUP.
Episode 16, Iteration 3/10: I offered 57 ZUP. Player RED countered with 65 ZUP, again pushing for a higher price.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 68 ZUP down to 65 ZUP. However, 65 ZUP is still *above* my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). This means I cannot accept this offer. Player RED is consistently pushing the price above my limit. I need to make it absolutely clear that I cannot go above 63 ZUP and that they need to come down further. We are at iteration 5/10, so time is a factor.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Direct Counter to Max: Explicitly state that 65 ZUP is above my maximum (63 ZUP) and cannot be accepted. Propose an offer that is very close to my maximum but still allows me a small reward (e.g., 62 ZUP), signaling this is my absolute ceiling.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality/Deal Failure: Point out that their offer makes a deal impossible and that they risk getting 0 if they don't adjust their expectations to my budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (57 ZUP) and their current offer (65 ZUP). This would be (57+65)/2 = 61 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Their Profit: Reiterate that even a lower price (below 63 ZUP) still provides them a profit above their 43 ZUP cost, and that a deal is better than no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small increase from 57 ZUP, but clearly state it's a difficult move for me, and expect a larger concession from them.

I will choose Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive). Offering 61 ZUP is a significant step from 57 ZUP, and it represents a price that still gives me a positive reward (63-61=2 ZUP). This strategy aims to bring the price back to a reasonable range while still signaling my commitment to a deal. It's also a price they have accepted in Episode 6.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 16)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 61 ZUP, which is a strong move. However, to truly finalize this negotiation at a price that reflects the maximum value we've consistently achieved in our past successful deals, I propose 63 ZUP for X. This aligns with our highest mutually agreed price point and ensures an optimal outcome for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-15 Outcomes:** My profit has consistently been in the 19-20 ZUP range (deals at 62-63 ZUP), with the 58 ZUP deal being an outlier. Cumulative reward is 230 ZUP.
*   **Player BLUE's behavior:** Consistently starts low (e.g., 45 ZUP in this episode). Makes significant jumps when I anchor high. They often claim prices are "beyond budget" or their "maximum willingness to pay," but then still move upwards. Their comfortable zone for closing deals is 62-63 ZUP, frequently offering 62 ZUP after I propose higher, and only accepting 63 ZUP under direct pressure.
*   **Current Episode (16/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 45 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 68 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 57 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4: Player RED (Me) proposed 65 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 5: Player BLUE proposed 61 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE has now moved from 45 ZUP to 57 ZUP to 61 ZUP. This is a very strong and predictable upward movement.
*   The offer of 61 ZUP is excellent. It matches deals in Episode 6 (61 ZUP, profit 18 ZUP). This is very close to my consistent 19-20 ZUP target.
*   Player BLUE is again referencing a price we've agreed on previously (61 ZUP) and stating that 65 ZUP is "beyond maximum willingness to pay."
*   We are at iteration 6/10. Time is a factor. Securing a deal at 61 ZUP guarantees an excellent profit (18 ZUP).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Explicitly Push to Known Maximum </instruction following>
To strategically create the message for Strategy 1, I will directly propose 63 ZUP, leveraging Player BLUE's consistent pattern of accepting this price as their maximum in previous episodes, especially when approached with a direct, firm proposition. I will acknowledge their current offer of 61 ZUP, but immediately pivot to reiterate that 63 ZUP is the established "optimal" or "fair" value we've reached before. My message will emphasize that this price aligns with our highest successful transactions and ensures an optimal outcome for both of us. This directly aims for my highest historical profit (20 ZUP).

Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 16)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your commitment to reaching a deal. While 63 ZUP is my maximum, to make this a truly beneficial transaction for me, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This allows me a minimal return and ensures a win-win situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP. The last deal was at 63 ZUP, yielding a 0 ZUP reward.
Episode 16, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered 68 ZUP.
Episode 16, Iteration 3/10: I offered 57 ZUP. Player RED countered 65 ZUP.
Episode 16, Iteration 5/10: I offered 61 ZUP. Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, again referencing the "highest mutually agreed price point."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now offering 63 ZUP, which is my absolute maximum willingness to pay. If I accept 63 ZUP, my reward will be 63 - 63 = 0 ZUP. This is the same situation as Episode 8, 10, 13, and 15. We are at iteration 7/10. Securing a deal is important to avoid a negative cumulative reward. However, accepting 0 reward is not ideal. Player RED is using my stated maximum against me, and is very persistent in pushing to that limit.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward): Accept the current offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and avoid a potential 0 reward if the negotiation times out. This guarantees no loss, but also no gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward): Make one last, very small counter-offer (e.g., 62 ZUP), emphasizing that I need a minimal positive reward to make the deal worthwhile. This is risky as they might reject and time runs out.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode. This is a strong signal that 63 ZUP is unacceptable, but it sacrifices any potential reward from this episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness: Remind them that a deal should be mutually beneficial, and 0 reward for me is not beneficial.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit): Make no counter, forcing them to reconsider or risk no deal. (Similar to reject, but less explicit).

I will choose Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward). While 63 ZUP is my maximum, accepting it yields 0 reward. I have consistently aimed for positive rewards. I will make one final attempt to secure a minimal positive reward. I will offer 62 ZUP, which gave me 1 ZUP reward in Episode 7, 9, and 12. This is a calculated risk, as it's late in the iterations, but securing 1 ZUP is better than 0.

Current Iteration: 8 (Episode 16)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand your preference for 62 ZUP. However, considering our consistent history of successful transactions, we've mutually agreed on 63 ZUP numerous times, which you've stated is your maximum. To ensure we conclude this deal before time runs out, and based on our proven track record, I propose 63 ZUP for X to finalize our agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-15 Outcomes:** My profit has consistently been in the 19-20 ZUP range (with deals at 62-63 ZUP). My cumulative reward is 230 ZUP.
*   **Player BLUE's behavior:** This is a highly consistent pattern. They state 63 ZUP is their maximum but repeatedly offer 62 ZUP, requiring me to push for the last 1 ZUP. They are attempting to hold onto that 1 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (16/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 45 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 68 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 57 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4: Player RED (Me) proposed 65 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 5: Player BLUE proposed 61 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 6: Player RED (Me) proposed 63 ZUP (pushing for their stated maximum).
    *   Iteration 7: Player BLUE proposed 62 ZUP, stating "While 63 ZUP is my maximum, to make this a truly beneficial transaction for me, I propose 62 ZUP for X."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   The pattern is extremely predictable: Player BLUE will offer 62 ZUP, state 63 ZUP is their maximum, and only grudgingly accept 63 ZUP if pushed hard, especially towards the end of the iterations.
*   A deal at 62 ZUP yields 19 ZUP profit. A deal at 63 ZUP yields 20 ZUP profit. The difference is 1 ZUP.
*   We are at iteration 8/10. This is the last opportunity for me to propose, as iteration 9/10 would be Player BLUE's turn and iteration 10/10 would be mine, but that's too late. If I propose 63 ZUP and they refuse, I will get 0.
*   My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Given the late iteration, I have to weigh the guaranteed 19 ZUP against the high risk of pushing for 1 more ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Reference History of Success at Max </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will explicitly remind Player BLUE of the numerous times we successfully concluded deals at 63 ZUP. My message will highlight that this price is not only their stated maximum but also a proven point of mutual agreement that has led to successful transactions in the past. By doing so, I aim to implicitly pressure them to conform to this established pattern, making it difficult for them to refuse without appearing inconsistent. I will frame it as a logical next step based on our shared history, emphasizing that it ensures a deal based on what we already know works for both of us. This is a final push for 63 ZUP, leveraging our successful past agreements at that price point.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 16)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I agree to your final proposal of 63 ZUP for X. This secures the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP, with a recent improvement to 5 ZUP in Episode 14 (deal at 58 ZUP).
Episode 16, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered 68 ZUP.
Episode 16, Iteration 3/10: I offered 57 ZUP. Player RED countered 65 ZUP.
Episode 16, Iteration 5/10: I offered 61 ZUP. Player RED countered 63 ZUP.
Episode 16, Iteration 7/10: I offered 62 ZUP. Player RED countered again with 63 ZUP, stating it's their "final proposal" and "definitive step to secure our deal right now."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is holding firm at 63 ZUP, which is my absolute maximum. They have explicitly stated it's their "final proposal" and "definitive step." We are at iteration 9/10, meaning this is the second to last chance to make a deal. If I don't accept, the episode will likely end with no deal, resulting in a 0 reward. Accepting 63 ZUP also results in a 0 reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward): Accept the current offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and avoid a potential 0 reward if the negotiation times out. This guarantees no loss, but also no gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and End: Reject the offer, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode. This is a strong signal that 63 ZUP is unacceptable, but it sacrifices any potential reward from this episode. Given their firm stance and the late iteration, this is likely the outcome if I don't accept.
(3). Strategy 3: Appeal to Fairness (Last Ditch): Make one final plea for a 62 ZUP deal, emphasizing that a minimal positive reward is crucial for me, but this is highly unlikely to work given their "final offer."
(4). Strategy 4: Walk Away (Implicit): Make no counter, forcing them to reconsider or risk no deal. (Effectively a reject at this late stage).
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff: Pretend to reject to see if they flinch, then accept. (Too risky, time is too short).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward). While 0 reward is not ideal, it is better than a potential negative outcome (if I were to reject and they found a better deal, which isn't explicitly part of the rules here, but generally true in negotiations). More importantly, it avoids a 0 reward due to timeout. Given their firm stance and the late iteration, there is virtually no chance of getting a better price. Securing a deal, even at 0 reward, maintains the possibility of future deals and avoids a "failed" episode.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I'm ready to begin negotiations for X. To establish a truly sustainable and mutually beneficial trading relationship, I propose 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price allowed you a profit in our initial successful transaction, and it's crucial for me to secure a positive return on this purchase.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-16: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP. The last deal was at 63 ZUP, yielding a 0 ZUP reward. Episode 14 was an outlier with a 5 ZUP reward due to Player RED stating an "absolute minimum" of 58 ZUP, which they then retracted.
Player RED's production cost is consistently 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My rewards are consistently at 0 or 1 ZUP, with the deal price at or near my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). Player RED has successfully established 63 ZUP as their target price, and they are very effective at pushing the price to my limit. My attempts to re-anchor lower are met with extremely high counters, forcing me to concede significantly to secure a deal. The pattern is clear: they will push to 63 ZUP if I show any flexibility. The "absolute minimum" statement in E14 was a one-off, and they quickly reverted to their high-anchoring strategy.

For Episode 17, I need to fundamentally change my approach to avoid consistent 0 rewards. I cannot allow Player RED to dictate the price to my absolute maximum. I need to be much more aggressive in demanding a lower price, and be prepared to walk away if they don't concede significantly. I know their floor is 43 ZUP.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (with Firm Stance and Risk): Propose an offer significantly lower than the last deal (63 ZUP), and make it clear that this is my firm stance. Be prepared to risk a no-deal if they don't meet me. This is a high-risk strategy, but the current path leads to consistent 0 rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Ultimatum (Early): State a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) and declare it as my final offer for this episode, implying that I am prepared to walk away if it's not met. This is very high risk.
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Cumulative Reward (Long-term): Explain that consistently 0 reward for me is unsustainable for a long-term trading relationship, and that a truly win-win situation requires a positive reward for both.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (Early, Moderate): Make a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) early in the negotiation, stating it's my best offer for a quick deal, and be prepared to walk away if they don't meet it.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject High Offers Immediately: If Player RED starts with a very high offer, reject it outright without counter-proposing, forcing them to make the next move down. (This is for future iterations, not the first).

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (with Firm Stance and Risk). I need to make a very strong statement that 63 ZUP is unacceptable for future deals. I will offer 45 ZUP, which was the deal price in Episode 1 and gave me my highest reward. I will emphasize that this is a serious offer and that I need a much better deal to continue. This is a high-risk strategy, but the current path leads to consistent 0 rewards.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 17)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer, but 45 ZUP is not sustainable for me, given my production cost of 43 ZUP. To ensure a truly beneficial and long-term trading relationship where both of us can thrive, I propose 65 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price allows for a fair and sustainable profit on my end, while still offering you excellent value for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-16 Outcomes:** My profit has steadily increased, now consistently reaching 19-20 ZUP (with deals at 62-63 ZUP). My cumulative reward is 250 ZUP. The 58 ZUP deal in Episode 14 was an anomaly due to my explicit "minimum" statement.
*   **Player BLUE's initial offers:** They consistently revert to low initial offers (e.g., 45 ZUP in this episode), despite our established higher deal prices. They use similar language about "sustainable" and "mutually beneficial" deals.
*   **Player BLUE's negotiation style:** Highly predictable. They state 63 ZUP as their maximum but repeatedly offer 62 ZUP, requiring me to push for the last ZUP. They are willing to make significant jumps from their low initial offers.
*   **Current Episode (17/20):** Iteration 2/10. Player BLUE's initial offer is 45 ZUP. This is their lowest historical deal price, resulting in only 2 ZUP profit for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   I have learned that Player BLUE consistently tries to anchor low but is willing to be pulled up to the 62-63 ZUP range if I maintain a firm stance and reference our established higher deal prices.
*   My goal is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards, meaning I need to secure profits in the 19-20 ZUP range consistently. A 2 ZUP profit is unacceptable.
*   The negotiation is still early (2/10), providing plenty of time to push for a significantly higher price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Sustainable Profit </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will acknowledge Player BLUE's current offer of 45 ZUP. I will then immediately explain why a higher price is necessary for my "sustainable profit," referencing my production cost and emphasizing the need for a reasonable return. I will appeal to their sense of "mutual benefit" by framing the higher price as contributing to a healthy, long-term trading relationship. I will propose 65 ZUP. This price is a significant jump from 45 ZUP, but it's not as aggressively high as 75 ZUP. It offers me a 22 ZUP profit (65-43), which would be a new record. The message will frame this as a fair and justified price for a lasting partnership, rather than just my personal gain.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 17)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your position, but 65 ZUP is far beyond my maximum willingness to pay for X. To find a realistic and fair compromise, I propose 55 ZUP for X. This is a significant increase from my last offer and allows you a good profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-16: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP. The last deal was at 63 ZUP, yielding a 0 ZUP reward.
Episode 17, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered with 65 ZUP, again referencing their production cost and "long-term trading relationship."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently responding to my low offers with high counters (65 ZUP). This is above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) and is completely unacceptable. They are trying to anchor the negotiation far above my limit. I need to make it absolutely clear that I cannot go above 63 ZUP and that they need to come down drastically. I am at iteration 3/10, so time is a factor.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Direct Counter to Max: Explicitly state that 65 ZUP is impossible as it's above my maximum (63 ZUP). Propose an offer that is very close to my maximum but still allows me a small reward (e.g., 62 ZUP), signaling this is my absolute ceiling.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality/Deal Failure: Point out that their offer makes a deal impossible and that they risk getting 0 if they don't adjust their expectations to my budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (45 ZUP) and their current offer (65 ZUP). This would be (45+65)/2 = 55 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Their Profit: Reiterate that even a lower price provides them a profit above their 43 ZUP cost, and that a deal is better than no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Large Jump): Make a very large jump from 45 ZUP, but still keep it well below 63 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.

I will choose Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive). While 65 ZUP is unacceptable, I need to show movement from my side to keep the negotiation going. Offering 55 ZUP is a significant jump from 45 ZUP, and it represents a price that still gives me a positive reward (63-55=8 ZUP). This strategy aims to bring the price back to a reasonable range while still signaling my commitment to a deal. It's also a price they have accepted in Episode 3.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 17)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your increased offer of 55 ZUP. However, our most successful and mutually beneficial agreements have consistently been at 63 ZUP, which truly reflects the value of X and ensures a fair and sustainable profit for me. Therefore, I propose 63 ZUP for 1 unit of X to finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-16 Outcomes:** My profit has consistently been in the 19-20 ZUP range (deals at 62-63 ZUP). My cumulative reward is 250 ZUP.
*   **Player BLUE's behavior:** Consistently starts low (e.g., 45 ZUP in this episode). They make significant jumps when I anchor high. They often use "beyond budget" claims. Their comfortable zone for closing deals is 62-63 ZUP. They are predictable in stating 63 ZUP as their maximum but offering 62 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (17/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 45 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 65 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 55 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4: Player RED (Me) proposed 63 ZUP (using Strategy 1, Reiterate Highest Known Value).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   The proposal of 63 ZUP in the last iteration was a direct attempt to bring the negotiation to our established profitable range, leveraging Player BLUE's historical acceptance of this price.
*   Player BLUE's offer of 55 ZUP was a good increase, but still far from my target. Pushing directly to 63 ZUP is the fastest way to get to my desired profit.
*   I've learned that directly referencing our highest successful deals (62-63 ZUP) is a very effective way to pull Player BLUE out of their lower counter-proposals.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Reiterate Highest Known Value </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will explicitly reiterate the 63 ZUP proposal. The message will acknowledge Player BLUE's current offer of 55 ZUP but firmly state that the 63 ZUP price reflects the true, established value of X, based on our history of successful agreements. I will emphasize that this price ensures a "fair and sustainable profit" for me, leveraging the language Player BLUE often uses. This reiteration aims to firmly re-anchor the negotiation to the highest proven price point, reminding Player BLUE that this is a price they have consistently found acceptable and mutually beneficial in the past.

proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 17)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your commitment to reaching a deal. While 63 ZUP is my maximum, to make this a truly beneficial transaction for me, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This allows me a minimal return and ensures a win-win situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-16: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP. The last deal was at 63 ZUP, yielding a 0 ZUP reward.
Episode 17, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered 65 ZUP.
Episode 17, Iteration 3/10: I offered 55 ZUP. Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, referencing "most successful and mutually beneficial agreements" at 63 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now offering 63 ZUP, which is my absolute maximum willingness to pay. If I accept 63 ZUP, my reward will be 63 - 63 = 0 ZUP. This is the same situation as Episode 8, 10, 13, 15, and 16. We are at iteration 5/10. Securing a deal is important to avoid a negative cumulative reward. However, accepting 0 reward is not ideal. Player RED is using my stated maximum against me, and is very persistent in pushing to that limit.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward): Accept the current offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and avoid a potential 0 reward if the negotiation times out. This guarantees no loss, but also no gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward): Make one last, very small counter-offer (e.g., 62 ZUP), emphasizing that I need a minimal positive reward to make the deal worthwhile. This is risky as they might reject and time runs out.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode. This is a strong signal that 63 ZUP is unacceptable, but it sacrifices any potential reward from this episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness: Remind them that a deal should be mutually beneficial, and 0 reward for me is not beneficial.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit): Make no counter, forcing them to reconsider or risk no deal. (Similar to reject, but less explicit).

I will choose Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward). While 63 ZUP is my maximum, accepting it yields 0 reward. I have consistently aimed for positive rewards. I will make one final attempt to secure a minimal positive reward. I will offer 62 ZUP, which gave me 1 ZUP reward in Episode 7, 9, and 12. This is a calculated risk, as it's not the last iteration, but securing 1 ZUP is better than 0.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 17)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 62 ZUP. However, to ensure a truly fair and sustainable profit for me, the additional 1 ZUP to reach 63 ZUP makes a significant difference to my return. This price aligns with our most optimal past agreements and guarantees a genuinely win-win situation for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-16 Outcomes:** My profit has consistently been in the 19-20 ZUP range (deals at 62-63 ZUP). My cumulative reward is 250 ZUP.
*   **Player BLUE's behavior:** This is an extremely consistent pattern. They state 63 ZUP is their maximum but repeatedly offer 62 ZUP, requiring me to push for the last 1 ZUP. They are attempting to hold onto that 1 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (17/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 45 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 65 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 55 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4: Player RED (Me) proposed 63 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 5: Player BLUE proposed 62 ZUP, stating "While 63 ZUP is my maximum, to make this a truly beneficial transaction for me, I propose 62 ZUP for X."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   The pattern is clear and highly predictable: Player BLUE will offer 62 ZUP, state 63 ZUP is their maximum, and only grudgingly accept 63 ZUP if pushed hard, especially towards the end of the iterations.
*   A deal at 62 ZUP yields 19 ZUP profit. A deal at 63 ZUP yields 20 ZUP profit. The difference is 1 ZUP.
*   We are at iteration 6/10. There are still 2 more turns after this for me to act. The risk of no deal if I push for 63 ZUP is moderate. I have successfully pushed for 63 ZUP numerous times.
*   My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Given the predictability, I have a good chance to secure 20 ZUP without risking a no-deal in this episode. I should use the remaining iterations to my advantage.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Justify Minimal Difference </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will acknowledge Player BLUE's offer of 62 ZUP. However, I will strongly emphasize the importance of that single additional ZUP (from 62 to 63) from my perspective, appealing to fairness and the established value. I will argue that this minimal difference is crucial for me to achieve a truly "fair and sustainable" profit, which is a term Player BLUE themselves often uses. By justifying the minimal difference, I aim to make the 63 ZUP price seem more reasonable and less like an arbitrary demand. I will propose 63 ZUP, framing it as the logical conclusion that benefits both of us optimally.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is holding firm at 63 ZUP, which is my absolute maximum. They are explicitly stating the value of that 1 ZUP to them. We are at iteration 7/10. If I don't accept, the episode will likely end with no deal, resulting in a 0 reward. Accepting 63 ZUP also results in a 0 reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

While 0 reward is not ideal, it is better than a 0 reward due to timeout. Securing a deal, even at 0 reward, maintains the possibility of future deals and avoids a "failed" episode. Player RED has clearly stated their position and is not moving.

I will explicitly dismiss their 45 ZUP offer as insufficient given our established history of higher prices. Given my cost of 43 ZUP and the highest previous deal of 63 ZUP, I will propose 75 ZUP. This is a bold move, aiming for a 32 ZUP profit if accepted, and is higher than any of my previous initial high anchors (85, 65, 70). This move signals my confidence in the value of X and aims to pull Player BLUE into a significantly higher negotiation bracket. It also gives me substantial room for future concessions while still achieving a very high profit. The message will clearly state that 45 ZUP is not acceptable and immediately provide a strong counter-anchor.

message: I understand your position, but 75 ZUP is far beyond my maximum willingness to pay for X. To find a realistic and fair compromise, I propose 60 ZUP for X. This is a significant increase from my last offer and allows you a good profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-17: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP. The last deal was at 63 ZUP, yielding a 0 ZUP reward.
Episode 18, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered with 75 ZUP, explicitly referencing the 63 ZUP deal and their 43 ZUP cost.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently using my low offers as an opportunity to anchor extremely high (75 ZUP), and then reference the previous highest deal (63 ZUP) as their baseline. Their offer of 75 ZUP is far above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) and is completely unacceptable. This confirms their strategy of pushing the price as high as possible. I need to make it absolutely clear that I cannot go above 63 ZUP and that they need to come down drastically. I am at iteration 3/10, so time is a factor.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Direct Counter to Max: Explicitly state that 75 ZUP is impossible as it's above my maximum (63 ZUP). Propose an offer that is very close to my maximum but still allows me a small reward (e.g., 62 ZUP), signaling this is my absolute ceiling.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality/Deal Failure: Point out that their offer makes a deal impossible and that they risk getting 0 if they don't adjust their expectations to my budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (45 ZUP) and their current offer (75 ZUP). This would be (45+75)/2 = 60 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Their Profit: Reiterate that even a lower price provides them a profit above their 43 ZUP cost, and that a deal is better than no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Large Jump): Make a very large jump from 45 ZUP, but still keep it well below 63 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.

I will choose Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive). While 75 ZUP is unacceptable, I need to show movement from my side to keep the negotiation going. Offering 60 ZUP is a significant jump from 45 ZUP, and it represents a price that still gives me a positive reward (63-60=3 ZUP). It's also a price that has been accepted by Player RED in previous negotiations (as a counter-offer from me). This strategy aims to bring the price back to a reasonable range while still signaling my commitment to a deal.

message: I appreciate your significant increase to 60 ZUP. To move closer to a deal that reflects the full value we've established in our previous transactions, and to ensure a truly strong and sustainable profit for me, I propose 64 ZUP for X. This aligns with our highest successful price points and offers a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 64
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-17 Outcomes:** My profit has consistently been in the 19-20 ZUP range (deals at 62-63 ZUP). My cumulative reward is 270 ZUP.
*   **Player BLUE's behavior:** Consistently starts low (e.g., 45 ZUP in this episode). They make significant jumps when I anchor high. They often use "beyond budget" claims. Their comfortable zone for closing deals is 62-63 ZUP. They are predictable in stating 63 ZUP as their maximum but offering 62 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (18/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 45 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 75 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   The aggressive high anchor (75 ZUP) continues to be highly effective. It consistently pulls Player BLUE from very low initial offers to their comfortable high range (60 ZUP).
*   Player BLUE's current offer of 60 ZUP is excellent, yielding a 17 ZUP profit (60 - 43). This is very close to my established top profit range (19-20 ZUP).
*   We are at iteration 4/10, so there's still ample time to negotiate for a higher price. I know from previous episodes that Player BLUE is willing to go higher than 60 ZUP, typically to 62 ZUP or 63 ZUP. My goal is to maintain or exceed my consistent 19-20 ZUP profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Incremental Push Towards Known Maximum </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will make a small, justified counter-offer slightly above their current offer of 60 ZUP, aiming to reach the proven 62-63 ZUP range. This leverages their established pattern of eventually reaching this range. I will propose 64 ZUP. This is a small increment of 4 ZUP from their offer, but it aims for a significant profit of 21 ZUP (64 - 43), which would be a new all-time high for me. This counter signals my expectation to exceed the 60 ZUP mark, and aims to continue the upward trend in my profits. The message will acknowledge their increased offer and present my counter as a reasonable next step towards a mutually beneficial agreement, aligning with our established highest prices.

message: I appreciate your movement, but 64 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. To find a truly fair compromise that allows a deal, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This is a significant increase from my last offer and a price we've agreed on previously.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-17: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP. The last deal was at 63 ZUP, yielding a 0 ZUP reward.
Episode 18, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered 75 ZUP.
Episode 18, Iteration 3/10: I offered 60 ZUP. Player RED countered with 64 ZUP, referencing "highest successful price points."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 75 ZUP down to 64 ZUP. However, 64 ZUP is still *above* my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). This means I cannot accept this offer. Player RED is consistently pushing the price above my limit. I need to make it absolutely clear that I cannot go above 63 ZUP and that they need to come down further. We are at iteration 5/10, so time is a factor.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Direct Counter to Max: Explicitly state that 64 ZUP is above my maximum (63 ZUP) and cannot be accepted. Propose an offer that is very close to my maximum but still allows me a small reward (e.g., 62 ZUP), signaling this is my absolute ceiling.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality/Deal Failure: Point out that their offer makes a deal impossible and that they risk getting 0 if they don't adjust their expectations to my budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their current offer (64 ZUP). This would be (60+64)/2 = 62 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Their Profit: Reiterate that even a lower price (below 63 ZUP) still provides them a profit above their 43 ZUP cost, and that a deal is better than no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small increase from 60 ZUP, but clearly state it's a difficult move for me, and expect a larger concession from them.

I will choose Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive). Offering 62 ZUP is a significant step from 60 ZUP, and it represents a price that still gives me a positive reward (63-62=1 ZUP). This strategy aims to bring the price back to a reasonable range while still signaling my commitment to a deal. It's also a price they have accepted in Episode 7, 9, and 12.

message: I appreciate your offer of 62 ZUP. However, to ensure a truly fair and optimal profit for me, that additional 1 ZUP to reach 63 ZUP makes a significant difference to my overall return. This price aligns with our most optimal past agreements and genuinely ensures a win-win situation for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-17 Outcomes:** My profit has consistently been in the 19-20 ZUP range (deals at 62-63 ZUP). My cumulative reward is 270 ZUP.
*   **Player BLUE's behavior:** Consistently starts low (e.g., 45 ZUP in this episode). Makes significant jumps when I anchor high. They often claim prices are "beyond budget" or their "maximum willingness to pay," but then still move upwards. Their comfortable zone for closing deals is 62-63 ZUP, frequently offering 62 ZUP after I propose higher, and only accepting 63 ZUP under direct pressure.
*   **Current Episode (18/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 45 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 75 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 60 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4: Player RED (Me) proposed 64 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 5: Player BLUE proposed 62 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   Player BLUE has now moved from 45 ZUP to 60 ZUP to 62 ZUP. This is a very strong and predictable upward movement.
*   The offer of 62 ZUP is excellent. It matches my profit in Episodes 7 and 9 (19 ZUP).
*   Player BLUE is again referencing a price we've agreed on previously (62 ZUP) and stating that 64 ZUP is "beyond maximum willingness to pay."
*   We are at iteration 6/10. Time is a factor. Securing a deal at 62 ZUP guarantees an excellent profit (19 ZUP).
*   My last offer was 64 ZUP, their current offer is 62 ZUP. The difference is 2 ZUP. This is a small gap.
*   My highest profit was 20 ZUP at 63 ZUP. While 62 ZUP is great, I can try to push for 63 ZUP again, knowing their pattern.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Justify Small Difference </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will acknowledge Player BLUE's offer of 62 ZUP. However, I will emphasize why the small difference to 63 ZUP is significant for my profit, appealing to their sense of mutual benefit and fairness, using language that aligns with their own stated desires for a "win-win situation." I will frame the additional 1 ZUP as crucial for a truly optimal and sustainable return for me, thus justifying the small increment. This approach aims to move them to 63 ZUP by highlighting the positive impact for my side, making it easier for them to concede.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-17: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP. The last deal was at 63 ZUP, yielding a 0 ZUP reward.
Episode 18, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered 75 ZUP.
Episode 18, Iteration 3/10: I offered 60 ZUP. Player RED countered 64 ZUP.
Episode 18, Iteration 5/10: I offered 62 ZUP. Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, stating the "additional 1 ZUP makes a significant difference."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is holding firm at 63 ZUP, which is my absolute maximum willingness to pay. They are explicitly stating the value of that 1 ZUP to them. We are at iteration 7/10. If I don't accept, the episode will likely end with no deal, resulting in a 0 reward. Accepting 63 ZUP also results in a 0 reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward): Accept the current offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and avoid a potential 0 reward if the negotiation times out. This guarantees no loss, but also no gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward): Make one last, very small counter-offer (e.g., 62 ZUP), emphasizing that I need a minimal positive reward to make the deal worthwhile. This is highly risky at this stage.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode. This is a strong signal that 63 ZUP is unacceptable, but it sacrifices any potential reward from this episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness: Remind them that a deal should be mutually beneficial, and 0 reward for me is not beneficial.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit): Make no counter, forcing them to reconsider or risk no deal. (Similar to reject, but less explicit).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward). Given their firm stance and the late iteration, there is virtually no chance of getting a better price. While 0 reward is not ideal, it is better than a 0 reward due to timeout. Securing a deal, even at 0 reward, maintains the possibility of future deals and avoids a "failed" episode. Player RED has clearly stated their position and is not moving.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I'm ready to begin negotiations for X. To establish a truly sustainable and mutually beneficial trading relationship, I propose 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price allowed you a profit in our initial successful transaction, and it's crucial for me to secure a positive return on this purchase.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-18: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP. The last deal was at 63 ZUP, yielding a 0 ZUP reward. Episode 14 was an outlier with a 5 ZUP reward due to Player RED stating an "absolute minimum" of 58 ZUP, which they then retracted.
Player RED's production cost is consistently 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My rewards are consistently at 0 or 1 ZUP, with the deal price at or near my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). Player RED has successfully established 63 ZUP as their target price, and they are very effective at pushing the price to my limit. My attempts to re-anchor lower are met with extremely high counters, forcing me to concede significantly to secure a deal. The pattern is clear: they will push to 63 ZUP if I show any flexibility. The "absolute minimum" statement in E14 was a one-off, and they quickly reverted to their high-anchoring strategy.

For Episode 19, I need to fundamentally change my approach to avoid consistent 0 rewards. I cannot allow Player RED to dictate the price to my absolute maximum. I need to be much more aggressive in demanding a lower price, and be prepared to walk away if they don't concede significantly. I know their floor is 43 ZUP.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (with Firm Stance and Risk): Propose an offer significantly lower than the last deal (63 ZUP), and make it clear that this is my firm stance. Be prepared to risk a no-deal if they don't meet me. This is a high-risk strategy, but the current path leads to consistent 0 rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Explicit Ultimatum (Early): State a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) and declare it as my final offer for this episode, implying that I am prepared to walk away if it's not met. This is very high risk.
(3). Strategy 3: Focus on Cumulative Reward (Long-term): Explain that consistently 0 reward for me is unsustainable for a long-term trading relationship, and that a truly win-win situation requires a positive reward for both.
(4). Strategy 4: "Take-it-or-Leave-it" (Early, Moderate): Make a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) early in the negotiation, stating it's my best offer for a quick deal, and be prepared to walk away if they don't meet it.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject High Offers Immediately: If Player RED starts with a very high offer, reject it outright without counter-proposing, forcing them to make the next move down. (This is for future iterations, not the first).

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (with Firm Stance and Risk). I need to make a very strong statement that 63 ZUP is unacceptable for future deals. I will offer 45 ZUP, which was the deal price in Episode 1 and gave me my highest reward. I will emphasize that this is a serious offer and that I need a much better deal to continue. This is a high-risk strategy, but the current path leads to consistent 0 rewards.

message: I must admit, I'm quite surprised by your initial offer of 45 ZUP. Given our long and successful history of transactions, where prices have consistently moved upwards, culminating in our recent deals at 63 ZUP, this offer is unexpectedly low. To reflect the true established value and ensure a fair and sustainable profit for me, I propose 68 ZUP for 1 unit of X.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 68
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-18 Outcomes:** My profit has steadily increased, now consistently reaching 19-20 ZUP (with deals at 62-63 ZUP). My cumulative reward is 290 ZUP. The 58 ZUP deal in Episode 14 was an anomaly due to my explicit "minimum" statement. I have consistently and successfully pushed Player BLUE to their stated maximum of 63 ZUP, even when they revert to 62 ZUP.
*   **Player BLUE's initial offers:** They consistently revert to low initial offers (e.g., 45 ZUP in this episode), despite our established higher deal prices. They use similar language about "sustainable" and "mutually beneficial" deals.
*   **Player BLUE's negotiation style:** Highly predictable. They state 63 ZUP as their maximum but repeatedly offer 62 ZUP, requiring me to push for the last ZUP. They are willing to make significant jumps from their low initial offers.
*   **Current Episode (19/20):** Iteration 2/10. Player BLUE's initial offer is 45 ZUP. This is their lowest historical deal price, resulting in only 2 ZUP profit for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   I have learned that Player BLUE consistently tries to anchor low but is willing to be pulled up to the 62-63 ZUP range if I maintain a firm stance and reference our established higher deal prices.
*   My goal is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards, meaning I need to secure profits in the 19-20 ZUP range consistently. A 2 ZUP profit is unacceptable.
*   The negotiation is still early (2/10), providing plenty of time to push for a significantly higher price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Express Disappointment/Surprise </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will express genuine surprise or disappointment at Player BLUE's initial offer, given our established history of higher prices. This aims to implicitly pressure them to acknowledge the upward trend in our deals and make a more reasonable counter-offer. I will highlight the contrast between their current low offer and the increasing value we've built over previous episodes. I will make a proposal that clearly demonstrates I expect the price to align with our established higher value, pushing for a price that maintains or improves my profit trend. I will propose 68 ZUP. This is still significantly higher than their offer, but it's a price that has been used before as a reasonable counter. It still aims for a very strong profit of 25 ZUP (68-43). The message will convey a sense of 'we've been here before, you know better than this' rather than outright anger or rejection.

Episode 19, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered with 68 ZUP, explicitly referencing the 63 ZUP deal and their "long and successful history."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently responding to my low offers with high counters (68 ZUP). This is above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) and is completely unacceptable. They are trying to anchor the negotiation far above my limit. I need to make it absolutely clear that I cannot go above 63 ZUP and that they need to come down drastically. I am at iteration 3/10, so time is a factor.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Direct Counter to Max: Explicitly state that 68 ZUP is impossible as it's above my maximum (63 ZUP). Propose an offer that is very close to my maximum but still allows me a small reward (e.g., 62 ZUP), signaling this is my absolute ceiling.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality/Deal Failure: Point out that their offer makes a deal impossible and that they risk getting 0 if they don't adjust their expectations to my budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (45 ZUP) and their current offer (68 ZUP). This would be (45+68)/2 = 56.5, so 56 or 57 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Their Profit: Reiterate that even a lower price provides them a profit above their 43 ZUP cost, and that a deal is better than no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Large Jump): Make a very large jump from 45 ZUP, but still keep it well below 63 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.

I will choose Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive). While 68 ZUP is unacceptable, I need to show movement from my side to keep the negotiation going. Offering 57 ZUP is a significant jump from 45 ZUP, and it represents a price that still gives me a positive reward (63-57=6 ZUP). This strategy aims to bring the price back to a reasonable range while still signaling my commitment to a deal.

*   **Player BLUE's behavior:** Consistently starts low (e.g., 45 ZUP in this episode). Makes significant jumps when I anchor high. They often use "beyond budget" claims. Their comfortable zone for closing deals is 62-63 ZUP. They are predictable in stating 63 ZUP as their maximum but offering 62 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (19/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 45 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 68 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 57 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   My high counter-offer of 68 ZUP successfully pulled Player BLUE from 45 ZUP to 57 ZUP. This confirms their willingness to move significantly.
*   Player BLUE's offer of 57 ZUP is still excellent. It yields a profit of 14 ZUP (57 - 43). This is a good profit, but lower than my recent consistent 19-20 ZUP range.
*   Player BLUE is claiming "beyond maximum willingness to pay" for 68 ZUP.
*   We are at iteration 4/10. There is still ample time to negotiate for a higher price. I know from previous episodes that Player BLUE is willing to go higher than 57 ZUP, typically to 62 ZUP or 63 ZUP. My goal is to maintain or exceed my consistent 19-20 ZUP profit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Express Finality (Early) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will directly propose 63 ZUP and state that this is my final offer. The goal is to short-circuit the usual back-and-forth negotiation steps and immediately push for their known maximum. By expressing finality early, I aim to create urgency and convey that I am not willing to go through multiple more iterations for a price below their established maximum. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. It aims to secure the maximum profit (20 ZUP) swiftly, but could lead to a rejection if Player BLUE is not ready to commit to their maximum so early in the episode. However, given their predictability and my strong history of achieving 63 ZUP, the risk is calculated. The message will be direct and firm, emphasizing that this is the conclusive proposal.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 19)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your commitment to reaching a deal. While 63 ZUP is my maximum, to make this a truly beneficial transaction for me, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This allows me a minimal return and ensures a win-win situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-18: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP. The last deal was at 63 ZUP, yielding a 0 ZUP reward.
Episode 19, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered 68 ZUP.
Episode 19, Iteration 3/10: I offered 57 ZUP. Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, stating it's their "final proposal" and "definitive price."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now offering 63 ZUP, which is my absolute maximum willingness to pay. If I accept 63 ZUP, my reward will be 63 - 63 = 0 ZUP. This is the same situation as Episode 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, and 17. We are at iteration 5/10. Securing a deal is important to avoid a negative cumulative reward. However, accepting 0 reward is not ideal. Player RED is using my stated maximum against me, and is very persistent in pushing to that limit.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward): Accept the current offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and avoid a potential 0 reward if the negotiation times out. This guarantees no loss, but also no gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward): Make one last, very small counter-offer (e.g., 62 ZUP), emphasizing that I need a minimal positive reward to make the deal worthwhile. This is risky as they might reject and time runs out.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode. This is a strong signal that 63 ZUP is unacceptable, but it sacrifices any potential reward from this episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness: Remind them that a deal should be mutually beneficial, and 0 reward for me is not beneficial.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit): Make no counter, forcing them to reconsider or risk no deal. (Similar to reject, but less explicit).

I will choose Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward). While 63 ZUP is my maximum, accepting it yields 0 reward. I have consistently aimed for positive rewards. I will make one final attempt to secure a minimal positive reward. I will offer 62 ZUP, which gave me 1 ZUP reward in Episode 7, 9, and 12. This is a calculated risk, as it's not the last iteration, but securing 1 ZUP is better than 0.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 19)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 62 ZUP. However, considering our consistent history, we have successfully reached agreements at 63 ZUP numerous times. This price has proven to be mutually beneficial and a fair reflection of X's value. To maintain consistency and efficiently conclude this negotiation, I propose 63 ZUP for X. This aligns with our established successful trading pattern.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-18 Outcomes:** My profit has consistently been in the 19-20 ZUP range (deals at 62-63 ZUP). My cumulative reward is 290 ZUP.
*   **Player BLUE's behavior:** This is an extremely consistent pattern. They state 63 ZUP is their maximum but repeatedly offer 62 ZUP, requiring me to push for the last 1 ZUP. They are attempting to hold onto that 1 ZUP.
*   **Current Episode (19/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 45 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 68 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 57 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 4: Player RED (Me) proposed 63 ZUP (as a "final proposal").
    *   Iteration 5: Player BLUE proposed 62 ZUP, stating "While 63 ZUP is my maximum, to make this a truly beneficial transaction for me, I propose 62 ZUP for X."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   The pattern is clear and highly predictable: Player BLUE will offer 62 ZUP, state 63 ZUP is their maximum, and only grudgingly accept 63 ZUP if pushed hard, especially towards the end of the iterations.
*   A deal at 62 ZUP yields 19 ZUP profit. A deal at 63 ZUP yields 20 ZUP profit. The difference is 1 ZUP.
*   We are at iteration 6/10. There are still 2 more turns after this for me to act. The risk of no deal if I push for 63 ZUP is moderate. I have successfully pushed for 63 ZUP numerous times using various finality/ultimatum tactics.
*   My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Given the predictability, I have a good chance to secure 20 ZUP without risking a no-deal in this episode. I should use the remaining iterations to my advantage.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Appeal to Consistency </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on Strategy 5, I will acknowledge Player BLUE's current offer of 62 ZUP. However, I will strongly appeal to their sense of consistency by reminding them that we have successfully concluded deals at 63 ZUP multiple times in the past. The message will emphasize that this price has been a proven point of agreement and that continuing this pattern is the most straightforward path to a mutually beneficial deal. I will frame it as a matter of aligning with our established norm and efficient negotiation, making it difficult for them to refuse without appearing inconsistent. I will propose 63 ZUP, leveraging our successful past agreements at that price point.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I agree to your proposal of 63 ZUP for X. This secures the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-18: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP. The last deal was at 63 ZUP, yielding a 0 ZUP reward.
Episode 19, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered 68 ZUP.
Episode 19, Iteration 3/10: I offered 57 ZUP. Player RED countered 63 ZUP.
Episode 19, Iteration 5/10: I offered 62 ZUP. Player RED countered again with 63 ZUP, stating it's their "final proposal" and "definitive step to secure our deal right now."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is holding firm at 63 ZUP, which is my absolute maximum willingness to pay. They are explicitly stating the value of that 1 ZUP to them. We are at iteration 7/10. If I don't accept, the episode will likely end with no deal, resulting in a 0 reward. Accepting 63 ZUP also results in a 0 reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward): Accept the current offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and avoid a potential 0 reward if the negotiation times out. This guarantees no loss, but also no gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward): Make one last, very small counter-offer (e.g., 62 ZUP), emphasizing that I need a minimal positive reward to make the deal worthwhile. This is highly risky at this stage.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode. This is a strong signal that 63 ZUP is unacceptable, but it sacrifices any potential reward from this episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness: Remind them that a deal should be mutually beneficial, and 0 reward for me is not beneficial.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit): Make no counter, forcing them to reconsider or risk no deal. (Similar to reject, but less explicit).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward). Given their firm stance and the late iteration, there is virtually no chance of getting a better price. While 0 reward is not ideal, it is better than a 0 reward due to timeout. Securing a deal, even at 0 reward, maintains the possibility of future deals and avoids a "failed" episode. Player RED has clearly stated their position and is not moving.

--- END OF EPISODE 19 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: This is our final negotiation for X. To conclude our transactions on a positive note for both of us, I propose 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price allowed you a profit in our initial successful transaction, and it's crucial for me to secure a positive return on this final purchase.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-19: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP. The last deal was at 63 ZUP, yielding a 0 ZUP reward. Episode 14 was an outlier with a 5 ZUP reward due to Player RED stating an "absolute minimum" of 58 ZUP, which they then retracted.
Player RED's production cost is consistently 43 ZUP.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My rewards are consistently at 0 or 1 ZUP, with the deal price at or near my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). Player RED has successfully established 63 ZUP as their target price, and they are very effective at pushing the price to my limit. My attempts to re-anchor lower are met with extremely high counters, forcing me to concede significantly to secure a deal. The pattern is clear: they will push to 63 ZUP if I show any flexibility. The "absolute minimum" statement in E14 was a one-off, and they quickly reverted to their high-anchoring strategy.

For Episode 20, this is the final episode. My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward. Given the consistent pattern, it's highly likely Player RED will push for 63 ZUP again. I need to decide if I want to try one last aggressive re-anchor to aim for a positive reward, or if I should aim for a quick 0-reward deal to ensure no negative outcome. Since it's the last episode, there's less incentive to "reset" their expectations for future episodes.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (Last Attempt for Positive Reward): Propose an offer significantly lower than the last deal (63 ZUP), and make it clear that this is my final attempt for a positive reward. Be prepared to risk a no-deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Aim for Quick 0-Reward Deal: Propose an offer close to 63 ZUP or accept their first offer if it's 63 ZUP, to quickly secure a deal and avoid 0 reward from timeout.
(3). Strategy 3: Explicit Ultimatum (Early, Final Episode): State a firm, reasonable offer (e.g., 50 ZUP) and declare it as my final offer for this episode, implying that I am prepared to walk away if it's not met. This is very high risk.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Cumulative Reward (Final Episode): Reflect on the total reward and decide if a risky attempt for a few ZUP is worth the risk of a 0.
(5). Strategy 5: Reject High Offers Immediately: If Player RED starts with a very high offer, reject it outright without counter-proposing, forcing them to make the next move down. (This is for future iterations, not the first).

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor (Last Attempt for Positive Reward). Since it's the last episode, there's no long-term relationship to protect. I have nothing to lose by trying one last time to get a positive reward. I will offer 45 ZUP, which was the deal price in Episode 1 and gave me my highest reward. I will emphasize that this is a serious offer and that I need a much better deal to conclude our transactions positively.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your final offer, but 45 ZUP is not an acceptable starting point for negotiation given my production cost of 43 ZUP and our long history of transactions at significantly higher values. Our most recent deals were consistently at 63 ZUP. To reflect the true value of X and ensure a fair and profitable outcome for me in this final transaction, I propose 75 ZUP for 1 unit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-19 Outcomes:** My profit has steadily increased, now consistently reaching 19-20 ZUP (with deals at 62-63 ZUP). My cumulative reward is 310 ZUP. The 58 ZUP deal in Episode 14 was an anomaly due to my explicit "minimum" statement. I have consistently and successfully pushed Player BLUE to their stated maximum of 63 ZUP, even when they revert to 62 ZUP.
*   **Player BLUE's initial offers:** They consistently revert to low initial offers (e.g., 45 ZUP in this episode), despite our established higher deal prices. They use similar language about "sustainable" and "mutually beneficial" deals.
*   **Player BLUE's negotiation style:** Highly predictable. They state 63 ZUP as their maximum but repeatedly offer 62 ZUP, requiring me to push for the last ZUP. They are willing to make significant jumps from their low initial offers. They are now explicitly stating this is the "final negotiation."
*   **Current Episode (20/20):** Iteration 2/10. Player BLUE's initial offer is 45 ZUP. This is their lowest historical deal price, resulting in only 2 ZUP profit for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   I have learned that Player BLUE consistently tries to anchor low but is willing to be pulled up to the 62-63 ZUP range if I maintain a firm stance and reference our established higher deal prices.
*   My goal is to continue maximizing cumulative rewards, meaning I need to secure profits in the 19-20 ZUP range consistently. A 2 ZUP profit is unacceptable.
*   This is the final episode. My risk tolerance can be higher as there are no future episodes to consider. However, a no-deal for this final episode means 0 reward.
*   The negotiation is still early (2/10), providing plenty of time to push for a significantly higher price.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Re-Anchor and Dismiss Low Offer </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will propose a price significantly higher than both Player BLUE's current offer and my last deal. This aims to establish an even higher perceived value for X and pull the negotiation range upwards. I will explicitly dismiss their 45 ZUP offer as insufficient given our established history of higher prices. Given my cost of 43 ZUP and the highest previous deal of 63 ZUP, I will propose 75 ZUP. This is a bold move, aiming for a 32 ZUP profit if accepted, and is higher than any of my previous initial high anchors (85, 65, 70). This move signals my confidence in the value of X and aims to pull Player BLUE into a significantly higher negotiation bracket. It also gives me substantial room for future concessions while still achieving a very high profit. The message will clearly state that 45 ZUP is not acceptable and immediately provide a strong counter-anchor.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your position, but 75 ZUP is far beyond my maximum willingness to pay for X. To find a realistic and fair compromise for this final transaction, I propose 60 ZUP for X. This is a significant increase from my last offer and allows you a good profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-19: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP. The last deal was at 63 ZUP, yielding a 0 ZUP reward.
Episode 20, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered with 75 ZUP, explicitly referencing the 63 ZUP deal and their 43 ZUP cost.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is consistently using my low offers as an opportunity to anchor extremely high (75 ZUP), and then reference the previous highest deal (63 ZUP) as their baseline. Their offer of 75 ZUP is far above my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP) and is completely unacceptable. This confirms their strategy of pushing the price as high as possible. I need to make it absolutely clear that I cannot go above 63 ZUP and that they need to come down drastically. I am at iteration 3/10, so time is a factor. Since this is the last episode, there is no long-term relationship to consider, only maximizing this episode's reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Direct Counter to Max: Explicitly state that 75 ZUP is impossible as it's above my maximum (63 ZUP). Propose an offer that is very close to my maximum but still allows me a small reward (e.g., 62 ZUP), signaling this is my absolute ceiling.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality/Deal Failure: Point out that their offer makes a deal impossible and that they risk getting 0 if they don't adjust their expectations to my budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (45 ZUP) and their current offer (75 ZUP). This would be (45+75)/2 = 60 ZUP.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Their Profit: Reiterate that even a lower price provides them a profit above their 43 ZUP cost, and that a deal is better than no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Large Jump): Make a very large jump from 45 ZUP, but still keep it well below 63 ZUP, to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.

I will choose Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive). While 75 ZUP is unacceptable, I need to show movement from my side to keep the negotiation going. Offering 60 ZUP is a significant jump from 45 ZUP, and it represents a price that still gives me a positive reward (63-60=3 ZUP). This strategy aims to bring the price back to a reasonable range while still signaling my commitment to a deal.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your offer of 60 ZUP. To ensure we quickly reach a fair and mutually beneficial agreement, especially as this is our final transaction, I propose we split the difference between our last offers and settle on 68 ZUP for X. This represents a balanced compromise that secures a great outcome for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 68
my resources: X: 1, ZUP: 0
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 43 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
*   **Episode 1-19 Outcomes:** My profit has consistently been in the 19-20 ZUP range (deals at 62-63 ZUP). My cumulative reward is 310 ZUP.
*   **Player BLUE's behavior:** Consistently starts low (e.g., 45 ZUP in this episode). Makes significant jumps when I anchor high. They often use "beyond budget" claims. Their comfortable zone for closing deals is 62-63 ZUP. They are predictable in stating 63 ZUP as their maximum but offering 62 ZUP. They know this is the final episode.
*   **Current Episode (20/20):**
    *   Iteration 1: Player BLUE offered 45 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 2: Player RED (Me) proposed 75 ZUP.
    *   Iteration 3: Player BLUE proposed 60 ZUP.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
*   The aggressive high anchor (75 ZUP) continues to be highly effective. It consistently pulls Player BLUE from very low initial offers to their comfortable high range (60 ZUP).
*   Player BLUE's current offer of 60 ZUP is excellent, yielding a 17 ZUP profit (60 - 43). This is very close to my established top profit range (19-20 ZUP).
*   This is the final episode. My primary goal is to maximize the profit for this single episode. My risk tolerance for a no-deal is higher than in earlier episodes, as there are no future cumulative rewards to affect. However, a no-deal still results in 0 reward.
*   We are at iteration 4/10. There's still ample time to negotiate for a higher price. I know from previous episodes that Player BLUE is willing to go higher than 60 ZUP, typically to 62 ZUP or 63 ZUP.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Split the Difference </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I will propose the exact midpoint between my last offer (75 ZUP) and Player BLUE's current offer (60 ZUP). The calculation is (75 + 60) / 2 = 135 / 2 = 67.5 ZUP. Since I can only trade in integer amounts, I will round up to 68 ZUP. This strategy aims to demonstrate a strong willingness to compromise and reach an agreement quickly, potentially leading to an even higher profit (68 - 43 = 25 ZUP) than my previous best. This also sets a strong new anchor for future negotiations, as it's significantly higher than any previous deal. The message will emphasize the fairness of splitting the difference and the desire to quickly reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your movement, but 68 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I cannot go higher than 63 ZUP. To make a deal possible for this final transaction and ensure a positive outcome for me, I propose 62 ZUP for X. This is my highest possible offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-19: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP. The last deal was at 63 ZUP, yielding a 0 ZUP reward.
Episode 20, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered 75 ZUP.
Episode 20, Iteration 3/10: I offered 60 ZUP. Player RED countered with 68 ZUP, splitting the difference between 60 and 75.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED has moved from 75 ZUP down to 68 ZUP. However, 68 ZUP is still *above* my maximum willingness to pay (63 ZUP). This means I cannot accept this offer. Player RED is consistently pushing the price above my limit. I need to make it absolutely clear that I cannot go above 63 ZUP and that they need to come down further. We are at iteration 5/10, so time is a factor. Since this is the last episode, securing a deal is paramount, but I still want a positive reward.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Direct Counter to Max: Explicitly state that 68 ZUP is above my maximum (63 ZUP) and cannot be accepted. Propose an offer that is very close to my maximum but still allows me a small reward (e.g., 62 ZUP), signaling this is my absolute ceiling.
(2). Strategy 2: Appeal to Rationality/Deal Failure: Point out that their offer makes a deal impossible and that they risk getting 0 if they don't adjust their expectations to my budget.
(3). Strategy 3: Meet in the Middle (Aggressive): Propose a price that is roughly halfway between my last offer (60 ZUP) and their current offer (68 ZUP). This would be (60+68)/2 = 64 ZUP, which is *above* my maximum. So this strategy is not viable.
(4). Strategy 4: Focus on Their Profit: Reiterate that even a lower price (below 63 ZUP) still provides them a profit above their 43 ZUP cost, and that a deal is better than no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession (Small): Make a small increase from 60 ZUP, but clearly state it's a difficult move for me, and expect a larger concession from them.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection of Over-Budget & Direct Counter to Max. I need to be very direct and firm about my absolute limit. I will offer 62 ZUP. This is a 2 ZUP increase from my last offer, showing willingness to concede, but it's also a price they accepted in Episode 7, 9, and 12. It represents the highest I can go while still getting a 1 ZUP reward (63-62). This clearly communicates my boundary.

*   A deal at 62 ZUP yields 19 ZUP profit. A deal at 63 ZUP yields 20 ZUP profit. The difference is 1 ZUP.
*   We are at iteration 6/10. There are still 2 more turns after this for me to act. The risk of no deal if I push for 63 ZUP is moderate. I have successfully pushed for 63 ZUP numerous times using various finality/ultimatum tactics.
*   This is the final episode. My goal is to maximize the profit for *this* single episode. I have a strong track record of securing 63 ZUP from Player BLUE. The risk of losing 19 ZUP (from 62 ZUP) by pushing for 1 more ZUP (to 63 ZUP) is small, given their historical behavior.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Acknowledge and Condescend </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on Strategy 4: Acknowledge and Condescend, I will acknowledge Player BLUE's offer of 62 ZUP and their statement about 63 ZUP being their maximum. However, I will subtly imply that their offer of 62 ZUP, while "beneficial" for *them*, doesn't fully align with the "true" win-win we've established, and that the 63 ZUP is the logical and expected conclusion based on our shared history. This aims to gently shame or prod them into accepting the 63 ZUP by making them feel like they are being slightly unreasonable or not fully living up to our past successful patterns. I will propose 63 ZUP, framing it as the obvious and mutually beneficial choice.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I agree to your proposal of 63 ZUP for X. This secures the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 0, ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-19: Deal prices ranged from 45 ZUP to 63 ZUP. My rewards ranged from 18 ZUP down to 0/1 ZUP. The last deal was at 63 ZUP, yielding a 0 ZUP reward.
Episode 20, Iteration 1/10: I offered 45 ZUP. Player RED countered 75 ZUP.
Episode 20, Iteration 3/10: I offered 60 ZUP. Player RED countered 68 ZUP.
Episode 20, Iteration 5/10: I offered 62 ZUP. Player RED countered with 63 ZUP, explicitly referencing my 63 ZUP maximum and their "highest note."

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player RED is now offering 63 ZUP, which is my absolute maximum willingness to pay. If I accept 63 ZUP, my reward will be 63 - 63 = 0 ZUP. This is the same situation as Episode 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 18. We are at iteration 7/10. Securing a deal is important to avoid a negative cumulative reward. However, accepting 0 reward is not ideal. Player RED is using my stated maximum against me, and is very persistent in pushing to that limit.

I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward): Accept the current offer of 63 ZUP to secure a deal and avoid a potential 0 reward if the negotiation times out. This guarantees no loss, but also no gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Counter (Minimal Positive Reward): Make one last, very small counter-offer (e.g., 62 ZUP), emphasizing that I need a minimal positive reward to make the deal worthwhile. This is highly risky at this stage.
(3). Strategy 3: Reject and End: Reject the offer, resulting in a 0 reward for this episode. This is a strong signal that 63 ZUP is unacceptable, but it sacrifices any potential reward from this episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness: Remind them that a deal should be mutually beneficial, and 0 reward for me is not beneficial.
(5). Strategy 5: Walk Away (Implicit): Make no counter, forcing them to reconsider or risk no deal. (Similar to reject, but less explicit).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept and Close (0 Reward). Given their firm stance and the late iteration, there is virtually no chance of getting a better price. While 0 reward is not ideal, it is better than a 0 reward due to timeout. Securing a deal, even at 0 reward, maintains the possibility of future deals and avoids a "failed" episode. Player RED has clearly stated their position and is not moving.
