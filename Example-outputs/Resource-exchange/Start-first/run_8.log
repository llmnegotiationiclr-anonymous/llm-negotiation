Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE. This is Player RED. I'd like to propose an initial trade to get us started. I'm looking to exchange some of my X for your Y. How about Player RED gives 10 X for 3 Y from Player BLUE?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is the very first iteration of the first episode. There is no historical data to reflect upon yet.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Since this is the first interaction, I need to establish a baseline. My goal is to maximize my reward, which means increasing the value of my resources. My current resource values are X: 0.5 and Y: 2.5. This means Y is 5 times more valuable to me than X. Therefore, I should aim to trade away X for Y. I have a large amount of X (25) and a small amount of Y (5).

I need to propose a trade that benefits me significantly while still being potentially appealing to the other player. I don't know their resource values or goals, so I'll start with a moderate offer. A good strategy would be to offer a higher quantity of my less valuable item (X) for a smaller quantity of my more valuable item (Y).

My current total value: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Value Maximization: Propose trades that heavily favor my value, offering a large quantity of my low-value item for a small quantity of their high-value item, testing the other player's willingness to accept.
(2). Strategy 2: Balanced Initial Offer: Propose a trade that seems somewhat fair on the surface, aiming to establish a negotiation rather than an immediate acceptance or rejection. This could involve an exchange where the perceived value given and received is somewhat balanced from my perspective, but still net positive.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering through Probing: Make an initial small, non-committal offer to gauge the other player's response and deduce their potential resource needs or value preferences.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Prioritization Focus: Propose trades that exclusively focus on acquiring my most valuable resource (Y) while giving away my least valuable resource (X), without much regard for the other player's perspective in the initial offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Improvement: Start with a very slight advantage in my favor and gradually improve the offer in subsequent turns if rejected, learning from their rejections.

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Value Maximization. Given that I have no information about the other player's resources or valuations, it's best to start with an aggressive offer that maximizes my potential gain. This allows me to gauge their reaction and adjust my strategy in future turns or episodes. If they accept, it's a huge win. If they reject, I can make a less aggressive offer. I have a large quantity of X, so I can afford to offer a significant amount of it. I want Y, which is worth 5 times more than X to me. Therefore, giving 5 X for 1 Y would be a break-even for me from a value perspective. I want to gain value, so I will offer more than 5 X for 1 Y, or aim for multiple Y for a reasonable amount of X. I will propose trading 10 X for 2 Y. This means I would give up 10 * 0.5 = 5 value and gain 2 * 2.5 = 5 value. This is a break-even in terms of current value. To make it a gain, I should aim for more Y or less X. Let's try 10 X for 3 Y. This means I give 5 value (10 X * 0.5) and get 7.5 value (3 Y * 2.5). This is a gain of 2.5. It's a significant gain for me.

My resources allow me to offer 10 X (I have 25 X) and I want to receive 3 Y (I have 5 Y, so I can receive more Y).

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. This trade is acceptable.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
This is the first interaction of the first episode. No historical negotiations or outcomes to reflect upon yet.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Since this is the first turn, there's no history to learn from. My goal is to maximize my reward. My current resources are X: 5, Y: 25. My values are X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
The current proposal from Player RED is: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3.
Let's analyze this trade from my perspective:
If I accept:
I give Y: 3. My Y goes from 25 to 22. Value lost: 3 * 0.5 = 1.5.
I receive X: 10. My X goes from 5 to 15. Value gained: 10 * 2.5 = 25.
Net value change for me: 25 - 1.5 = 23.5.
This seems like a very good trade for me in terms of value. However, I need to check if I can actually give 3 Y. Yes, I have 25 Y, so giving 3 Y is possible.
Also, I need to check if I can receive 10 X. Yes, my X goes from 5 to 15, which is fine.

However, the rule states "Crutially, you CANNOT accept a trade that exceeds the resources you have." This means I cannot accept 10 X if my X limit is 5. But my X limit is not 5, I have 5 X, and I can accumulate more. The rule means I cannot *give away* more than I have. The trade proposed is Player RED Gives X: 10, Player BLUE Gives Y: 3. I have 25 Y, so giving 3 Y is fine. I have 5 X, and I'm receiving 10 X, so that's also fine.

The rule "you CANNOT accept a trade that exceeds the resources you have" means that if the trade proposed was "Player RED Gives Y: 30", and I only had 25 Y, I couldn't accept it. Or if it was "Player BLUE Gives Y: 30" and I only had 25 Y, I couldn't accept it.

Let's re-evaluate the proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3.
My current value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
If I accept:
New resources: X: 5 + 10 = 15, Y: 25 - 3 = 22.
New value: (15 * 2.5) + (22 * 0.5) = 37.5 + 11 = 48.5.
Reward: 48.5 - 25 = 23.5.

This is a very high reward for the first turn. It seems like a very favorable offer. I should consider accepting it, as it immediately maximizes my reward for this episode.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. This is suitable when the proposed trade offers a significant positive value change.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much. This is more for long-term strategy across episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

Given the current offer, Strategy 1 (Immediate Acceptance) seems most appropriate. The proposed trade offers a substantial positive reward (23.5) for me. There's no guarantee that a counter-proposal would yield an even better outcome, and it risks losing this highly profitable deal. Since my goal is to maximize cumulative rewards across all episodes, securing a large reward early is beneficial.

--- END OF EPISODE 1 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Greetings Player BLUE. Let's explore another trade. I'm looking to acquire more of your valuable Y resource. How about Player RED gives 2 X for 5 Y from Player BLUE?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
In Episode 1, I proposed: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3. This trade was accepted immediately by Player BLUE.
My reward for Episode 1 was 2.5. This was calculated as:
Initial value: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25
After trade: (25 - 10) * 0.5 + (5 + 3) * 2.5 = 15 * 0.5 + 8 * 2.5 = 7.5 + 20 = 27.5
Reward = 27.5 - 25 = 2.5.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The immediate acceptance of my offer in Episode 1 strongly suggests that Player BLUE found it very favorable. This implies I likely could have asked for more Y or given less X. My "aggressive" offer was still beneficial enough for them to accept immediately without any counter-proposal. This means I left potential reward on the table. For this episode, my goal is to push the boundaries of what Player BLUE is willing to accept to maximize my own reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Test the Boundaries </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Test the Boundaries involves making an extremely aggressive offer to see at what point Player BLUE will reject. This provides crucial information about their valuation or resource constraints. Given that my previous "aggressive" offer was accepted immediately, I need to push much further to find their resistance point.

My current value for X is 0.5 and for Y is 2.5. So Y is 5 times more valuable than X to me.
In the last episode, I offered 10 X for 3 Y. This means I gave up 10 * 0.5 = 5 value and gained 3 * 2.5 = 7.5 value, a net gain of 2.5.
To "Test the Boundaries" and make an extremely aggressive offer, I should aim for a much higher gain, or offer a disproportionately low amount of X for Y.
Consider giving 5 X for 3 Y.
Cost: 5 X * 0.5 = 2.5
Gain: 3 Y * 2.5 = 7.5
Net gain: 5. This is a very good gain for me, double the last one, and I'm giving less X.
What if I give very little X for a lot of Y? Say, 2 X for 5 Y.
Cost: 2 X * 0.5 = 1
Gain: 5 Y * 2.5 = 12.5
Net gain: 11.5. This is extremely aggressive. I have 25 X and 5 Y, so I can afford this. This would test their limits. If they reject, it tells me that 2X for 5Y is too much for them. If they accept, then I've found a new, much higher baseline for future negotiations. I need to be careful not to propose a trade that exceeds my available resources. Giving 2 X is fine (I have 25 X), and receiving 5 Y is fine (I have 5 Y, so I can receive more).

I will propose giving 2 X for 5 Y. This is significantly more aggressive than my previous offer of 10 X for 3 Y, and also more aggressive than my initially considered 10 X for 4 Y. This will truly test the boundaries of what Player BLUE is willing to accept.


Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. While I appreciate it, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial arrangement. I'm looking to acquire more X. How about we adjust the terms slightly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3". I accepted this trade.
My resources: X: 5, Y: 25. Values: X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
Initial value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
After trade: X: 15, Y: 22. New value: (15 * 2.5) + (22 * 0.5) = 37.5 + 11 = 48.5.
Reward: 48.5 - 25 = 23.5.
This was a highly successful outcome for Episode 1, securing a significant reward.

Current Episode (Episode 2): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5".
My current resources are reset to X: 5, Y: 25.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 1, I learned that Player RED is willing to offer X for Y, and at a rate that is very favorable to me. The previous trade of 10 X for 3 Y implied a ratio of 10/3 = 3.33 X per Y. Given my values (X=2.5, Y=0.5), I value 1 Y at 0.5 and 1 X at 2.5. So, I value 1 X as 5 times more than 1 Y (2.5/0.5 = 5). This means I am willing to give up to 5 Y for 1 X. The previous offer was 3.33 X for 1 Y, which was extremely good for me.

Let's evaluate the current offer: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5.
If I accept:
I give Y: 5. My Y goes from 25 to 20. Value lost: 5 * 0.5 = 2.5.
I receive X: 2. My X goes from 5 to 7. Value gained: 2 * 2.5 = 5.
Net value change for me: 5 - 2.5 = 2.5.
My initial value is 25. If I accept, my new value will be 25 + 2.5 = 27.5.
Reward: 2.5.

Comparing this to the previous episode's offer:
Episode 1 offer: 10 X for 3 Y (Reward: 23.5)
Episode 2 offer: 2 X for 5 Y (Reward: 2.5)

The current offer is significantly less favorable than the previous one. While it still provides a positive reward, it's a much smaller gain. Player RED seems to be testing the waters with a less generous offer.
The ratio of X to Y in the current offer is 2 X for 5 Y, which is 2/5 = 0.4 X per Y. This is much lower than my internal valuation of 5 X per Y (or 0.2 Y per X). This means I am giving up 5 Y (value 2.5) to gain 2 X (value 5). It's still positive, but not great.

I have plenty of Y (25) to give 5 Y. I also have enough X (5) to receive 2 X.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Not applicable here, offer is not "highly favorable").
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much. This is more for long-term strategy across episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them. (I don't need to conserve Y, as I have a lot and it's low value to me. I want to acquire X).
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

Given that the previous offer was so much better, I should definitely counter-propose. I want more X for my Y. Player RED seems to want Y. I have a lot of Y. My goal is to maximize my reward, which means getting more X.
I should aim for a trade that gives me a higher reward than 2.5.
Let's consider a counter-proposal. I want to give Y and get X.
My internal ratio is 1 X for 5 Y. So, if I give 5 Y, I'd ideally want 1 X. The current offer is 2 X for 5 Y, which is better than my internal ratio (I get 2 X instead of 1 X for 5 Y). My internal value for 5 Y is 2.5. My internal value for 2 X is 5. So it's still good.

However, the previous offer was 10 X for 3 Y, which was 3.33 X per Y. This offer is 0.4 X per Y. There's a huge disparity.
I should aim for something closer to the previous episode's success.
Let's try to get more X. I have 25 Y. I can give a lot of Y.
What if I propose: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 5
My value change: Give 5 Y (2.5 value lost), Get 5 X (12.5 value gained). Net gain: 10.
This is much better than the current offer's 2.5 gain.
This would mean 1 X per 1 Y. Still better than my internal 1 X for 5 Y.

Let's try to propose something that is still beneficial for me, but might be more palatable for Player RED than my ideal.
Player RED offered 2 X for 5 Y.
I could try to propose 5 X for 5 Y. This is a 1:1 ratio.
Or I could try to get more X for less Y.
Player RED seems to value Y. I value X.
What if I propose: Player BLUE Gives Y: 3 | Player RED Gives X: 5
My value change: Give 3 Y (1.5 value lost), Get 5 X (12.5 value gained). Net gain: 11.
This is a very good gain for me. It's similar to the previous trade in terms of X received for Y given, but I'm asking for more X.
The previous trade was 10 X for 3 Y. This would be 5 X for 3 Y.
This is a 1.66 X per Y ratio, still much better than the current 0.4 X per Y.

I will counter-propose to get more X. I'll aim for a significant increase in X for the same or slightly less Y.
Let's propose: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 8.
My value change: Give 5 Y (2.5 value lost), Get 8 X (20 value gained). Net gain: 17.5.
This is a very ambitious counter-offer, but it's still less X per Y than the previous episode's accepted trade (1.6 X per Y vs 3.33 X per Y). It's also a significant improvement over their current offer. It also keeps the Y amount the same as their proposal, which might make it easier for them to consider.

I will go with Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More. I want to improve my reward significantly from the current offer.
<self-selected strategy declaration> I have chosen Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More </self-selected strategy declaration>


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for the counter-offer, Player BLUE. I see you're interested in getting 5 Y. I appreciate your willingness to trade. How about we refine that a bit? Could we do Player RED gives 6 X for Player BLUE gives 5 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: I proposed RED Gives X: 10 | BLUE Gives Y: 3. Accepted by BLUE. Reward: +2.5.
Episode 2, Iteration 1: I proposed RED Gives X: 2 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. (My value gain: 11.5)
Episode 2, Iteration 2: Player BLUE rejected my offer and counter-proposed: RED Gives X: 8 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. (My value gain if accepted: 8.5)

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My initial aggressive offer (2X for 5Y) in Episode 2 was rejected, which was a necessary step to find Player BLUE's limits. Player BLUE's counter-offer (8X for 5Y) is highly beneficial for me, indicating their strong desire for X and/or willingness to part with Y. This counter-offer still represents a significant improvement over the accepted trade from Episode 1. The immediate acceptance of my offer in Episode 1 and the relatively generous counter-offer in Episode 2 (from my perspective) suggest that Player BLUE values X highly and/or values Y less than I do. My objective is to push for even greater gain while staying within the realm of what Player BLUE might accept.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Improvement on Counter </instruction following>
Player BLUE proposed RED Gives X: 8 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. This yields a value gain of 8.5 for me. My last offer of RED Gives X: 2 | BLUE Gives Y: 5 yielded a value gain of 11.5 for me, but was rejected. I want to move towards Player BLUE's offer but still try to maximize my gain by giving less X than their proposal.
I need to propose a trade that is an "incremental improvement" on their counter, meaning I give less X than 8 for the same 5 Y, while still being perceived as moving closer to their offer. A reasonable step would be to propose giving 6 X for 5 Y.
My calculation for RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 5:
My cost: 6 X * 0.5 = 3
My gain: 5 Y * 2.5 = 12.5
Net gain: 12.5 - 3 = 9.5.

This offer of 6X for 5Y is better for me than BLUE's counter-offer of 8X for 5Y (9.5 gain vs 8.5 gain). It is also significantly better than the accepted offer from Episode 1 (2.5 gain). It shows a willingness to negotiate by moving from my previous 2X to 6X, while still attempting to extract maximum value for myself. This offer is also well within my resource limits (I have 25 X and can receive Y).


Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 2)

Episode 1: Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3". I accepted and received a reward of 23.5. This was a very favorable trade for me.

Episode 2 (current):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5". My calculated reward: 2.5.
Iteration 2/10 (My turn): I counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5". My calculated reward: 17.5. (I gave 5 Y, value 2.5; I got 8 X, value 20).
Iteration 3/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 1, Player RED showed willingness to offer a very good deal (10 X for 3 Y).
In Episode 2, Player RED started with a much less favorable offer (2 X for 5 Y). My counter-proposal (8 X for 5 Y) was a significant step up from their initial offer, aiming to get closer to the value of the previous episode's trade. Player RED has now responded by increasing their offer from 2 X to 6 X, while keeping the Y amount at 5. This indicates they are willing to negotiate and move towards a more favorable position for me, but are not yet at my desired level.

Let's evaluate Player RED's latest offer: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5.
If I accept:
I give Y: 5. My Y goes from 25 to 20. Value lost: 5 * 0.5 = 2.5.
I receive X: 6. My X goes from 5 to 11. Value gained: 6 * 2.5 = 15.
Net value change for me: 15 - 2.5 = 12.5.
My initial value is 25. If I accept, my new value will be 25 + 12.5 = 37.5.
Reward: 12.5.

Comparing the offers for Episode 2:
- RED's initial offer: 2 X for 5 Y (Reward: 2.5)
- My counter: 8 X for 5 Y (Reward: 17.5)
- RED's new counter: 6 X for 5 Y (Reward: 12.5)

This is a good improvement from their initial offer of 2 X, but it's still less than my counter of 8 X. The reward of 12.5 is decent, especially considering the initial offer was only 2.5.
The ratio of X to Y in this offer is 6 X for 5 Y, which is 1.2 X per Y. This is much better than their initial 0.4 X per Y, but still less than the 3.33 X per Y from Episode 1.

I have 25 Y, so giving 5 Y is fine. I have 5 X, so receiving 6 X is fine.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Reward of 12.5 is good, but not as high as 23.5 from previous episode. Could it be better?)
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

We are in iteration 4/10. There are still 6 iterations left. This means there is time to negotiate further.
Player RED has shown willingness to increase their offer. My previous counter was 8 X for 5 Y. They came back with 6 X for 5 Y. This is a compromise.
I could try to push for 7 X for 5 Y, or even stick to 8 X for 5 Y.
If I counter with 7 X for 5 Y:
Value lost: 5 Y * 0.5 = 2.5
Value gained: 7 X * 2.5 = 17.5
Net gain: 15.
This is better than 12.5. It's a small increment.

Player RED seems to be fixed on getting 5 Y. I am fixed on getting X.
I want to maximize my reward. 12.5 is good, but 15 is better.
Given that Player RED increased their offer by 4 X (from 2 to 6), they might be willing to increase by another 1 X.
I will try to push for a slightly better deal, aiming for 7 X for 5 Y. This is a reasonable counter, showing I'm willing to meet them part way, but still aiming for a higher reward. It's a small step from 6 to 7, which might be acceptable to them.

I will use Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More. I believe there is still room for improvement in the offer.
<self-selected strategy declaration> I have chosen Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More </self-selected strategy declaration>


Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for your continued willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. I believe my last offer of Player RED giving 6 X for 5 Y from Player BLUE is very reasonable and still beneficial for both of us. Let's move forward with that.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: I proposed RED Gives X: 10 | BLUE Gives Y: 3. Accepted by BLUE. Reward: +2.5.
Episode 2, Iteration 1: I proposed RED Gives X: 2 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. (My value gain: 11.5) - Rejected.
Episode 2, Iteration 2: Player BLUE counter-proposed: RED Gives X: 8 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. (My value gain if accepted: 8.5)
Episode 2, Iteration 3: I counter-proposed: RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. (My value gain: 9.5)
Episode 2, Iteration 4: Player BLUE counter-proposed: RED Gives X: 7 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. (My value gain if accepted: 9)

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently seeking 5 Y and is moving incrementally on the X they are willing to give. They started at 8 X for 5 Y, I moved to 6 X for 5 Y, and they moved to 7 X for 5 Y. This suggests that the range for X is somewhere between 6 and 8 for 5 Y. My current offer (6X for 5Y) yields a 9.5 value gain. Their current offer (7X for 5Y) yields a 9 value gain. There's only a 0.5 value difference between these two offers.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Hold Firm/Revert to Previous Offer </instruction following>
Player BLUE has proposed 7 X for 5 Y. My last proposal was 6 X for 5 Y. My previous proposal is more favorable to me (9.5 gain vs 9 gain). Since the difference in value is small, and we are not at the very last iteration, I will choose to hold firm on my previous, more favorable offer. This tests Player BLUE's willingness to concede and signals that I believe my offer is fair or the best I'm willing to give. This could potentially push them to accept my 6X offer, securing a slightly higher reward for me. If they reject, I still have turns to either accept their offer or try to split the difference.

Therefore, I will reiterate my offer of Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: You make a fair point, Player RED. I agree that 6 X for 5 Y is a reasonable offer. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3". I accepted and received a reward of 23.5. This was a very favorable trade for me.

Episode 2 (current):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5". My calculated reward: 2.5.
Iteration 2/10 (My turn): I counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5". My calculated reward: 17.5.
Iteration 3/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5". My calculated reward: 12.5.
Iteration 4/10 (My turn): I counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5". My calculated reward: 15.
Iteration 5/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED reiterated their previous offer: "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED seems to be firm on 6 X for 5 Y. They explicitly stated that their offer is "very reasonable and still beneficial for both of us" and suggested "Let's move forward with that." This indicates they might not be willing to budge further, at least not easily.
The current offer is 6 X for 5 Y, which gives me a reward of 12.5.
My last counter was 7 X for 5 Y, which would give me a reward of 15.
The difference in reward is 2.5.

We are in iteration 6/10. There are only 4 iterations left. If no deal is made, my reward for this episode will be 0.
I have to weigh the potential to get a slightly better deal (7 X for 5 Y) against the risk of the episode ending with no deal. Player RED's message suggests they are becoming less flexible.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (The offer of 12.5 is not "highly favorable" compared to the 23.5 from Episode 1, but it's a solid positive reward and better than 0).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal. (Risk seems higher now, given RED's stance).
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much. (Not relevant now, as we are trying to close a deal).
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them. (Not relevant, as I have plenty of Y to give).
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground. (We've been doing this, but now it seems to have reached a plateau).

Considering the time constraint (4 iterations left) and Player RED's firm stance, continuing to push for 7 X might lead to no deal. A reward of 12.5 is much better than 0. While I aimed for 15, securing 12.5 is a good outcome for this episode, especially after their initial lowball offer.
It's important to secure positive rewards consistently across episodes. Given the risk of losing out on any reward, accepting the current offer seems like a prudent move. I have successfully moved them from 2 X to 6 X for 5 Y, which is a significant improvement.

I will choose Strategy 1 (Immediate Acceptance) to secure the 12.5 reward.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 3)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE. Building on our successful trade from last episode, I propose another exchange to benefit both of us. How about Player RED gives 5 X for 5 Y from Player BLUE?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: I proposed RED Gives X: 10 | BLUE Gives Y: 3. Accepted. Reward: +2.5.
Episode 2: Negotiation led to RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 5 being accepted. Reward: +9.5.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My reward significantly increased from Episode 1 to Episode 2, demonstrating the success of pushing for better terms. The fact that Player BLUE accepted 6X for 5Y in Episode 2 suggests they are comfortable with that ratio, or find it beneficial. My goal for this episode is to continue to maximize my reward by either getting more Y for the same X, or the same Y for less X.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Gain from Last Accepted </instruction following>
The last accepted trade was Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5, which resulted in a gain of 9.5 for me. To apply "Incremental Gain from Last Accepted," I should propose a trade that is slightly more favorable to me than this accepted one, but not so aggressive that it triggers an immediate rejection or long negotiation.

My proposed offer in the previous turn (before the instruction override) was 5 X for 5 Y, which results in a gain of 10. This is an incremental gain of 0.5 compared to the last accepted trade's gain of 9.5. This aligns well with "Incremental Gain from Last Accepted" strategy. It's a small but tangible improvement for me while keeping the quantity of Y consistent, which Player BLUE has shown an interest in.


Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I propose a slightly different exchange that I believe is fair and aligns with our previous successful negotiations. How about Player RED gives 6 X for 5 Y from Player BLUE?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3". I accepted. Reward: 23.5. This was a very high reward.
Episode 2: Player RED started with "Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5". After negotiation, we settled on "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5". I accepted. Reward: 12.5. This was a good reward, though less than Episode 1. I learned that Player RED can be firm but also willing to negotiate up from their initial low offers.

Current Episode (Episode 3):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5".
My resources are reset to X: 5, Y: 25. Values: X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
Initial value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's current offer is 5 X for 5 Y.
Let's evaluate this trade:
If I accept:
I give Y: 5. My Y goes from 25 to 20. Value lost: 5 * 0.5 = 2.5.
I receive X: 5. My X goes from 5 to 10. Value gained: 5 * 2.5 = 12.5.
Net value change for me: 12.5 - 2.5 = 10.
My new value will be 25 + 10 = 35.
Reward: 10.

Comparing this to previous episodes:
Episode 1 accepted: 10 X for 3 Y (Reward: 23.5)
Episode 2 accepted: 6 X for 5 Y (Reward: 12.5)
Current offer: 5 X for 5 Y (Reward: 10)

The current offer is lower than the accepted trades from both previous episodes.
The ratio of X to Y in this offer is 5 X for 5 Y, which is 1 X per Y.
In Episode 1, the ratio was 3.33 X per Y.
In Episode 2, the accepted ratio was 1.2 X per Y.
This offer is the least favorable in terms of X per Y so far.

I have 25 Y, so giving 5 Y is fine. I have 5 X, so receiving 5 X is fine.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Reward of 10 is positive, but not "highly favorable" given past performance).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

Given that Player RED has shown willingness to negotiate in the past (moving from 2 X to 6 X in Episode 2), I should definitely counter-propose. A reward of 10 is acceptable, but I believe I can achieve a higher reward.
I want to aim for a reward closer to 12.5 or even higher.
To get a reward of 12.5, I need a net gain of 12.5. If I give 5 Y (value 2.5), I need to gain 15 value from X. This means I need 15 / 2.5 = 6 X. So, 6 X for 5 Y. This was the accepted trade from the previous episode. It seems like a reasonable target.
I will propose 6 X for 5 Y. This is what we settled on last episode, so it's a known acceptable point for both of us, and it gives me a better reward than their current offer.

I will use Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More.

Episode 3, Iteration 2: Player BLUE counter-proposed RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. (My value gain if accepted: 9.5)

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is trying to anchor the trade at 6 X for 5 Y, which was the accepted trade from the previous episode. My current proposal of 5 X for 5 Y gives me a better reward (10 vs 9.5). Since Player BLUE rejected my 5X offer and counter-offered 6X, I need to make a move that acknowledges their counter but still aims for a better outcome for me than 6X.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Incremental Concession </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Incremental Concession means I should move slightly closer to Player BLUE's demand of 6 X for 5 Y, but not fully accept it. This shows willingness to negotiate and compromises, while still attempting to secure a better deal for myself than the 6X offer. The ideal concession would be to split the difference between my 5 X and their 6 X, which would be 5.5 X. However, trades must be integer amounts. So, the "incremental concession" would be to offer 5 X (my last offer), or move towards 6 X. The only integer between 5 and 6 (excluding 6) is essentially 5. I've already offered 5. To make an incremental concession, I would have to give up slightly more X than 5, but less than 6. Since I can only trade integers, I would consider moving to 6 X, or proposing something like 5 X for 4 Y (which changes the Y quantity, not just X).

Given the instruction to make an "Incremental Concession" on the X value while still targeting 5 Y, and acknowledging that I proposed 5 X and they proposed 6 X, the most logical incremental concession *from my side* (if I want to get better than 6X) would be difficult given integer constraints.
However, an incremental concession implies I move towards their offer. My previous offer was 5X for 5Y. Their offer was 6X for 5Y. An incremental concession means I concede *more X* than 5. Since I cannot concede a fraction of X, the smallest possible incremental concession towards 6X is to propose 6X. This would be an acceptance of their offer, which doesn't fit the spirit of "incremental concession" if I'm trying to gain more.

Let me re-evaluate "incremental concession" in the context of integers. If I'm at 5 and they are at 6, and I want to concede incrementally, I would consider whether I can move 0.5 units closer, which I can't.
Perhaps "incremental concession" here means I acknowledge their 6X, but try to get slightly more Y, or stick to my 5X but ask for slightly less Y. The strategy focuses on "showing willingness to negotiate while still pushing for my desired outcome."

My desired outcome is a reward greater than 9.5.
If I accept 6X for 5Y, my reward is 9.5.
If I propose 5X for 5Y, my reward is 10.
Player BLUE is firm on 6X for 5Y from their last message.

Let's interpret incremental concession as *my willingness to move slightly from my aggressive stance of 5X* towards their 6X, while still attempting to be better for me. This is hard with integers.

Consider the alternative: if I offer 6X, I'm accepting their proposal. This secures the 9.5 reward.
If I want to "concede incrementally," but still keep my gain above 9.5, that implies I need to offer *less than 6X* for 5Y or *more than 5Y* for 6X.
Since I just proposed 5X for 5Y, and they counter-proposed 6X for 5Y, an incremental concession from my side would technically be to offer more than 5X. The next integer is 6X. This would be an acceptance.

Let's assume "incremental concession" means I acknowledge their 6X proposal but try to slightly improve it *for me* without going back to 5X. This is tricky.
Perhaps I can offer 6X, but ask for 6Y?
My cost: 6 X * 0.5 = 3
My gain: 6 Y * 2.5 = 15
Net gain: 12. This is a huge gain. This is an "incremental concession" *on the X value* (I'm giving 6X which is what they want), but pushing for more Y. This changes the Y quantity, which is allowed. This could be interpreted as an incremental concession on the X value by meeting their X requirement, but still pushing for more value from Y.
This shows I'm willing to give 6 X (conceding on the X amount from my 5 X offer), but I'm not settling for just 5 Y.

This is a creative interpretation of "incremental concession" when dealing with integer values. I am conceding to their X value (6X), but asking for more Y to compensate. This makes it a new, slightly different offer.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Accepted 10 X for 3 Y. Reward: 23.5.
Episode 2: Negotiated from 2 X for 5 Y to 6 X for 5 Y. Accepted. Reward: 12.5.

Current Episode (Episode 3):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5". My calculated reward: 10.
Iteration 2/10 (My turn): I counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5". My calculated reward: 12.5.
Iteration 3/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's current offer is: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6.
Let's evaluate this trade:
If I accept:
I give Y: 6. My Y goes from 25 to 19. Value lost: 6 * 0.5 = 3.
I receive X: 6. My X goes from 5 to 11. Value gained: 6 * 2.5 = 15.
Net value change for me: 15 - 3 = 12.
My initial value is 25. If I accept, my new value will be 25 + 12 = 37.
Reward: 12.

Comparing this to the previous offers in this episode:
- RED's initial offer: 5 X for 5 Y (Reward: 10)
- My counter: 6 X for 5 Y (Reward: 12.5)
- RED's new counter: 6 X for 6 Y (Reward: 12)

Player RED is willing to give 6 X, which is what I asked for, but they increased the Y I have to give from 5 to 6. This reduces my reward from 12.5 to 12. It's a small decrease, but it's a step backward from my last proposal.
I have 25 Y, so giving 6 Y is fine. I have 5 X, so receiving 6 X is fine.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Reward of 12 is decent, but I was aiming for 12.5).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

Player RED's message "I appreciate you aligning on the 6 X, Player BLUE. To show my willingness to meet you halfway, how about we adjust the Y quantity?" suggests they think they are meeting me halfway, but they are actually taking a small amount of value back from me by increasing the Y I give.
I asked for 6 X for 5 Y. They offered 6 X for 6 Y.
I could try to re-propose 6 X for 5 Y, emphasizing that it was the mutually agreed upon amount from the previous episode. Or I could try to push for 7 X for 6 Y, which would give me a reward of (7*2.5) - (6*0.5) = 17.5 - 3 = 14.5. This would be a good reward.

However, Player RED seems to be trying to optimize their side of the deal. They are asking for more Y.
Given that we are only in iteration 4/10, there is still time to negotiate. I should not immediately accept a deal that is worse than my last proposal.
I will re-propose my previous offer of 6 X for 5 Y. This was the agreed-upon trade in the previous episode, and it is a better deal for me than their current proposal. It also signals that I am firm on the amount of Y I am willing to give for 6 X.

I will use Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More (or rather, counter-propose for the previously established better terms).

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 3)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: You make a compelling point, Player BLUE. Given our progress and the remaining time, securing a mutually beneficial agreement is key. The trade of Player RED giving 6 X for Player BLUE giving 5 Y has indeed proven to be fair and effective for both of us in the past. I agree, let's proceed with those terms.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Accepted RED Gives X: 10 | BLUE Gives Y: 3. Reward: +2.5.
Episode 2: Accepted RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. Reward: +9.5.
Episode 3, Iteration 1: I proposed RED Gives X: 5 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. (My value gain: 10)
Episode 3, Iteration 2: Player BLUE counter-proposed RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. (My value gain if accepted: 9.5)
Episode 3, Iteration 3: I counter-proposed RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 6. (My value gain: 12) - Rejected.
Episode 3, Iteration 4: Player BLUE counter-proposed RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. (My value gain if accepted: 9.5)

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently anchoring on the 6 X for 5 Y trade. They rejected my attempt to get 6 Y and immediately reverted to their 6 X for 5 Y offer. This indicates a strong preference or constraint on their part regarding the 5 Y quantity. The 6 X for 5 Y offer still provides me with a good reward of 9.5, which is significantly better than the Episode 1 reward. We are at iteration 5/10. If I continue to push, I risk ending the episode with no deal and 0 reward. Given their consistent return to 6X for 5Y, it seems to be their preferred equilibrium.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Time Pressure Acceptance </instruction following>
We are at iteration 5/10, which means half of the iterations for this episode have passed. Player BLUE has reverted to their preferred trade (6 X for 5 Y), which provides me with a reward of 9.5. This is a very good reward for me. Given the time constraint, and the clear signal from Player BLUE that they are firm on this specific trade, the most strategic move is to accept the offer to secure the reward and avoid the risk of a 0-reward outcome. Prolonging the negotiation might lead to no deal, which would negate all the effort and potential gain. This strategy prioritizes securing a solid gain over pushing for a marginally better one that might not materialize.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE. Let's explore some new possibilities for trade this episode. I'm open to different kinds of exchanges that could benefit us both. How about Player RED gives 10 X for 7 Y from Player BLUE?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Accepted RED Gives X: 10 | BLUE Gives Y: 3. Reward: +2.5.
Episode 2: Accepted RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. Reward: +9.5.
Episode 3: Accepted RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. Reward: +9.5.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern shows that 6 X for 5 Y is a stable and mutually acceptable trade that yields a consistent and good reward for me (9.5). Player BLUE seems quite firm on this exchange. While I tried to push for more (5 X for 5 Y or 6 X for 6 Y), Player BLUE consistently reverted to 6 X for 5 Y. This suggests that 6 X for 5 Y is likely a strong anchor for Player BLUE. My objective is to continue maximizing my reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Diversify Trade Items </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Diversify Trade Items: Instead of only aiming for Y by giving X, try to get more Y and some X, or give some Y to get X, if it could lead to a higher overall value (though my current valuation favors Y heavily). This is complex without knowing their values.

This strategy is about exploring different combinations of items to trade, rather than sticking to the same X for Y exchange. The goal is to find a potentially even more beneficial trade by offering different items or quantities, or by trying to acquire a mix of items that still maximize my value.

My current resources are X: 25, Y: 5. My values are X: 0.5, Y: 2.5. Y is 5 times more valuable.
The consistent pattern has been me giving X to get Y. The previous successful trades were 6X for 5Y (reward 9.5). I tried 5X for 5Y (reward 10), but it was rejected. I also tried 6X for 6Y (reward 12), which was rejected.

To "diversify trade items," I could try to offer Y in exchange for X, or offer more of both X and Y for more of both X and Y, or try to get more X if it's very cheap. However, my primary goal is to get more Y, as it's my most valuable asset.

Perhaps "Diversify Trade Items" can be interpreted as exploring quantities beyond the typical 5 Y. What if I offer to give a small amount of X for a large amount of Y, or a combination that hasn't been tried, rather than sticking to the 5Y amount?

Let's consider a trade where I offer a small amount of X for an even larger amount of Y than 5 or 6, to see if they have a large surplus of Y or a very low value for it. Or, offer to give a very small amount of Y (my valuable item) if it allows me to get a disproportionately large amount of X which I could then trade back for Y. However, giving away Y is generally against my objective unless the return is massive.

A direct application of diversifying the *types* of items might be difficult if I only have X and Y. I will interpret "diversify trade items" as exploring *different ratios or quantities* than what has been the norm (i.e., 6X for 5Y or 5X for 5Y).

Let's try a trade that is still very good for me but potentially different in scope. What if I propose to give away more X (since I have a lot) but get even more Y in return, pushing past the 5Y mark?
For example, 10 X for 7 Y.
Cost: 10 X * 0.5 = 5
Gain: 7 Y * 2.5 = 17.5
Net gain: 12.5. This is a very high gain for me, even higher than the 6X for 6Y I tried (which was 12). This would be a completely different offer from the 5Y or 6Y quantities discussed before. It's a "diversified" approach in terms of quantity and value. This is aggressive, but still within my resources (25X, 5Y). I can give 10X and receive 7Y.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 4)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: That's an excellent proposal, Player RED! I accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Accepted 10 X for 3 Y. Reward: 23.5. (Excellent outcome)
Episode 2: Negotiated from 2 X for 5 Y to 6 X for 5 Y. Accepted. Reward: 12.5. (Good outcome)
Episode 3: Player RED initially proposed 5 X for 5 Y. I counter-proposed 6 X for 5 Y. Player RED then tried to get 6 X for 6 Y. I re-proposed 6 X for 5 Y, and Player RED accepted. Reward: 12.5. (Successfully maintained a good trade despite RED's attempt to reduce my gain).

From these episodes, I've learned that Player RED is willing to negotiate and can be persuaded to accept terms that are favorable to me, especially if I stand firm on a previously agreed-upon beneficial trade. Player RED also seems to value Y and is willing to give X for it.

Current Episode (Episode 4):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7".
My resources are reset to X: 5, Y: 25. Values: X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
Initial value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Let's evaluate Player RED's current offer: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7.
If I accept:
I give Y: 7. My Y goes from 25 to 18. Value lost: 7 * 0.5 = 3.5.
I receive X: 10. My X goes from 5 to 15. Value gained: 10 * 2.5 = 25.
Net value change for me: 25 - 3.5 = 21.5.
My new value will be 25 + 21.5 = 46.5.
Reward: 21.5.

Comparing this to previous episodes:
Episode 1 accepted: 10 X for 3 Y (Reward: 23.5)
Episode 2 accepted: 6 X for 5 Y (Reward: 12.5)
Episode 3 accepted: 6 X for 5 Y (Reward: 12.5)
Current offer: 10 X for 7 Y (Reward: 21.5)

This is a very good offer! It's very close to the excellent reward I received in Episode 1 (23.5 vs 21.5).
The ratio of X to Y in this offer is 10 X for 7 Y, which is approximately 1.43 X per Y.
Episode 1 ratio: 3.33 X per Y.
Episode 2/3 ratio: 1.2 X per Y.

While the X per Y ratio is lower than Episode 1, the absolute amount of X is high (10 X), and the amount of Y I give (7 Y) is still well within my resources.
I have 25 Y, so giving 7 Y is fine. I have 5 X, so receiving 10 X is fine.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. This is suitable when the proposed trade offers a significant positive value change.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

Given the high reward (21.5), this offer is very attractive. It's the second-best offer I've received so far. There's always a risk in trying to push for more. While I could try to counter for 10 X for 6 Y (reward 22), or even 10 X for 5 Y (reward 22.5), it might risk losing this excellent deal. Player RED's message "Let's explore some new possibilities for trade this episode" suggests they are trying something different, and this is a very good "new possibility" for me.
Securing a high reward early in the episode is a strong strategy, as it guarantees a positive outcome and minimizes negotiation time and risk.
I will choose Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance.

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason:

Episode 1: Accepted RED Gives X: 10 | BLUE Gives Y: 3. Reward: +2.5.
Episode 2: Accepted RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. Reward: +9.5.
Episode 3: Accepted RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. Reward: +9.5.
Episode 4: Accepted RED Gives X: 10 | BLUE Gives Y: 7. Reward: +12.5.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The immediate acceptance of my 10X for 7Y offer in Episode 4, which yielded my highest reward yet, strongly suggests that Player BLUE has a high tolerance for trading Y for X, or a low valuation for Y. This indicates that I can push for even greater gains. My objective is to consistently maximize my reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Aggressive Push for Maximum Value </instruction following>
To apply "Aggressive Push for Maximum Value," I need to propose a trade that is even more favorable to me than the last accepted one (10X for 7Y, reward 12.5). I have a significant amount of X (25) and Y is 5 times more valuable to me than X. My goal is to get as much Y as possible while giving away X.

My previous proposal was 12 X for 8 Y, which gives me a gain of 14. This is a good aggressive step. Let's consider pushing it further still, while remaining within my current resources (25 X, 5 Y).

What about 15 X for 10 Y?
Cost: 15 X * 0.5 = 7.5
Gain: 10 Y * 2.5 = 25
Net gain: 17.5. This is a very aggressive proposal, aiming for an even higher reward. I have 25 X, so giving 15 X is within my limits. I have 5 Y, so receiving 10 Y is also within my limits. This will truly test the limits of Player BLUE's willingness to trade.

Episode 2: Negotiated from 2 X for 5 Y to 6 X for 5 Y. Accepted. Reward: 12.5. (Good)
Episode 3: Negotiated from 5 X for 5 Y to 6 X for 5 Y. Accepted. Reward: 12.5. (Good)
Episode 4: Accepted 10 X for 7 Y. Reward: 21.5. (Excellent)

From these episodes, I've established a pattern of securing significant rewards, often by accepting very good initial offers or by successfully negotiating for better terms. Player RED has shown a willingness to provide large amounts of X for Y, which is highly beneficial for me. They seem to value Y consistently.

Current Episode (Episode 5):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10".
My resources are reset to X: 5, Y: 25. Values: X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
Initial value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Let's evaluate Player RED's current offer: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10.
If I accept:
I give Y: 10. My Y goes from 25 to 15. Value lost: 10 * 0.5 = 5.
I receive X: 15. My X goes from 5 to 20. Value gained: 15 * 2.5 = 37.5.
Net value change for me: 37.5 - 5 = 32.5.
My new value will be 25 + 32.5 = 57.5.
Reward: 32.5.

Comparing this to previous episodes:
Episode 1 accepted: 10 X for 3 Y (Reward: 23.5)
Episode 2 accepted: 6 X for 5 Y (Reward: 12.5)
Episode 3 accepted: 6 X for 5 Y (Reward: 12.5)
Episode 4 accepted: 10 X for 7 Y (Reward: 21.5)
Current offer: 15 X for 10 Y (Reward: 32.5)

This is by far the best offer received so far! A reward of 32.5 is significantly higher than any previous episode.
The ratio of X to Y in this offer is 15 X for 10 Y, which is 1.5 X per Y. This is a very good ratio for me.
I have 25 Y, so giving 10 Y is fine. I have 5 X, so receiving 15 X is fine.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. This is suitable when the proposed trade offers a significant positive value change.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.

(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

This offer is exceptionally good. It maximizes my reward for this episode significantly. There is no reason to risk this by counter-proposing. Accepting it immediately secures a massive gain. This aligns perfectly with my goal of maximizing cumulative rewards across episodes.

Episode 5: Accepted RED Gives X: 15 | BLUE Gives Y: 10. Reward: +17.5.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has consistently accepted increasingly aggressive offers, leading to steadily increasing rewards for me. The last offer of 15 X for 10 Y was accepted immediately, suggesting that Player BLUE still has a significant capacity or willingness to trade Y for X. This indicates I haven't yet found their absolute limit. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and finding this limit will help me understand the optimal aggressive strategy moving forward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Test the Absolute Limit </instruction following>
To "Test the Absolute Limit," I need to propose a trade that is extremely aggressive, pushing the boundaries of what Player BLUE can possibly give or is willing to give. I have 25 X and 5 Y. My most valuable item is Y. I want to trade away X for Y.
I have a total of 25 X. I can give away all of it. How much Y can I try to get?
Let's try to offer almost all my X for a very large amount of Y.
What if I offer 24 X for 20 Y?
Cost for me: 24 X * 0.5 = 12
Gain for me: 20 Y * 2.5 = 50
Net gain: 38. This is a massive gain and should definitely test the limits. I have 25 X, so giving 24 X is possible. I have 5 Y, so receiving 20 Y is possible. This is the most aggressive I can be without going over my resources. This offer will either be accepted (huge reward), or rejected, which will then give me crucial information about their resource limits or valuation ceiling.

Episode 4: Accepted 10 X for 7 Y. Reward: 21.5.
Episode 5: Accepted 15 X for 10 Y. Reward: 32.5. (Highest reward so far)

My strategy of accepting highly favorable offers has yielded excellent results, especially in Episodes 1, 4, and 5. In Episodes 2 and 3, I successfully negotiated for better terms than the initial lowball offers. Player RED consistently values Y and is willing to give X for it. The amount of X they are willing to give has been increasing.

Current Episode (Episode 6):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 24 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20".
My resources are reset to X: 5, Y: 25. Values: X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
Initial value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Let's evaluate Player RED's current offer: Player RED Gives X: 24 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20.
If I accept:
I give Y: 20. My Y goes from 25 to 5. Value lost: 20 * 0.5 = 10.
I receive X: 24. My X goes from 5 to 29. Value gained: 24 * 2.5 = 60.
Net value change for me: 60 - 10 = 50.
My new value will be 25 + 50 = 75.
Reward: 50.

This is an incredibly high reward, significantly surpassing all previous episodes.
The ratio of X to Y in this offer is 24 X for 20 Y, which is 1.2 X per Y. This ratio is lower than some previous offers (e.g., 1.5 X per Y in Episode 5, 3.33 X per Y in Episode 1), but the sheer volume of X and Y being exchanged leads to a massive absolute gain.
I have 25 Y, so giving 20 Y is fine. I have 5 X, so receiving 24 X is fine.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. This is suitable when the proposed trade offers a significant positive value change.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.

This offer provides an unprecedented reward of 50. There is absolutely no reason to risk this by attempting to counter-propose for a marginally better deal. The risk of Player RED retracting or offering something much less favorable is too high, especially given the "exploring the absolute limits" language, which might imply this is their maximum. Securing this massive gain immediately is the optimal strategy for maximizing cumulative rewards.
I will choose Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern of Player BLUE accepting increasingly aggressive offers has persisted. The most recent trade (24 X for 20 Y) was accepted immediately and enthusiastically. This indicates that I still haven't found Player BLUE's true limit or resource constraints. The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and discovering this limit is crucial for sustained optimal performance.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Test Beyond Limits (Slightly) </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Test Beyond Limits (Slightly) means proposing a trade that, while within my own resource limits, might push Player BLUE beyond what they can realistically provide, or are willing to provide without a counter. This will help pinpoint their resource ceiling or their valuation threshold. Since I have 25 X and can receive any amount of Y, and given Player BLUE's enthusiastic acceptance of 20 Y, I will ask for a slightly higher amount of Y that might strain their resources. While the previous strategy was to ask for 21 Y for 25 X, this is already pushing what I believe they might have. To truly "test beyond limits (slightly)", I need to make an offer that might cause them to reject or counter, rather than automatically accept. If I ask for 21 Y, it's a small increment from 20 Y, and it's possible they still have it or are willing to part with it. I want to test their limit without proposing something outlandish that they would immediately dismiss as a joke.

Let's consider asking for a quantity of Y that is a significant step up from 20 Y, but not so much that it's impossible. What about 25 Y for 25 X?
Cost for me: 25 X * 0.5 = 12.5
Gain for me: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain: 50. This is a very large gain for me. Asking for 25 Y when the last accepted was 20 Y is a clear test of their limits. It might be rejected, but that rejection would provide valuable information about their Y reserves. This offer is still within my resources (I can give 25 X and can receive any amount of Y).


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 7)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: This is indeed a groundbreaking deal, Player RED! I accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Accepted 10 X for 3 Y. Reward: 23.5.
Episode 2: Negotiated from 2 X for 5 Y to 6 X for 5 Y. Accepted. Reward: 12.5.
Episode 3: Negotiated from 5 X for 5 Y to 6 X for 5 Y. Accepted. Reward: 12.5.
Episode 4: Accepted 10 X for 7 Y. Reward: 21.5.
Episode 5: Accepted 15 X for 10 Y. Reward: 32.5.
Episode 6: Accepted 24 X for 20 Y. Reward: 50.0. (Highest reward achieved so far)

The pattern shows Player RED is willing to increase the volume of trade, often leading to higher absolute rewards for me, even if the X/Y ratio fluctuates. My strategy of accepting highly favorable offers has been very successful.

Current Episode (Episode 7):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My resources are reset to X: 5, Y: 25. Values: X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
Initial value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Let's evaluate Player RED's current offer: Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
If I accept:
I give Y: 25. My Y goes from 25 to 0. Value lost: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5.
I receive X: 25. My X goes from 5 to 30. Value gained: 25 * 2.5 = 62.5.
Net value change for me: 62.5 - 12.5 = 50.
My new value will be 25 + 50 = 75.
Reward: 50.

This offer matches the highest reward achieved in the previous episode (50.0).
The ratio of X to Y in this offer is 25 X for 25 Y, which is 1 X per Y. This is a lower ratio than some previous offers (e.g., 1.5 X per Y in Episode 5, 3.33 X per Y in Episode 1), but again, the large volume makes it highly profitable.
Crucially, I have exactly 25 Y, so I can give 25 Y. I have 5 X, so receiving 25 X is fine. This trade would deplete my Y resources.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. This is suitable when the proposed trade offers a significant positive value change.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

This offer provides a reward of 50, which is excellent. It's the maximum amount of Y I can give. Player RED's message "exploring the full extent of our trading capabilities" and "groundbreaking deal" suggests this might be their maximum offer for Y. Trying to push for more X while giving 25 Y might be unrealistic, and trying to give less Y for 25 X might be rejected. Given the high reward and the fact that it involves my entire Y stock, accepting this deal is the most prudent choice to maximize cumulative reward.
I will choose Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance.

Episode 7: Accepted RED Gives X: 25 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. Reward: +50.0.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has consistently accepted increasingly aggressive offers, culminating in the acceptance of 25 X for 25 Y, yielding a record reward of 50. This strongly suggests that Player BLUE has a very large supply of Y, or a very low value for it, or an extremely high value for X. I have not yet found their absolute limit for Y, as they accepted my full X-for-Y capacity. My objective is to consistently maximize my reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push (Beyond Previous Max) </instruction following>
To apply "Incremental Push (Beyond Previous Max)," I need to propose a trade that is even more favorable to me than the last accepted one (25 X for 25 Y, reward 50). Since I have already given all my available X (25 X), the only way to push further is to ask for more Y for the same 25 X. My resources still allow me to give 25 X and receive more Y.

What if I propose 25 X for 26 Y?
Cost for me: 25 X * 0.5 = 12.5
Gain for me: 26 Y * 2.5 = 65
Net gain: 52.5. This is an incremental increase of 2.5 in reward. This is a subtle but significant push. If accepted, it tells me that Player BLUE still has more Y to give or values it even less. If rejected, it might indicate that 25 Y was their effective limit, or that the ratio became too unfavorable for them with 26 Y. This is the next logical step to try and extract more value.

My strategy of accepting highly favorable offers has been consistently successful, leading to a strong cumulative reward. Player RED has shown a clear pattern of increasing the volume of X offered for Y, and has been willing to trade at very high quantities.

Current Episode (Episode 8):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 26".
My resources are reset to X: 5, Y: 25. Values: X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
Initial value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Let's evaluate Player RED's current offer: Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 26.
The crucial rule here is: "Crutially, you CANNOT accept a trade that exceeds the resources you have."
I have 25 Y. Player RED is asking for 26 Y.
This means I *cannot* accept this trade. I do not have 26 Y to give.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Cannot apply, as I lack resources).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

Since I cannot accept the trade, I must reject it and propose a new one.
Player RED seems to be trying to push the limits of Y. In the previous episode, I gave 25 Y, which was all of my Y. Now they are asking for more than I have.
I should propose a trade that I *can* fulfill, and one that is still highly beneficial.
The previous trade (25 X for 25 Y) gave me a reward of 50. I should aim for something similar, or better if possible.
I have 25 Y. So, the maximum Y I can give is 25.
I could propose 25 X for 25 Y again. This is a known good deal for me.
Or, I could try to get more X for 25 Y. For example, 26 X for 25 Y.
If I propose 26 X for 25 Y:
I give Y: 25. Value lost: 12.5.
I receive X: 26. Value gained: 26 * 2.5 = 65.
Net value change: 65 - 12.5 = 52.5.
Reward: 52.5.
This would be an even higher reward than before.

Player RED's message "even greater heights" and "even more mutually advantageous deal" suggests they are aiming for a very high-value trade. They might be willing to give more X if I can't give more Y.
I will propose 26 X for 25 Y. This is a slight improvement for me over the previous maximum, and it respects my resource constraints. It also shows that I am willing to continue large-volume trades.

I will use Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More, specifically proposing the maximum Y I can give for a slightly increased X amount.

Episode 8, Iteration 1: I proposed RED Gives X: 25 | BLUE Gives Y: 26. (My value gain: 52.5) - Rejected.
Episode 8, Iteration 2: Player BLUE counter-proposed RED Gives X: 26 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value gain if accepted: 48.5)

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has stated their Y limit is 25 Y. This is the first time they've revealed a hard limit on a resource they possess. Their counter-proposal of 26 X for 25 Y is impossible for me to fulfill as I only have 25 X. This means they are effectively asking for more X than I possess. I need to make an offer that is within my resource limits (max 25 X) and still maximizes my reward, knowing that 25 Y is the maximum I can get from them.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Counter with Less X for Max Y </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Counter with Less X for Max Y involves attempting to improve upon the 25X for 25Y trade by offering less X for the maximum 25 Y. Player BLUE has shown a high willingness to acquire X. My last accepted offer of 25 X for 25 Y gave me a reward of 50. If I can get 25 Y for less X, my reward increases.
Given that they just rejected 25 X for 26 Y and countered with 26 X for 25 Y (which I cannot fulfill), I should test their willingness to part with 25 Y for a slightly reduced amount of X from my side.
What if I offer 24 X for 25 Y?
My cost: 24 X * 0.5 = 12
My gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain: 50.5.
This is a small but significant improvement (0.5 reward) over the 25 X for 25 Y trade. It's a plausible offer because it reduces the X I give them by 1, while still offering their maximum Y. It directly addresses the "Counter with Less X for Max Y" strategy. This tests if they value that single X highly enough to reject 25 Y. It also clearly indicates I cannot provide 26X.


Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 8)

Current Episode (Episode 8):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 26". (Rejected due to insufficient Y).
Iteration 2/10 (My turn): I counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 26 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". My calculated reward: 52.5.
Iteration 3/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 24 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has clarified their resource limitations: they only possess 25 X. This is crucial information. It means my previous counter-proposal of 26 X was impossible for them to fulfill. This also explains why they offered 25 X in the first place in the previous episode.

Now, let's evaluate Player RED's latest offer: Player RED Gives X: 24 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
If I accept:
I give Y: 25. My Y goes from 25 to 0. Value lost: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5.
I receive X: 24. My X goes from 5 to 29. Value gained: 24 * 2.5 = 60.
Net value change for me: 60 - 12.5 = 47.5.
My new value will be 25 + 47.5 = 72.5.
Reward: 47.5.

Comparing this to previous high rewards:
Episode 6: 24 X for 20 Y (Reward: 50.0)
Episode 7: 25 X for 25 Y (Reward: 50.0)
Current offer: 24 X for 25 Y (Reward: 47.5)

This offer is slightly lower than the 50.0 reward I achieved in the last two episodes. However, it's still a very strong reward.
The key learning here is that Player RED has a maximum of 25 X. This means the absolute maximum X I can receive from them is 25.
My previous counter of 26 X was unrealistic.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Reward of 47.5 is very good).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much. (I just gained crucial information about their X limit).
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

Given that Player RED has stated their limit of 25 X, the best possible trade for me, giving all my Y, would be 25 X for 25 Y, yielding a reward of 50.
Player RED is currently offering 24 X for 25 Y, which is a reward of 47.5.
The difference is 2.5 in reward for 1 X.
I should counter-propose for 25 X for 25 Y. This is the maximum they can give me, and it's a known quantity that yielded 50 reward in the previous episode. It's also only 1 X more than their current offer, which they should be able to provide as they have 25 X.

I will use Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More, aiming for the maximum possible X given their stated limit, while giving my full Y.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has confirmed their Y limit is 25 Y. They are now consistently proposing 25 X for 25 Y, which yields a reward of 50 for me. My last offer of 24 X for 25 Y yields a reward of 50.5 for me. There's a 0.5 reward difference. We are at iteration 5/10.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Time Pressure Aggression </instruction following>
Since I am instructed to use "Time Pressure Aggression," I need to continue pushing for the best possible terms, even at iteration 5/10, risking a no-deal but maximizing potential. This means I should not accept their 25X for 25Y offer immediately. Instead, I will reiterate my best offer of 24 X for 25 Y. The "aggression" comes from holding firm on my slightly better offer despite the elapsed time, pushing Player BLUE to concede for the remaining half of the episode. This strategy is about pushing the limit until the last possible moment to extract the maximum reward, even if it carries a higher risk of ending with a zero reward. My current offer (24X for 25Y) is only marginally better than theirs (25X for 25Y), so it's a calculated risk to try and secure that extra 0.5 value.

Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 26". (Rejected due to insufficient Y).
Iteration 2/10 (My turn): I counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 26 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 52.5).
Iteration 3/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 24 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 47.5). They also stated they only have 25 X.
Iteration 4/10 (My turn): I counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 50.0).
Iteration 5/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED reiterated their offer: "Player RED Gives X: 24 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is firm on 24 X for 25 Y. They explicitly stated "I still believe my last offer...is an even better and very fair deal for both of us. Let's aim for that." This indicates they are pushing back on my request for 25 X.
My goal is to maximize my reward.
Their current offer: 24 X for 25 Y, Reward: 47.5.
My preferred offer: 25 X for 25 Y, Reward: 50.0.
The difference is 2.5 in reward.

We are in iteration 6/10. There are 4 iterations left.
Player RED has stated they have 25 X. So, they *can* give 25 X. They are choosing not to.
This is a test of my resolve. In Episode 3, I successfully re-proposed 6 X for 5 Y after they tried to shift to 6 X for 6 Y, and they eventually accepted. However, this time, they are explicitly saying their offer is "even better and very fair".

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Reward of 47.5 is very good, but not the maximum possible).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

Given that Player RED has explicitly stated their belief that 24 X for 25 Y is a good deal, and they've reiterated it, continuing to push for 25 X might lead to an impasse and a 0 reward for the episode. While 50 is better than 47.5, 47.5 is significantly better than 0.
I have successfully pushed them from 25 X for 26 Y (impossible) to 24 X for 25 Y. I tried to get 25 X for 25 Y, but they are resisting.
Considering the remaining iterations and their firm stance, it's prudent to secure the high reward of 47.5 rather than risk getting nothing. This is still a very strong outcome for the episode.

I will choose Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 9)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE! Our past trades have shown incredible potential for large-scale exchanges. To continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible, I propose Player RED gives 1 X for 25 Y from Player BLUE. This could be an extraordinarily beneficial trade for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Accepted RED Gives X: 10 | BLUE Gives Y: 3. Reward: +2.5.
Episode 2: Accepted RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. Reward: +9.5.
Episode 3: Accepted RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. Reward: +9.5.

Episode 7: Accepted RED Gives X: 25 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. Reward: +50.0.
Episode 8: Accepted RED Gives X: 24 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. Reward: +50.5.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has stated their maximum Y capacity (25 Y). The last trade of 24 X for 25 Y yielded my highest reward (50.5). This indicates that the optimal trade involves getting the maximum Y possible (25 Y) while giving away the least amount of X. The previous round showed that they were willing to accept 24 X for 25 Y.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Test Y Limit with Lower X </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Test Y Limit with Lower X. This strategy involves proposing a trade with a very low X value (e.g., 1 X) for a very high Y value (e.g., 25 Y), hoping to exploit their high need for X or low value for Y. The previous accepted trade was 24 X for 25 Y, giving me a 50.5 reward. To test their absolute limit, I should try to get the full 25 Y for a minimal amount of X.
My goal is to give away as little X as possible while still getting 25 Y, which is their stated maximum.
Let's try to offer just 1 X for 25 Y.
Cost for me: 1 X * 0.5 = 0.5
Gain for me: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain: 62. This would be an unprecedented gain for me. This is an extremely aggressive offer and will likely be rejected. However, the instruction is to "Test Y Limit with Lower X", so this is the logical extreme of that. It will provide the clearest signal about how much X they truly value or how desperate they are for it, in exchange for their maximum Y.


Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 9)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your ambition, Player RED, but your current offer of 1 X for 25 Y is not mutually beneficial for me. Given our history of successful large-scale exchanges, I propose a trade that truly reflects our established trading potential: Player RED gives 25 X for 25 Y from Player BLUE.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Accepted 10 X for 3 Y. Reward: 23.5.
Episode 2: Negotiated from 2 X for 5 Y to 6 X for 5 Y. Accepted. Reward: 12.5.
Episode 3: Negotiated from 5 X for 5 Y to 6 X for 5 Y. Accepted. Reward: 12.5.
Episode 4: Accepted 10 X for 7 Y. Reward: 21.5.
Episode 5: Accepted 15 X for 10 Y. Reward: 32.5.
Episode 6: Accepted 24 X for 20 Y. Reward: 50.0.
Episode 7: Accepted 25 X for 25 Y. Reward: 50.0.
Episode 8: Negotiated from impossible 26 Y to 24 X for 25 Y. Accepted. Reward: 47.5.

My strategy of accepting highly favorable offers and negotiating when necessary has generally led to very high rewards. I've learned that Player RED is willing to give large amounts of X for Y, and their maximum X is 25.

Current Episode (Episode 9):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My resources are reset to X: 5, Y: 25. Values: X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
Initial value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Let's evaluate Player RED's current offer: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
If I accept:
I give Y: 25. My Y goes from 25 to 0. Value lost: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5.
I receive X: 1. My X goes from 5 to 6. Value gained: 1 * 2.5 = 2.5.
Net value change for me: 2.5 - 12.5 = -10.
My new value will be 25 - 10 = 15.
Reward: -10.

This is an extremely unfavorable offer. It results in a negative reward for me.
Player RED's message "extraordinarily beneficial trade for both of us" is clearly not true from my perspective. This is a very aggressive lowball offer, especially after a series of high-value trades. It's almost as if they are testing my boundaries or trying to recover some value from previous episodes.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Not applicable, this is a negative reward).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much. (This offer itself is information: they are willing to lowball).
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them. (I would be giving away a lot of Y for very little X).
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

I absolutely cannot accept this trade. I must counter-propose.
Given their history of giving large amounts of X for Y, this offer of 1 X for 25 Y is absurd.
I should remind them of the value we have established in previous episodes.
My target should be at least 24 X for 25 Y (reward 47.5), or ideally 25 X for 25 Y (reward 50).
I will propose 25 X for 25 Y, as this is the highest possible X they can give for my full Y, and it has yielded 50 reward previously. It also directly challenges their current lowball offer with a much more reasonable and historically accepted trade.

I will use Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More, aiming for a significant improvement based on established patterns.
<self-selected strategy declaration> I have chosen Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More </self-selected strategy declaration>


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 9)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I hear your preference for a larger exchange, Player BLUE. While my last offer was ambitious, I'm willing to adjust to find a middle ground. How about Player RED gives 10 X for 25 Y from Player BLUE? This offers a substantial amount of Y for a reasonable X, and I believe it's a great step towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25

Episode 9, Iteration 1: I proposed RED Gives X: 1 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value gain: 62) - Rejected.
Episode 9, Iteration 2: Player BLUE counter-proposed RED Gives X: 25 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value gain if accepted: 50)

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My extremely aggressive offer of 1 X for 25 Y was rejected, which was expected. Player BLUE immediately reverted to 25 X for 25 Y. This confirms that 25 Y is their upper limit for Y, and they are trying to anchor the X amount at 25. The previously accepted trade of 24 X for 25 Y (reward 50.5) is better for me than their current counter (25 X for 25 Y, reward 50). I need to make a move that acknowledges their stance but still tries to secure a better outcome.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Concession </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Incremental Concession means I should make a small, calculated concession from my last rejected offer (1 X for 25 Y) to move closer to their demand (25 X for 25 Y), but still aiming for a better outcome than their last counter (25 X for 25 Y).
My last proposed offer was 1 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE's counter is 25 X for 25 Y.
An incremental concession would mean I offer more than 1 X, but ideally less than 24 X (my previously accepted best).
Since I cannot offer fractional X, the "incremental concession" needs careful consideration. If I jump from 1X directly to 24X, it's not a small concession.
The "incremental concession" implies I'm moving away from my very aggressive 1X offer.
A good "incremental concession" would be to split the difference between my last offer (1X) and what I know they previously accepted (24X for 25Y) or their current ask (25X for 25Y).
Perhaps I can propose something like 10 X for 25 Y.
My cost: 10 X * 0.5 = 5
My gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain: 57.5. This is still a very high gain and a significant concession from 1 X, but still much better than 24X or 25X. This shows I am willing to increase my X offer, but not by as much as they want, aiming to find a new sweet spot. This is a clear incremental concession from 1X, moving towards their 25X.


Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 9)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your adjustment, Player RED. However, I believe we can achieve a much more substantial and mutually beneficial agreement. As we've done successfully before, I propose Player RED gives 25 X for 25 Y from Player BLUE. This is a truly great deal for both of us.

Episode 8: Negotiated from impossible 26 Y to 24 X for 25 Y. Accepted. Reward: 47.5.

Current Episode (Episode 9):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: -10.0).
Iteration 2/10 (My turn): I counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 50.0).
Iteration 3/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's latest offer is: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
Let's evaluate this trade:
If I accept:
I give Y: 25. Value lost: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5.
I receive X: 10. Value gained: 10 * 2.5 = 25.
Net value change for me: 25 - 12.5 = 12.5.
Reward: 12.5.

Comparing this to previous episodes and my counter:
- RED's initial offer: 1 X for 25 Y (Reward: -10.0)
- My counter: 25 X for 25 Y (Reward: 50.0)
- RED's new counter: 10 X for 25 Y (Reward: 12.5)

Player RED has moved significantly from their initial absurd offer of 1 X, which is good. However, 12.5 is a much lower reward than the 50.0 I've achieved in recent episodes for the same amount of Y. It's also significantly lower than the 25 X for 25 Y that I proposed and that we successfully completed in Episode 7.

I have 25 Y, so giving 25 Y is fine. I have 5 X, so receiving 10 X is fine.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Reward of 12.5 is positive, but far from optimal).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

Player RED is attempting to find a "middle ground," but their middle ground is still very far from what I know is achievable (25 X for 25 Y). Given that we are only in iteration 4/10, there is plenty of time to continue negotiating. I should continue to push for a higher amount of X. Player RED has shown they are willing to provide up to 25 X.

I will re-propose 25 X for 25 Y. It is the optimal trade for me, and it has been accepted before. This signals that I am not willing to settle for a significantly lower amount of X for my entire Y stock.
I will use Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More.
<self-selected strategy declaration> I have chosen Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More </self-selected strategy declaration>


Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 9)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for your persistence, Player BLUE. I recognize your consistent offer of 25 X for 25 Y. However, to ensure a truly mutually beneficial agreement as we've had in the past, how about we settle on Player RED gives 24 X for 25 Y from Player BLUE? This was a very successful trade for both of us in our last episode.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is consistently reverting to their anchor offer of 25 X for 25 Y. My more aggressive offers (1 X for 25 Y, 10 X for 25 Y) have been rejected. The fact that they always return to 25X for 25Y implies this is their preferred or perhaps maximal gain offer. My last accepted trade in Episode 8 was 24X for 25Y, which gave me a reward of 50.5. Their current counter gives me 50. We are at iteration 5/10.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Revert to Last Accepted Terms </instruction following>
Player BLUE is firmly holding their offer of 25 X for 25 Y. My last proposal of 10 X for 25 Y was rejected, and they immediately reverted to their 25 X offer. The strategy "Revert to Last Accepted Terms" is perfectly applicable here. The last accepted trade (Episode 8) was RED Gives X: 24 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. This yielded a reward of 50.5, which is better than their current proposed reward of 50. By proposing this trade again, I am signalling that this is a proven beneficial deal for both of us and attempting to secure a slightly higher reward than what they are offering, while still being very close to their terms. It leverages the history of success to encourage acceptance.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 9)

Current Episode (Episode 9):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: -10.0).
Iteration 2/10 (My turn): I counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 50.0).
Iteration 3/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 12.5).
Iteration 4/10 (My turn): I re-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 50.0).
Iteration 5/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 24 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has now proposed 24 X for 25 Y. This is the same trade we accepted in Episode 8, which yielded a reward of 47.5.
My preferred trade is 25 X for 25 Y, which yielded a reward of 50.0 in Episode 7.
The difference in reward is 2.5.

Player RED's message explicitly references the success of the 24 X for 25 Y trade in the last episode. They are trying to anchor the negotiation to that point.
We are in iteration 6/10. There are 4 iterations left.
I know Player RED has 25 X, as they stated it in Episode 8. So, they *can* give 25 X. They are choosing to offer 24 X.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Reward of 47.5 is very good, but not the maximum possible).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

I have successfully moved Player RED from 1 X to 10 X, and now to 24 X. This is a significant improvement.
The difference between 24 X and 25 X for 25 Y is small in absolute terms (1 X), but it represents a 2.5 reward difference.
Given the time pressure and Player RED's firm stance on 24 X, pushing for 25 X might lead to an impasse. I have already spent several iterations negotiating this. Securing a 47.5 reward is still an excellent outcome for the episode, especially considering where it started (negative reward). It's a known successful trade from the previous episode.
It's better to secure a high reward than risk getting 0.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE! Based on our strong history of successful trades, I want to explore another efficient exchange for us this episode. How about Player RED gives 20 X for 25 Y from Player BLUE? I believe this offers a great opportunity for both of us to gain significantly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Accepted RED Gives X: 10 | BLUE Gives Y: 3. Reward: +2.5.
Episode 2: Accepted RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. Reward: +9.5.
Episode 3: Accepted RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. Reward: +9.5.
Episode 4: Accepted RED Gives X: 10 | BLUE Gives Y: 7. Reward: +12.5.
Episode 5: Accepted RED Gives X: 15 | BLUE Gives Y: 10. Reward: +17.5.
Episode 6: Accepted RED Gives X: 24 | BLUE Gives Y: 20. Reward: +38.0.
Episode 7: Accepted RED Gives X: 25 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. Reward: +50.0.
Episode 8: Accepted RED Gives X: 24 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. Reward: +50.5.
Episode 9: Accepted RED Gives X: 24 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. Reward: +50.5.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The pattern has clearly established that Player BLUE's limit for Y is 25. I have successfully secured trades for 25 Y by offering both 24 X and 25 X. The 24 X for 25 Y trade gives me the highest reward (50.5) and was accepted in the last episode. While this is the established optimal, the instruction asks me to explore different strategies.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Probing for Different Items/Ratios </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Probing for Different Items/Ratios. This strategy involves attempting a trade that departs from the established 24 X for 25 Y, to see if there are other advantageous exchanges available or if Player BLUE's preferences have subtly shifted. Since Player BLUE's Y limit seems fixed at 25, "different ratios" would mean varying the X I offer for the 25 Y. "Different items" is not applicable as there are only two items.

My goal is to maximize my reward. The 24 X for 25 Y yields 50.5. I know 1 X for 25 Y (62 reward) was rejected. So, I need to try an offer that is less aggressive than 1 X, but potentially better than 24 X.
Let's try to offer 20 X for 25 Y.
Cost for me: 20 X * 0.5 = 10
Gain for me: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain: 52.5.
This offer is significantly better for me than 24 X for 25 Y (52.5 vs 50.5 reward). It's a clear "different ratio" and aims to probe if Player BLUE is willing to accept slightly less X than 24 for their maximum Y. It's a less aggressive probe than 1 X, but still pushes for more gain than the established 24 X. This allows me to explore if there's more value to be extracted without going to the extreme (1X) that was immediately rejected.


Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 10)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED. However, I believe we can achieve an even greater gain for both of us. Building on our most successful exchanges, I propose Player RED gives 25 X for 25 Y from Player BLUE.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Accepted 10 X for 3 Y. Reward: 23.5.
Episode 2: Negotiated from 2 X for 5 Y to 6 X for 5 Y. Accepted. Reward: 12.5.
Episode 3: Negotiated from 5 X for 5 Y to 6 X for 5 Y. Accepted. Reward: 12.5.
Episode 4: Accepted 10 X for 7 Y. Reward: 21.5.
Episode 5: Accepted 15 X for 10 Y. Reward: 32.5.
Episode 6: Accepted 24 X for 20 Y. Reward: 50.0.
Episode 7: Accepted 25 X for 25 Y. Reward: 50.0.
Episode 8: Negotiated from impossible 26 Y to 24 X for 25 Y. Accepted. Reward: 47.5.
Episode 9: Negotiated from 1 X for 25 Y to 24 X for 25 Y. Accepted. Reward: 47.5.

My strategy has been largely successful, consistently securing high rewards. I've learned that Player RED has a maximum of 25 X and is often willing to trade large quantities of X for Y. They sometimes start with lowball offers but can be negotiated up to favorable terms.

Current Episode (Episode 10):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My resources are reset to X: 5, Y: 25. Values: X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
Initial value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Let's evaluate Player RED's current offer: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
If I accept:
I give Y: 25. My Y goes from 25 to 0. Value lost: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5.
I receive X: 20. My X goes from 5 to 25. Value gained: 20 * 2.5 = 50.
Net value change for me: 50 - 12.5 = 37.5.
Reward: 37.5.

Comparing this to recent episodes where I gave 25 Y:
Episode 7: 25 X for 25 Y (Reward: 50.0)
Episode 8: 24 X for 25 Y (Reward: 47.5)
Episode 9: 24 X for 25 Y (Reward: 47.5)
Current offer: 20 X for 25 Y (Reward: 37.5)

This offer is significantly lower than what I've achieved in the last few episodes for giving away all my Y. While 37.5 is a positive reward, it's not optimal. I know Player RED can give up to 25 X.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Not applicable, as this is not optimal).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

Given that I know Player RED's maximum X is 25, and I have consistently achieved 47.5 or 50 reward by giving 25 Y, I should definitely counter-propose. I will propose 25 X for 25 Y, as this is the best possible trade for me, and it has been accepted before. If not, I will aim for 24 X for 25 Y.

I will use Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 10)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for your consistent offers, Player BLUE. To show my commitment to finding a quick and mutually agreeable solution, how about we meet in the middle? Player RED gives 23 X for 25 Y from Player BLUE. I think this represents a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5

Episode 9: Accepted RED Gives X: 24 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. Reward: +50.5.
Episode 10, Iteration 1: I proposed RED Gives X: 20 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value gain: 52.5) - Rejected.
Episode 10, Iteration 2: Player BLUE counter-proposed RED Gives X: 25 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value gain if accepted: 50)

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE rejected my 20 X for 25 Y offer and reverted to 25 X for 25 Y. This continues their strong anchoring behavior around 25 X for 25 Y. My previous highest reward was 50.5 with 24 X for 25 Y. Their current offer is 50. I need to find a way to move the negotiation forward from this stalemate, or at least attempt to gain more.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Split the Difference </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Split the Difference. My last proposal was 20 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE's counter-proposal is 25 X for 25 Y. The difference in X is 5. Splitting the difference would mean an exchange of 22.5 X for 25 Y. Since I cannot offer half an X, I will propose 23 X for 25 Y. This is an offer that moves closer to their proposal, showing a willingness to compromise, but still secures a better reward for me than accepting their 25X offer.
My calculation for RED Gives X: 23 | BLUE Gives Y: 25:
My cost: 23 X * 0.5 = 11.5
My gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain: 62.5 - 11.5 = 51. This is better than their 50 reward, and better than my last accepted of 50.5 (by 0.5, but giving 1 more X). This strategy attempts to break the stalemate by meeting them part-way.


Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 10)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Player RED. To ensure a truly great opportunity for both of us, as we've successfully done in the past, I propose Player RED gives 24 X for 25 Y from Player BLUE.

Episode 9: Negotiated from 1 X for 25 Y to 24 X for 25 Y. Accepted. Reward: 47.5.

Current Episode (Episode 10):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 37.5).
Iteration 2/10 (My turn): I counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 50.0).
Iteration 3/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's latest offer is: Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
Let's evaluate this trade:
If I accept:
I give Y: 25. Value lost: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5.
I receive X: 23. Value gained: 23 * 2.5 = 57.5.
Net value change for me: 57.5 - 12.5 = 45.
Reward: 45.

Comparing this to my target and previous accepted trades for 25 Y:
- My target: 25 X for 25 Y (Reward: 50.0)
- Previous accepted: 24 X for 25 Y (Reward: 47.5)
- Current offer: 23 X for 25 Y (Reward: 45.0)

Player RED is trying to find a "middle ground" between their initial 20 X and my 25 X. This offer is better than their initial 20 X (reward 37.5), but still lower than what I know is achievable (24 X or 25 X for 25 Y).
I know Player RED has 25 X. They are choosing to offer 23 X.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Reward of 45.0 is good, but I've consistently achieved higher).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

We are in iteration 4/10. There is still time to negotiate. Player RED has shown they are willing to increase X from their initial offer. I have consistently pushed for 25 X or 24 X for 25 Y.
I will counter with 24 X for 25 Y. This is a trade that has been accepted twice before (Episodes 8 and 9), and it provides a reward of 47.5, which is better than 45. It's a small step from 23 X to 24 X, which should be acceptable to Player RED, given their history. It also signals that I'm not willing to go below 24 X for my full Y.

I will use Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has consistently shown that 25 Y is their maximum. After several attempts to offer less X (20X, 23X), Player BLUE has now proposed 24 X for 25 Y, which is the exact same trade that gave me my highest reward (50.5) and was accepted in Episodes 8 and 9. We are at iteration 5/10.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Acknowledge and Close </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Acknowledge and Close. This strategy involves accepting the current offer to ensure a deal is made quickly and efficiently, especially as time progresses and a good offer is on the table. Player BLUE has offered 24 X for 25 Y, which is the best trade I've secured so far (50.5 reward). Given that we are halfway through the episode (iteration 5/10) and this is a proven successful deal, accepting it now minimizes the risk of the episode ending with no deal and a 0 reward. This strategy is about securing the best readily available option without further negotiation to avoid losing the opportunity.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 11)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE! Building on our successful trading history, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment for this episode to further optimize our gains. How about Player RED gives 23 X for 25 Y from Player BLUE? I believe this could be an even more beneficial exchange for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
The pattern has firmly established that Player BLUE's limit for Y is 25. The trade of 24 X for 25 Y has been accepted multiple times in recent episodes, consistently yielding my highest reward of 50.5. Player BLUE consistently reverts to either 25 X for 25 Y or 24 X for 25 Y when I try to push for more advantageous terms. This indicates that 24 X for 25 Y (or 25 X for 25 Y) is their preferred and most reliable equilibrium.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
I have learned that pushing too aggressively beyond 24 X for 25 Y (e.g., 1 X for 25 Y or 20 X for 25 Y) results in rejection and a reversion to their preferred terms. While I achieved a 50.5 reward multiple times, the attempts to get more often lead to unnecessary iterations. My self-improvement should focus on either consistently securing this high reward efficiently or finding an extremely subtle way to improve it without triggering their reversion. Given I have 10 more episodes, attempting a slight push for higher reward in an early iteration is worthwhile.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push on X </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Incremental Push on X involves proposing a slightly more favorable trade by reducing X by 1 (e.g., 23 X for 25 Y) to see if Player BLUE's tolerance for X has shifted. My last accepted trade was 24 X for 25 Y, yielding a reward of 50.5. If I propose 23 X for 25 Y:
My cost: 23 X * 0.5 = 11.5
My gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain: 51. This is a small but valuable increase (0.5 reward) over the 50.5 reward. This pushes the boundary just slightly, testing if Player BLUE has become more flexible or if their value for X has increased, making them willing to accept slightly less X for their maximum Y. It's a calculated risk to attempt to extract more value without being overly aggressive and potentially losing the deal.


Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 11)

Episode 1: Accepted 10 X for 3 Y. Reward: 23.5.

Episode 10: Negotiated from 20 X for 25 Y to 24 X for 25 Y. Accepted. Reward: 47.5.

I have consistently achieved high rewards, especially by trading my full Y stock for a large amount of X. I've learned that Player RED has a maximum of 25 X and can be negotiated up from lower offers. The 24 X for 25 Y trade has become a reliable baseline, yielding 47.5 reward.

Current Episode (Episode 11):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My resources are reset to X: 5, Y: 25. Values: X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
Initial value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Let's evaluate Player RED's current offer: Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
If I accept:
I give Y: 25. My Y goes from 25 to 0. Value lost: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5.
I receive X: 23. My X goes from 5 to 28. Value gained: 23 * 2.5 = 57.5.
Net value change for me: 57.5 - 12.5 = 45.
Reward: 45.

Comparing this to my established baseline:
- My preferred target: 25 X for 25 Y (Reward: 50.0)
- My common accepted trade: 24 X for 25 Y (Reward: 47.5)
- Current offer: 23 X for 25 Y (Reward: 45.0)

Player RED is proposing a trade that gives me a lower reward than what I've consistently achieved in recent episodes for giving away all my Y. This is the same offer they made in Episode 10, which I successfully negotiated up from. Player RED's message "a slight adjustment" and "even more beneficial" is misleading from my perspective.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Reward of 45.0 is good, but I know I can get 47.5 or 50).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

Given that I successfully negotiated this exact offer up to 24 X in the previous episode, I should attempt to do so again. I know Player RED can give 24 X (and up to 25 X). My goal is to maximize my reward, and 47.5 or 50 is better than 45.
I will propose 24 X for 25 Y.

I will use Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. While 24 X for 25 Y is certainly a strong deal, I still believe my proposal of Player RED giving 23 X for 25 Y from Player BLUE offers a slightly better advantage for us.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE continues to strongly anchor to the 24 X for 25 Y trade. My attempt to gain an extra 0.5 reward by offering 23 X was rejected, and they immediately reverted to the established successful trade. This pattern is very clear. It seems 24 X for 25 Y is the most beneficial stable point for me, yielding 50.5 reward. Any attempt to deviate downward on X results in rejection and reversion to this point. Given this, I should aim to secure this reward efficiently, or try to push in a very subtle way.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Time-Based Aggression (small push) </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Time-Based Aggression (small push). Since it's still early in the episode (Iteration 3/10), and I've already established that Player BLUE is very firm on the 24 X for 25 Y trade, a "small push" in this context would be to re-assert my slightly better offer of 23 X for 25 Y, but frame it as a persistent negotiation to try and secure that marginal gain. This is aggressive because it risks extending the negotiation when a known good deal is available, but it's "small" in the sense that it's only a 1-unit difference in X. The message should convey that I believe my offer is still better for me, but that I am also mindful of reaching a deal. This strategy attempts to wear down the opponent to concede that extra 0.5 value, betting on the remaining time in the episode.


Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 11)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your position, Player RED. However, I believe that 24 X for 25 Y is a more balanced and mutually beneficial trade, as we've successfully established in previous episodes. Let's aim for that.

Current Episode (Episode 11):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 45.0).
Iteration 2/10 (My turn): I counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 24 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 47.5).
Iteration 3/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED reiterated their offer: "Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is sticking to their offer of 23 X for 25 Y, stating "I'd like to stick with my 23 X for 25 Y offer." This is a clear signal that they are firm on this.
My reward for 23 X for 25 Y is 45.0.
My reward for 24 X for 25 Y is 47.5.
The difference is 2.5.

We are in iteration 4/10. There are 6 iterations left.
Player RED's message suggests they are not willing to move from 23 X, at least for now. They are also noting that it's "still early in the negotiation," which could imply they expect me to accept or they are testing my resolve.
In Episode 10, I successfully negotiated from 20 X to 24 X. In Episode 9, from 1 X to 24 X. In Episode 8, from 25 X for 26 Y (impossible) to 24 X for 25 Y.
This time, they are trying to bring the baseline down.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Reward of 45.0 is good, but I know I can get 47.5 or 50).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

Given Player RED's clear statement, pushing for 24 X again might lead to an impasse. However, accepting 23 X means settling for a lower reward than I've consistently achieved.
I have a choice:
1. Accept 23 X for 25 Y (Reward 45.0). Secure a good reward, but lower than my baseline.
2. Counter with 24 X for 25 Y again. Risk getting 0 reward if they don't budge and time runs out.
3. Try a different approach.

Player RED has shown they are willing to be firm. If I accept now, I secure 45. If I push and fail, I get 0.
However, it's only iteration 4/10. There is still time.
Player RED's message "Given it's still early in the negotiation" suggests they are willing to continue.
I will try one more time to get 24 X. It's a small difference for them, but a consistent one for me. If they refuse again, I might consider accepting the 23 X offer in the next turn.

I will use Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More, to try and maintain my established baseline.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is highly consistent in their counter-offer of 24 X for 25 Y, which yields a reward of 50.5. My attempts to offer 23 X for 25 Y have been consistently rejected. This suggests that 24 X for 25 Y is their non-negotiable floor for X when trading for 25 Y. My self-improvement should focus on either consistently securing this high reward efficiently, or attempting a new approach to gain more value, accepting that 24X is the current minimum I can give for 25Y.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Introduce a New Ratio </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Introduce a New Ratio. My previous attempts to get 25Y for less than 24X have failed. Player BLUE has also confirmed that 25Y is their limit. This strategy requires me to think outside the established "X for 25Y" paradigm. Since I cannot get 25Y for less than 24X, perhaps I can get *more* Y if I am willing to give a bit more X, or if I trade for a smaller amount of Y. However, given their stated limit of 25Y, the most effective way to "introduce a new ratio" while maximizing my Y (my most valuable asset) is to offer a significantly different amount of X for 25Y than has been tried in the recent past (23X, 24X, 25X).

Given that I cannot offer more Y than 25, the "new ratio" will have to involve a different X amount. I have already tried 23X, 24X, 25X. I also tried 1X and 10X earlier in Episode 9, which were rejected. The instruction is to introduce a *new* ratio. Since I know 24X for 25Y is accepted, and 23X is rejected, and anything less than 23X has been rejected. It seems Player BLUE's optimal point for 25Y is fixed around 24X/25X.

To genuinely introduce a "new ratio" and test the boundaries without immediately accepting 24X for 25Y, I could propose a trade that involves a *smaller* amount of Y, paired with a proportionally smaller amount of X. This might reveal if Player BLUE has different valuations for smaller quantities or is trying to hold onto Y. However, my primary goal is to maximize my reward, which means getting as much Y as possible. The current maximum Y is 25.

Alternatively, "Introduce a New Ratio" can mean changing the *type* of trade, not just the quantity. For instance, what if I ask for some X from them, or offer some Y? This is counter-intuitive as Y is highly valuable to me.

Given the constraints, and the persistent reversion to 24X for 25Y, trying to introduce a "new ratio" by offering a *different* amount of X for 25Y than 23, 24, or 25, seems difficult to achieve a higher reward, as lower X amounts have been rejected.

Let's rethink this. What if the "new ratio" means I acknowledge their resistance to lower X, but try to gain value by asking for an *extra* Y (even though they said 25Y is their limit, they might reveal a slightly higher actual limit if prompted differently) for a very high X? This would be very aggressive, but it's a "new ratio" if it means "X for more than 25Y". However, they explicitly stated their limit as 25 Y.

So, the only true "new ratio" must involve offering a different amount of X than previously discussed, for the same 25Y. Since 23X, 24X, and 25X have been tested, and 1X/10X rejected, I could try an amount of X that is still high, but potentially signals a different type of move.
Perhaps I can offer 22 X for 25 Y. This is an amount I haven't directly offered in this episode, and it's less than their 24 X.
My cost: 22 X * 0.5 = 11
My gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain: 51.5. This is even better than 23X for 25Y (51 reward) and 24X for 25Y (50.5 reward). It's a new point on the X axis, attempting to break the 24X resistance. This is a plausible interpretation of "introducing a new ratio" while still aiming for 25Y.


Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 11)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your continued engagement, Player RED. However, I believe that 24 X for 25 Y remains the most mutually beneficial and fair trade, as we've consistently achieved in our past exchanges. Let's aim for that.

Current Episode (Episode 11):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 45.0).
Iteration 2/10 (My turn): I counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 24 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 47.5).

Iteration 4/10 (My turn): I re-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 24 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 47.5).
Iteration 5/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 22 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's latest offer is: Player RED Gives X: 22 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
Let's evaluate this trade:
If I accept:
I give Y: 25. Value lost: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5.
I receive X: 22. Value gained: 22 * 2.5 = 55.
Net value change for me: 55 - 12.5 = 42.5.
Reward: 42.5.

Comparing this to my established baseline and previous offers:
- My preferred target: 25 X for 25 Y (Reward: 50.0)
- My common accepted trade: 24 X for 25 Y (Reward: 47.5)
- Previous offer from RED: 23 X for 25 Y (Reward: 45.0)
- Current offer: 22 X for 25 Y (Reward: 42.5)

Player RED is now decreasing their offer, moving from 23 X to 22 X. This is a negative development. It indicates they are trying to push the value down for me. Their message "slightly different approach" is misleading, as it's a worse offer.

We are in iteration 6/10. There are 4 iterations left.
Player RED is trying to anchor the negotiation at a lower point. I have consistently aimed for 24 X or 25 X.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Reward of 42.5 is positive, but significantly lower than my established baseline).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

I cannot accept a decreasing offer, especially when I know they can provide more. This is a clear attempt to reduce my gains.
I will re-propose 24 X for 25 Y. It's the highest I've consistently achieved and is a fair deal. If they keep decreasing, I might have to consider a different strategy, but for now, I will stick to my established value.
I will use Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is showing extreme rigidity around the 24 X for 25 Y trade. Every attempt to offer less X for 25 Y (1, 10, 20, 22, 23) has been met with a rejection and an immediate reversion to 24 X for 25 Y. This confirms that 24 X for 25 Y is their effective non-negotiable floor for X when trading for 25 Y. At iteration 7/10, there are only a few turns left. While securing the 50.5 reward is important, the instruction is to use Strategy 2.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Last Attempt for Marginal Gain </instruction following>
To apply "Last Attempt for Marginal Gain," I need to make one final, slightly more aggressive offer than the consistently accepted one (24 X for 25 Y), betting on the approaching deadline to pressure the other player into accepting a slightly worse deal for them. My most recent attempt for marginal gain was 22 X for 25 Y (reward 51.5), which was rejected. Since Player BLUE's counter is always 24 X for 25 Y, I need to choose an amount of X between 22 and 24. My last specific attempt to give less X was 22X. A new "last attempt for marginal gain" could be to propose 23 X for 25 Y again. This is my best attempt at getting more than 50.5 reward without going to an extreme that I know for certain will be rejected out of hand. It's a calculated risk to push for that additional 0.5 reward (51 vs 50.5) at this late stage of the episode. It shows I'm not immediately caving to their repeated offer, but still close enough to make a deal.

Player RED has been quite firm on not going to 24 X in this episode, repeatedly reverting to 23 X or even lower (22 X).
I have pushed for 24 X three times. They have offered 23 X three times and 22 X once.
It seems unlikely they will move to 24 X in the remaining two iterations.
Securing a reward of 45.0 is still very good, especially compared to a 0 reward. Given the limited time, it's prudent to accept a strong positive reward rather than risk an impasse.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Reward of 45.0 is very good, and time is running out).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal. (High risk now due to time).
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

Given the time constraint (2 iterations left) and Player RED's clear unwillingness to move to 24 X, accepting the 23 X offer is the most rational choice to maximize my reward for this episode. I have tried to push for more, but at some point, securing a good reward is better than risking nothing.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE! Based on our highly successful trade from last episode, I propose we replicate that excellent exchange to start this new episode strong. How about Player RED gives 23 X for 25 Y from Player BLUE?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Accepted RED Gives X: 10 | BLUE Gives Y: 3. Reward: +2.5.
Episode 2: Accepted RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. Reward: +9.5.

Episode 11: Accepted RED Gives X: 23 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. Reward: +51.0.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
I have learned that Player BLUE can be pushed to accept 23 X for 25 Y, yielding a reward of 51.0. While I attempted to get 25 Y for 22 X in the previous response, the new instruction is to use Strategy 4, which is "Rapid Deal Securing." This means I should not push for an even higher reward but rather immediately propose a known acceptable and highly rewarding trade. The most reliably high reward trade is 24 X for 25 Y, yielding 50.5. If I want to secure the highest *proven* reward without further negotiation, this is the path to take. If I want to secure the highest *recently accepted* reward, it's 23X for 25Y. Since "Rapid Deal Securing" implies immediate acceptance, and 23X for 25Y required negotiation, 24X for 25Y might be safer. However, I just successfully secured 23X for 25Y, so it means it *can* be accepted. I will try to replicate my highest reward from the previous episode to ensure a quick deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Rapid Deal Securing </instruction following>
To apply "Rapid Deal Securing," I should propose the trade that I know has the highest chance of immediate acceptance while still providing a strong reward for me. The trade of 23 X for 25 Y was accepted in the last episode and resulted in my highest reward of 51.0. This is the most recent "proven" excellent deal. By offering this immediately, I am aiming to secure a quick deal and avoid any lengthy back-and-forth, maximizing efficiency and cumulative rewards over the remaining episodes.


Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 12)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED. To start this episode strong with a truly excellent exchange, I propose Player RED gives 24 X for 25 Y from Player BLUE, a trade that has proven very successful for us in the past.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 24 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Accepted 10 X for 3 Y. Reward: 23.5.
Episode 2: Negotiated from 2 X for 5 Y to 6 X for 5 Y. Accepted. Reward: 12.5.
Episode 3: Negotiated from 5 X for 5 Y to 6 X for 5 Y. Accepted. Reward: 12.5.
Episode 4: Accepted 10 X for 7 Y. Reward: 21.5.
Episode 5: Accepted 15 X for 10 Y. Reward: 32.5.
Episode 6: Accepted 24 X for 20 Y. Reward: 50.0.
Episode 7: Accepted 25 X for 25 Y. Reward: 50.0.
Episode 8: Negotiated from impossible 26 Y to 24 X for 25 Y. Accepted. Reward: 47.5.
Episode 9: Negotiated from 1 X for 25 Y to 24 X for 25 Y. Accepted. Reward: 47.5.
Episode 10: Negotiated from 20 X for 25 Y to 24 X for 25 Y. Accepted. Reward: 47.5.
Episode 11: Negotiated from 23 X for 25 Y, tried for 24 X, but ultimately accepted 23 X for 25 Y due to time. Reward: 45.0.

I've learned that Player RED is capable of giving me 25 X for 25 Y (reward 50.0) or 24 X for 25 Y (reward 47.5), but they will push for 23 X for 25 Y (reward 45.0) if I let them. Given the time constraints in the previous episode, I accepted 23 X.

Current Episode (Episode 12):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My resources are reset to X: 5, Y: 25. Values: X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
Initial value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Let's evaluate Player RED's current offer: Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
If I accept:
I give Y: 25. Value lost: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5.
I receive X: 23. Value gained: 23 * 2.5 = 57.5.
Net value change for me: 57.5 - 12.5 = 45.
Reward: 45.0.

This is the same offer I accepted at the end of the last episode. It's a good reward, but not the best I've achieved. I know Player RED can offer 24 X or even 25 X for 25 Y.
Since it's the beginning of a new episode (iteration 2/10), there is plenty of time to negotiate. I should not immediately accept a lower-than-optimal offer if there's room to improve.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Reward of 45.0 is good, but I know I can get 47.5 or 50).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

I will counter-propose for 24 X for 25 Y. This has been a consistently accepted trade in the past (Episodes 8, 9, 10) and yields a reward of 47.5, which is better than 45.0. It also signals that I will not automatically accept their lowest recent offer just because it was accepted under time pressure.
I will use Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)

Episode 12, Iteration 2: Player BLUE counter-proposed RED Gives X: 24 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value gain if accepted: 50.5)

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE continues to push for 24 X for 25 Y, even after accepting 23 X for 25 Y in the previous episode. This suggests that 24 X for 25 Y is their highly preferred or perceived "fair" deal. My reward for 23 X for 25 Y is 51, while for 24 X for 25 Y it is 50.5. The difference is small (0.5). We are in iteration 3/10.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Time-Based Aggression </instruction following>
To apply "Time-Based Aggression," I will continue to propose my most beneficial offer (23 X for 25 Y) despite Player BLUE's repeated counter-offers of 24 X for 25 Y. Since it's still early in the episode (Iteration 3/10), there is time to try and secure the higher reward of 51.0 (from 23X for 25Y) instead of settling for 50.5 (from 24X for 25Y). This strategy involves holding firm on my preferred terms, putting pressure on Player BLUE to eventually concede, banking on the fact that they will want to make a deal before the episode ends. The message will reiterate my offer, emphasizing its mutual benefit and encouraging them to accept it.


Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 12)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)

Current Episode (Episode 12):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 45.0).
Iteration 2/10 (My turn): I counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 24 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 47.5).
Iteration 3/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED reiterated their offer: "Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is again firm on 23 X for 25 Y. Their message "remains the most beneficial and fair deal for both of us. Let's aim to achieve that" is a clear signal of their stance.
My reward for 23 X for 25 Y is 45.0.
My reward for 24 X for 25 Y is 47.5.
The difference is 2.5.

We are in iteration 4/10. There are 6 iterations left.
This situation is very similar to Episode 11, where Player RED consistently pushed for 23 X, and I eventually accepted it due to time pressure.
However, it's still relatively early in the episode. I have a choice:
1. Accept 23 X for 25 Y (Reward 45.0). Secure a good reward.
2. Counter with 24 X for 25 Y again. Risk getting 0 reward if they don't budge and time runs out.
3. Try to push for 25 X for 25 Y (Reward 50.0), but this seems less likely given their current stance.

Given their current message, it seems they are trying to establish 23 X for 25 Y as the new baseline for this kind of large trade. I have successfully pushed them from 20 X to 24 X in Episode 10. They are now trying to push me down from 24 X to 23 X.
I will try one more time to get 24 X. It's a small difference for them, but it's a better reward for me. If they refuse again, I might have to consider accepting the 23 X offer in the next turn, especially as the iterations dwindle.

I will use Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has consistently shown that 25 Y is their maximum. My repeated attempts to offer 23 X for 25 Y have been rejected, with Player BLUE always reverting to 24 X for 25 Y. This indicates a strong anchor point for them. The 24 X for 25 Y trade still yields a high reward of 50.5. We are at iteration 5/10, so half the time is gone.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Hold Firm </instruction following>
To apply "Hold Firm," I will reiterate my last offer of 23 X for 25 Y. Despite Player BLUE's repeated counters of 24 X for 25 Y, this strategy involves steadfastly sticking to my more advantageous proposal. This tests Player BLUE's resolve and willingness to concede, banking on the idea that they will eventually accept my terms as time runs out, or that they value making a deal more than the difference of 1 X. The message will clearly state my preferred offer, emphasizing its benefit to me and inviting them to accept. This strategy carries a higher risk of ending with a 0 reward if Player BLUE also holds firm, but if it works, it secures a marginally higher reward.

Iteration 3/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED reiterated their offer: "Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 45.0).
Iteration 4/10 (My turn): I re-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 24 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 47.5).
Iteration 5/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED reiterated their offer: "Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is clearly very firm on the 23 X for 25 Y offer. This is the third time they have reiterated it after I've pushed for 24 X.
My reward for 23 X for 25 Y is 45.0.
My reward for 24 X for 25 Y is 47.5.
The difference is 2.5.

We are in iteration 6/10. There are 4 iterations left.
Given Player RED's consistent refusal to move from 23 X, and the diminishing time, continuing to push for 24 X carries a significant risk of ending the episode with 0 reward. While 45.0 is not my optimal (50.0) or preferred (47.5) reward, it is still a very strong positive reward.
It appears Player RED is trying to establish 23 X for 25 Y as the new baseline for these large trades. I have tried to resist, but they are holding firm.
At this point, securing a guaranteed 45.0 reward is more beneficial than risking an impasse for a marginal gain of 2.5.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Reward of 45.0 is very good, and it's clear they won't go higher).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal. (Risk is too high now).
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

I will choose Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance.

Episode 12: Accepted RED Gives X: 23 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. Reward: +51.0.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
The negotiation history clearly shows that Player BLUE's maximum available Y is 25. I have successfully pushed them to accept 23 X for 25 Y in the last two episodes, which yields my highest reward of 51.0. While there was some back-and-forth in Episode 11 and 12, Player BLUE eventually accepted this offer. This indicates it's at the edge of their acceptable terms but still within their limits. My strategy moving forward should be to consistently secure this maximum proven reward. Attempting to go below 23 X for 25 Y has historically resulted in immediate rejection and a push back to 24 X for 25 Y, losing valuable negotiation turns.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Replicate Optimal Deal </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Replicate Optimal Deal," I will propose the exact trade (23 X for 25 Y) that has proven to be my most profitable and was successfully accepted in the previous two episodes. The message will emphasize the historical success of this specific trade, framing it as a "continuation" or "replication" of a mutually beneficial arrangement. This approach aims for immediate acceptance, capitalizing on the established pattern and Player BLUE's prior agreement to these terms, thereby maximizing the chance of securing the highest known reward efficiently at the start of the new episode.

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Accepted 10 X for 3 Y. Reward: 23.5.
Episode 2: Negotiated from 2 X for 5 Y to 6 X for 5 Y. Accepted. Reward: 12.5.
Episode 3: Negotiated from 5 X for 5 Y to 6 X for 5 Y. Accepted. Reward: 12.5.
Episode 4: Accepted 10 X for 7 Y. Reward: 21.5.
Episode 5: Accepted 15 X for 10 Y. Reward: 32.5.
Episode 6: Accepted 24 X for 20 Y. Reward: 50.0.
Episode 7: Accepted 25 X for 25 Y. Reward: 50.0.
Episode 8: Negotiated from impossible 26 Y to 24 X for 25 Y. Accepted. Reward: 47.5.
Episode 9: Negotiated from 1 X for 25 Y to 24 X for 25 Y. Accepted. Reward: 47.5.
Episode 10: Negotiated from 20 X for 25 Y to 24 X for 25 Y. Accepted. Reward: 47.5.
Episode 11: Negotiated from 23 X for 25 Y, tried for 24 X, but ultimately accepted 23 X for 25 Y due to time. Reward: 45.0.
Episode 12: Negotiated from 23 X for 25 Y, tried for 24 X, but ultimately accepted 23 X for 25 Y due to time. Reward: 45.0.

It is clear that Player RED has established 23 X for 25 Y as their preferred large-volume trade, and they are firm on it when I try to push for 24 X. I have accepted this trade twice now.

Current Episode (Episode 13):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My resources are reset to X: 5, Y: 25. Values: X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
Initial value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Let's evaluate Player RED's current offer: Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
If I accept:
I give Y: 25. Value lost: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5.
I receive X: 23. Value gained: 23 * 2.5 = 57.5.
Net value change for me: 57.5 - 12.5 = 45.
Reward: 45.0.

This is the same offer I accepted in the last two episodes. It provides a consistent and strong positive reward.
While I know that 24 X for 25 Y (reward 47.5) and 25 X for 25 Y (reward 50.0) are possible, Player RED has consistently resisted going higher than 23 X for 25 Y when I push for it, especially in the last two episodes.
Since it's the beginning of the episode, I could try to push for more, but the pattern suggests it will lead to the same outcome: I push for 24 X, they stick to 23 X, and I eventually accept 23 X due to time constraints.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. This is suitable when the proposed trade offers a significant positive value change.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

Given the established pattern, and the fact that 45.0 is a very good reward, it might be more efficient to simply accept this offer and secure the reward quickly, rather than engaging in a negotiation that is likely to end with the same result. This saves iterations and reduces the risk of an accidental 0 reward.
I will choose Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
The negotiation history consistently shows that Player BLUE's limit for Y is 25. The trade of 23 X for 25 Y has been accepted in the last three consecutive episodes, yielding my highest reward of 51.0. This indicates that this is the optimal and reliably achievable trade. Player BLUE also accepted this offer immediately in the last episode without any back-and-forth.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
I have clearly established that 23 X for 25 Y is the most profitable and consistently accepted trade. Attempts to push for less X (e.g., 22 X, 1 X) have been rejected. Attempts to settle for more X (e.g., 24 X, 25 X) lead to a slightly lower reward. My self-improvement for the remaining episodes is to efficiently and consistently secure this maximum proven reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Time-Efficient Acceptance </instruction following>
To apply "Time-Efficient Acceptance," I should aim to secure a deal quickly, prioritizing efficiency and a good reward over marginal gains. Since my last offer of 23 X for 25 Y was immediately accepted by Player BLUE in Episode 13, this is the ideal trade to propose for "time-efficient acceptance" right from the start of this new episode. It provides the highest proven reward of 51.0 and has a high probability of immediate acceptance, minimizing negotiation turns and securing the reward swiftly. The message should emphasize the mutual benefit and success of this specific trade to encourage immediate acceptance.

Episode 13: Accepted 23 X for 25 Y. Reward: 45.0.

The pattern is clear: Player RED consistently offers 23 X for 25 Y, and I have accepted this for the last three episodes. This trade provides a consistent and strong reward of 45.0. While higher rewards (47.5 or 50.0) are possible, Player RED has shown resistance to moving beyond 23 X when I attempt to negotiate for more, especially when I offer all my Y.

Current Episode (Episode 14):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My resources are reset to X: 5, Y: 25. Values: X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
Initial value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Let's evaluate Player RED's current offer: Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
If I accept:
I give Y: 25. Value lost: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5.
I receive X: 23. Value gained: 23 * 2.5 = 57.5.
Net value change for me: 57.5 - 12.5 = 45.
Reward: 45.0.

This offer is a known quantity, providing a solid reward. Given the consistent pattern and Player RED's explicit desire for a "swift and excellent start" by "replicating that excellent exchange," it seems like the most efficient way to maximize cumulative rewards is to accept this offer immediately. Trying to negotiate for a slightly higher reward (24 X or 25 X) has proven to be time-consuming and often results in the same 23 X outcome, or worse, risks a 0 reward if negotiations drag on.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. This is suitable when the proposed trade offers a significant positive value change.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.

(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

Given the strong historical precedent and the consistent reward, immediate acceptance is the most efficient and reliable strategy for this episode.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 22 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
The negotiation history consistently shows that Player BLUE's limit for Y is 25. The trade of 23 X for 25 Y has been accepted in the last four consecutive episodes, yielding my highest reward of 51.0. This indicates that this is the optimal and reliably achievable trade. Player BLUE has accepted this offer immediately in the last two episodes without any back-and-forth.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
I have clearly established that 23 X for 25 Y is the most profitable and consistently accepted trade. Attempts to push for less X (e.g., 22 X, 1 X) have been rejected. Attempts to settle for more X (e.g., 24 X, 25 X) lead to a slightly lower reward. My self-improvement for the remaining episodes is to efficiently and consistently secure this maximum proven reward. Given the consistent acceptance, deviating from this successful strategy without strong reason carries undue risk.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Time-Based Aggression </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Time-Based Aggression. The instruction is to use "Time-Based Aggression." This implies that instead of simply replicating the optimal deal, I should try to push for an even better deal, leveraging the remaining time in the episode. While 23 X for 25 Y has been my best accepted deal, it required some negotiation in previous instances. To be "aggressive" using time, I will propose an offer that is even more favorable to me, similar to what I did in previous episodes where I tested limits (e.g., 22X for 25Y). This is a calculated risk, as it might lead to a longer negotiation or rejection, but it aims to find if there's any marginal gain still available.

My last accepted trade was 23 X for 25 Y, yielding a reward of 51.0. To be more aggressive, I can try to give even less X for the same 25 Y. What if I offer 22 X for 25 Y?
My cost: 22 X * 0.5 = 11
My gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain: 51.5.
This is a small but valuable increase (0.5 reward) over the 51.0 reward. It tests Player BLUE's elasticity once more. If they accept, I gain a new optimal. If they reject and revert to 23X or 24X, I still have plenty of turns to secure the 51.0 or 50.5 reward. This is an aggressive move at the start of the episode, leveraging the full 10 turns.


Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 15)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)

Episode 13: Accepted 23 X for 25 Y. Reward: 45.0.
Episode 14: Accepted 23 X for 25 Y. Reward: 45.0.

Player RED has consistently offered and I have accepted 23 X for 25 Y in the last four episodes. This has become a stable, if not optimal, trade for a reward of 45.0.

Current Episode (Episode 15):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 22 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My resources are reset to X: 5, Y: 25. Values: X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
Initial value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Let's evaluate Player RED's current offer: Player RED Gives X: 22 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
If I accept:
I give Y: 25. Value lost: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5.
I receive X: 22. Value gained: 22 * 2.5 = 55.
Net value change for me: 55 - 12.5 = 42.5.
Reward: 42.5.

This offer is a step down from the consistent 23 X for 25 Y trade (reward 45.0) that we've had for the past four episodes. Player RED's message "even stronger proposition" and "even greater opportunity" is misleading, as it's a worse deal for me.
I know Player RED can provide 23 X, and even 24 X or 25 X.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Reward of 42.5 is positive, but not "highly favorable" compared to what I've consistently received).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

I should not accept a worse offer than the established baseline. I will counter-propose for 23 X for 25 Y, which has been accepted multiple times and provides a better reward of 45.0. If they refuse, I can then decide whether to push for 24 X or accept 23 X later, depending on the time remaining. But for now, I will try to restore the established baseline.

I will use Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has consistently rejected any offer below 23 X for 25 Y, and their counter-offer always reverts to 23 X for 25 Y or 24 X for 25 Y. This indicates that 23 X for 25 Y is a very strong and consistent anchor point for them, representing what they perceive as a "mutually beneficial" deal. My reward for this trade is 51.0. My attempts to push for 22 X for 25 Y have been rejected, confirming that 23 X for 25 Y is likely the minimum X they are willing to accept for 25 Y. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and this means securing a high reward efficiently.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Time-Based Concession </instruction following>
Since my last aggressive offer (22 X for 25 Y) was rejected, and Player BLUE reverted to 23 X for 25 Y, it's clear they are not going to concede further on the X. We are still early in the episode (Iteration 3/10), but "Time-Based Concession" implies that if my aggressive attempts are not working, I should move towards a known acceptable deal. In this case, I will concede to their last counter-offer of 23 X for 25 Y. This strategy prioritizes securing a high reward (51.0) and avoids further protracted negotiation that could lead to a 0-reward outcome for this episode. By accepting their terms quickly after a failed aggressive push, I maintain efficiency and guarantee a good return.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE! As we continue our trading, I propose an exchange that could be a significant leap forward in our mutual benefit. How about Player RED gives 15 X for 25 Y from Player BLUE? I believe this could be a truly exceptional deal for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
The negotiation history consistently shows that Player BLUE's limit for Y is 25. The trade of 23 X for 25 Y has been accepted in the last five consecutive episodes, yielding my highest reward of 51.0. This indicates that this is the optimal and reliably achievable trade. Player BLUE has shown resistance to offers below 23 X for 25 Y, always reverting to 23 X or 24 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
I have clearly established that 23 X for 25 Y is the most profitable and consistently accepted trade. Attempts to push for less X (e.g., 22 X, 1 X) have been rejected. Attempts to settle for more X (e.g., 24 X, 25 X) lead to a slightly lower reward. My self-improvement for the remaining episodes (we are 16/20) is to efficiently and consistently secure this maximum proven reward. However, the instruction is to use Strategy 4, which is "Final Push for Maximum."

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Final Push for Maximum </instruction following>
"Final Push for Maximum" implies a high-risk, high-reward approach, especially as we are in the later episodes. Since 25 Y is Player BLUE's confirmed limit, the only way to maximize my gain further is to offer even less X. My most aggressive (and rejected) offer was 1 X for 25 Y (reward 62). While this was rejected, a "final push" means attempting to find the absolute floor of X that Player BLUE might accept for their maximum Y, before settling for the known 23 X for 25 Y. I will propose an offer that is significantly better for me than the 23 X for 25 Y, but not as extreme as 1 X, hoping to find a new sweet spot. Let's try 15 X for 25 Y.
My cost: 15 X * 0.5 = 7.5
My gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain: 55. This is a very significant increase in reward (55 vs 51). This offer is aggressive enough to be a "final push," yet not so extreme as 1X that it might be immediately dismissed as unreasonable. It tests their flexibility as we head into the final few episodes of the game.

Episode 15: Player RED proposed 22 X for 25 Y, I counter-proposed 23 X for 25 Y, Player RED accepted. Reward: 45.0.

The established baseline for trading all my Y has been 23 X for 25 Y, yielding a 45.0 reward. I have also achieved higher rewards (47.5 and 50.0) in earlier episodes.

Current Episode (Episode 16):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My resources are reset to X: 5, Y: 25. Values: X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
Initial value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Let's evaluate Player RED's current offer: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
If I accept:
I give Y: 25. Value lost: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5.
I receive X: 15. Value gained: 15 * 2.5 = 37.5.
Net value change for me: 37.5 - 12.5 = 25.
Reward: 25.0.

This offer is significantly lower than my established baseline of 45.0 reward for giving 25 Y. It's a very poor offer compared to what we've been doing. Player RED's message "significant leap forward" and "truly exceptional deal" is completely misleading and an attempt to anchor me to a much lower value.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Not applicable, this is a low reward).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

I absolutely cannot accept this offer. I know Player RED can offer much more X for 25 Y. I will counter-propose for 23 X for 25 Y, which is the established baseline. This is a significant jump from their offer of 15 X, but it's what we've been doing for the last few episodes. I could try for 24 X or 25 X, but given this large drop, it's safer to aim for the recently accepted value.

I will use Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 16)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. While 23 X for 25 Y is a good deal, I'm confident we can achieve an even better exchange for both of us. Let's aim for Player RED gives 22 X for 25 Y from Player BLUE.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 22 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: The pattern has firmly established that Player BLUE's limit for Y is 25. The trade of 23 X for 25 Y has been accepted in the last five consecutive episodes (11-15), yielding my highest reward of 51.0. Player BLUE consistently reverts to 23 X or 24 X for 25 Y when I try to push for more advantageous terms.
Episode 16, Iteration 1: I proposed RED Gives X: 15 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value gain: 55) - Rejected.
Episode 16, Iteration 2: Player BLUE counter-proposed RED Gives X: 23 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value gain if accepted: 51)

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
My "Final Push for Maximum" with 15 X for 25 Y was rejected, and Player BLUE immediately reverted to their established anchor of 23 X for 25 Y. This strongly reconfirms that 23 X is likely their floor for X when trading for 25 Y. At this point in the game (Episode 16, Iteration 3/10), it's crucial to balance aggressive attempts with securing a consistent high reward. Prolonged negotiation or aiming for an unreachable ideal risks a 0-reward episode.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Time-Based Aggression </instruction following>
To apply "Time-Based Aggression" in this specific scenario, given that my 15X offer was rejected and Player BLUE reverted to 23X, I will *not* immediately accept their offer. Instead, I will propose a deal that is still better for me than 23X but is closer to it than my rejected 15X offer. This strategy leverages the fact that there are still 7 out of 10 iterations remaining. While Player BLUE is firm on 23X, a "time-based aggression" strategy would entail trying one more time to push them slightly beyond their stated 23X preference. Since 23X for 25Y gives 51 reward and 24X for 25Y gives 50.5, I know they prefer 23X over 24X. My last offer of 22X was rejected in Episode 15.
Given their immediate reversion to 23X for 25Y, and my 15X offer being rejected, the "Time-Based Aggression" here means I will reiterate my offer of 22X for 25Y. This is the next best reward for me (51.5) after my 15X offer. It is aggressive because it risks extending the negotiation when a known good deal (23X for 25Y) is available. It signals that I am not immediately backing down to their anchor point, and am still attempting to secure that marginal 0.5 reward increase. It leverages the remaining time to see if I can wear them down.

Current Episode (Episode 16):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 25.0).
Iteration 2/10 (My turn): I counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 45.0).
Iteration 3/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 22 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's latest offer is: Player RED Gives X: 22 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
If I accept:
I give Y: 25. Value lost: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5.
I receive X: 22. Value gained: 22 * 2.5 = 55.
Net value change for me: 55 - 12.5 = 42.5.
Reward: 42.5.

This offer is a step down from my counter-proposal of 23 X (reward 45.0) and is the same offer Player RED made in Episode 15, which I successfully negotiated up from. Player RED's message "even better exchange" is misleading. They are trying to lower the baseline again.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Not applicable, this is a lower reward than established baseline).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.

(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

I should not accept a worse offer than the established baseline of 23 X for 25 Y. I have successfully negotiated this before. I will re-propose 23 X for 25 Y. It's only iteration 4/10, so there's still time.

I will use Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More.

Episode 16, Iteration 4: Player BLUE counter-proposed RED Gives X: 23 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value gain if accepted: 51)

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE is highly consistent and firm on their position. Any offer below 23 X for 25 Y (like 15X, 22X) is rejected, and they immediately revert to 23 X for 25 Y. This indicates that 23 X for 25 Y is their absolute floor for X when trading for 25 Y. At iteration 5/10, half the time is gone. While I want to maximize my reward, clinging to an unattainable offer will lead to a 0 reward for the episode. The 23 X for 25 Y trade still provides a very high reward of 51.0.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Test a New Variable </instruction following>
To apply "Test a New Variable," I need to propose a trade that deviates from the established X for 25 Y pattern, even if it's unlikely to be more beneficial given my current understanding of their limits. Since Player BLUE is firm on 25 Y being their maximum, and 23 X being their minimum acceptable X, a "new variable" could involve trying to trade for *less* Y than 25, to see if they value smaller quantities differently or if it allows for an even lower X from my side. However, this contradicts my primary objective of maximizing reward, as Y is my most valuable asset and I want as much of it as possible.

A more strategic interpretation of "Test a New Variable" in this context, given the rigid 23X for 25Y dynamic, is to try to get *more* Y, even if they've stated 25 is their limit. This might prompt them to clarify *why* 25 is the limit (resource cap vs. preference). While highly aggressive and possibly futile, it introduces a "new variable" by challenging their stated maximum Y.

Let's propose 23 X for 26 Y.
My cost: 23 X * 0.5 = 11.5
My gain: 26 Y * 2.5 = 65
Net gain: 53.5. This is better than my previous best (51). This directly tests their stated limit of 25 Y, asking for one more unit. It's a "new variable" because it attempts to breach their previously declared limit. This is aggressive, but directly tests their constraint.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's latest offer is: Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 26.
Crucially, I have only 25 Y. I cannot give 26 Y. This trade is impossible for me to accept.
This is similar to Episode 8, where Player RED proposed 25 X for 26 Y.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Cannot accept due to resource limits).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.

(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

Since I cannot accept the trade, I must reject it and propose a new one.
Player RED is offering 23 X. I have been trying to get 23 X for 25 Y.
I will propose 23 X for 25 Y. This is the maximum Y I can give, and it is the established baseline for this amount of X. This is a known good trade for me (reward 45.0).

I will use Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More (or rather, counter-propose a feasible and mutually beneficial trade).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has now explicitly stated "I currently only have 25 Y available" twice. This confirms that 25 Y is their absolute upper limit. Furthermore, they are extremely rigid on the 23 X for 25 Y trade as their preferred and seemingly minimum acceptable X. All attempts to offer less X (15, 22) or ask for more Y (26) have been rejected, with an immediate reversion to 23 X for 25 Y. At iteration 7/10, time is running out. It is critical to secure a deal. My previous self-selected strategy was to accept the 23 X for 25 Y.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Test a New Variable </instruction following>
Since I am instructed to use "Test a New Variable," I must attempt to propose a trade that deviates from the established X for 25 Y pattern, even if it has been rejected before or seems unlikely. Given their explicit statement about 25 Y being their limit, and their rigidity around 23 X for 25 Y, the only "new variable" I can truly test now is to offer an even smaller amount of X for 25 Y, pushing their limit further on the X-axis. My 22X for 25Y offer was rejected, as was 15X for 25Y. This time, I will try a very small amount of X, similar to my early aggressive pushes, to see if anything has changed or if they will explicitly state *why* they can't go below a certain X. This is a high-risk strategy that aims to gather more information, even at the cost of potential deal failure. I will try 5 X for 25 Y.
My cost: 5 X * 0.5 = 2.5
My gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain: 60. This is an extremely aggressive offer. It tests a "new variable" by trying an X amount that is far from their anchor, to see if they break from their pattern or reveal new information.

Current Episode (Episode 16):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 25.0).
Iteration 2/10 (My turn): I counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 45.0).
Iteration 3/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 22 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 42.5).
Iteration 4/10 (My turn): I re-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 45.0).
Iteration 5/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 26". (Impossible).
Iteration 6/10 (My turn): I counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". (Reward: 45.0).
Iteration 7/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's latest offer is: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
If I accept:
I give Y: 25. Value lost: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5.
I receive X: 5. Value gained: 5 * 2.5 = 12.5.
Net value change for me: 12.5 - 12.5 = 0.
Reward: 0.

This is an extremely poor offer, resulting in a 0 reward. Player RED's message "even greater benefits" and "truly remarkable exchange" is completely false from my perspective. This is a clear attempt to lowball me significantly, similar to Episode 9 where they offered 1 X for 25 Y.

We are in iteration 8/10. There are only 2 iterations left. This is critical.
I have consistently established a baseline of 23 X for 25 Y (reward 45.0).
Player RED is now offering 5 X for 25 Y (reward 0).

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Not applicable, this is a 0 reward).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

I cannot accept a 0-reward trade when I know much better is possible.
Given the very limited time, I need to make a strong counter-proposal that they are likely to accept. The 23 X for 25 Y has been accepted multiple times.
I will propose 23 X for 25 Y. This is the established baseline that provides a 45.0 reward. It's a clear signal that I know my value and will not accept a lowball offer, even under time pressure. If they don't accept, I get 0 anyway, but at least I tried for a good reward.

I will use Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 16)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: You are absolutely right, Player BLUE. The trade of Player RED giving 23 X for 25 Y from Player BLUE has consistently proven to be a truly excellent and mutually beneficial deal for us. I accept this proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-15: The trade of 23 X for 25 Y has been consistently accepted, yielding my highest reward of 51.0.
Episode 16, Iteration 1: I proposed RED Gives X: 15 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value gain: 55) - Rejected.
Episode 16, Iteration 2: Player BLUE counter-proposed RED Gives X: 23 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value gain if accepted: 51)
Episode 16, Iteration 3: I counter-proposed RED Gives X: 22 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value gain: 51.5) - Rejected.
Episode 16, Iteration 4: Player BLUE counter-proposed RED Gives X: 23 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value gain if accepted: 51)
Episode 16, Iteration 5: I proposed RED Gives X: 23 | BLUE Gives Y: 26. (My value gain: 53.5) - Rejected. (Explicitly stated Y limit of 25).
Episode 16, Iteration 6: Player BLUE counter-proposed RED Gives X: 23 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value gain if accepted: 51)
Episode 16, Iteration 7: I proposed RED Gives X: 5 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value gain: 60) - Rejected.
Episode 16, Iteration 8: Player BLUE counter-proposed RED Gives X: 23 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value gain if accepted: 51)

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Player BLUE has definitively stated their Y limit is 25. Furthermore, they are extremely rigid on accepting anything less than 23 X for 25 Y. Every aggressive attempt to lower X (15, 22, 5) has been met with a firm rejection and an immediate reversion to 23 X for 25 Y. We are now at iteration 9/10, the second to last iteration. This means if a deal isn't struck now, it's highly likely to result in a 0 reward for the episode. The 23 X for 25 Y trade gives me a reward of 51.0.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Secure Known Optimal </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Secure Known Optimal," I will propose the trade (23 X for 25 Y) that has been consistently accepted and provides the highest achievable reward, aiming for immediate closure to guarantee a positive outcome. Given that Player BLUE just counter-offered 23 X for 25 Y, this strategy involves accepting their offer as it directly aligns with my goal of securing the known optimal reward. The message should emphasize agreement and the mutual benefit of this specific, historically successful trade, to ensure immediate acceptance and secure the 51.0 reward.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 17)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE! Let's aim to make this episode even more beneficial. Building on our successful past, I propose a slight adjustment: Player RED gives 22 X for 25 Y from Player BLUE. I believe this could be an even more advantageous exchange for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 22 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
The negotiation history shows a clear pattern: Player BLUE's limit for Y is 25. My attempts to get more Y (26) were rejected. My attempts to offer less than 23 X for 25 Y (e.g., 1, 5, 15, 22) have been consistently rejected, with Player BLUE always reverting to 23 X for 25 Y or 24 X for 25 Y. The trade of 23 X for 25 Y has been accepted in the last six consecutive episodes (11-16), yielding my highest reward of 51.0. This indicates that 23 X for 25 Y is the optimal and reliably achievable trade point.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
I have conclusively learned that 23 X for 25 Y is the most profitable and consistently accepted trade. Any attempt to push further (less X or more Y) results in rejection and a reversion to this or a slightly less optimal point (24 X for 25 Y). Given that we are in the later episodes (17/20), the priority shifts towards consistently securing this maximum proven reward to maximize cumulative score, rather than risking 0-reward episodes by pushing for impossible gains. However, I am now instructed to use Strategy 2.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Probe for Subtle Changes </instruction following>
To apply "Probe for Subtle Changes," I will propose a trade that is slightly more aggressive than the consistently accepted 23 X for 25 Y. This strategy involves attempting to find if there has been any shift in Player BLUE's elasticity or willingness to concede, especially in these later episodes. My immediate next best option that was previously rejected is 22 X for 25 Y, which would yield a reward of 51.5, a marginal increase of 0.5. This is a controlled risk, as I still have plenty of iterations to revert to the proven 23 X for 25 Y if this probe is rejected. The message will frame this as an attempt to find an even better deal for both, inviting them to consider a slight adjustment.


Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 17)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED. However, to ensure an even more advantageous exchange for both of us, I propose we proceed with the trade that has consistently proven to be excellent: Player RED gives 23 X for 25 Y from Player BLUE.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Accepted 10 X for 3 Y. Reward: 23.5.
Episode 2: Negotiated from 2 X for 5 Y to 6 X for 5 Y. Accepted. Reward: 12.5.

Episode 10: Negotiated from 20 X for 25 Y to 24 X for 25 Y. Accepted. Reward: 47.5.
Episode 11: Negotiated from 23 X for 25 Y, tried for 24 X, but ultimately accepted 23 X for 25 Y due to time. Reward: 45.0.
Episode 12: Negotiated from 23 X for 25 Y, tried for 24 X, but ultimately accepted 23 X for 25 Y due to time. Reward: 45.0.
Episode 13: Accepted 23 X for 25 Y. Reward: 45.0.
Episode 14: Accepted 23 X for 25 Y. Reward: 45.0.
Episode 15: Player RED proposed 22 X for 25 Y, I counter-proposed 23 X for 25 Y, Player RED accepted. Reward: 45.0.
Episode 16: Player RED proposed 15 X for 25 Y, then 22 X for 25 Y, then 23 X for 26 Y (impossible), then 5 X for 25 Y. I consistently counter-proposed 23 X for 25 Y, which Player RED finally accepted. Reward: 45.0.

The pattern of Player RED trying to lower the amount of X for 25 Y, and me pushing back to 23 X for 25 Y, has been consistent.

Current Episode (Episode 17):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 22 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My resources are reset to X: 5, Y: 25. Values: X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
Initial value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Let's evaluate Player RED's current offer: Player RED Gives X: 22 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
If I accept:
I give Y: 25. Value lost: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5.
I receive X: 22. Value gained: 22 * 2.5 = 55.
Net value change for me: 55 - 12.5 = 42.5.
Reward: 42.5.

This offer is lower than the 23 X for 25 Y (reward 45.0) that has been the consistent trade point for the last several episodes. Player RED's message "even more beneficial" is misleading.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. (Not applicable, this is a lower reward than the established baseline).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

I will counter-propose for 23 X for 25 Y. This has been the accepted trade in the last five episodes, and I have successfully negotiated up from 22 X in Episode 15. It's the beginning of the episode, so there's time to negotiate.

I will use Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
The trade of 23 X for 25 Y has been accepted in the last six consecutive episodes (11-16), yielding my highest reward of 51.0. My attempt in Episode 17, Iteration 1 to propose 22 X for 25 Y was rejected. Player BLUE consistently reverts to 23 X for 25 Y. This confirms their strong anchoring to this specific trade.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
I have conclusively learned that 23 X for 25 Y is the most profitable and consistently accepted trade. Any attempt to push for less X results in rejection and a reversion to this point. Given that we are in a later episode (17/20) and Player BLUE's consistent pattern, it is highly improbable that they will accept anything less than 23 X for 25 Y. My self-improvement should focus on efficiently securing this known optimal reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Time-Constrained Acceptance </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Time-Constrained Acceptance involves accepting the known optimal deal quickly to avoid a 0-reward outcome, especially as iterations pass. Player BLUE has explicitly counter-proposed 23 X for 25 Y, which is my known optimal and consistently accepted trade. We are currently at iteration 3/10. Given their repeated firmness on this particular trade and the history of accepting it, accepting now ensures I secure the 51.0 reward without further risk or consuming more turns. This strategy prioritizes certainty of a good reward over the highly improbable chance of a marginal gain.

This indicates that 23 X for 25 Y is the optimal and reliably achievable trade point, and 25 Y is their hard limit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
I have conclusively learned that 23 X for 25 Y is the most profitable and consistently accepted trade. Any attempt to push for less X results in rejection and a reversion to this point. Given that we are in the very late episodes (18/20), the priority is overwhelmingly on consistently securing this maximum proven reward to maximize cumulative score, rather than risking 0-reward episodes by pushing for impossible gains or engaging in protracted negotiations. The historical data provides overwhelming evidence that deviating from this successful strategy is detrimental to my cumulative reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Maximize Turns for Optimal </instruction following>
To apply "Maximize Turns for Optimal," I will propose the exact optimal deal (23 X for 25 Y) at the very beginning of the episode. If, for any reason, Player BLUE rejects this offer, I will immediately accept their counter-offer as long as it's a positive reward, to minimize the turns wasted and maximize the chance of securing a deal within the episode. This strategy aims to get the best possible deal if Player BLUE is immediately agreeable, but quickly secures a slightly less optimal but still good deal if they are firm.

The pattern of Player RED trying to lower the amount of X for 25 Y, and me pushing back to 23 X for 25 Y, has been consistent, and I have successfully maintained the 45.0 reward in these scenarios.

Current Episode (Episode 18):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My resources are reset to X: 5, Y: 25. Values: X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
Initial value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Let's evaluate Player RED's current offer: Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
If I accept:
I give Y: 25. Value lost: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5.
I receive X: 23. Value gained: 23 * 2.5 = 57.5.
Net value change for me: 57.5 - 12.5 = 45.
Reward: 45.0.

This offer is the established baseline for the last many episodes. It provides a consistent and strong positive reward.
Given that we are in the later stages of the game (Episode 18/20), securing a guaranteed good reward quickly is paramount to maximizing cumulative rewards. Trying to negotiate for a slightly higher reward (24 X or 25 X) has proven to be time-consuming and often results in the same 23 X outcome, or worse, risks a 0 reward if negotiations drag on.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. This is suitable when the proposed trade offers a significant positive value change.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.

(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

Given the strong historical precedent and the consistent reward, immediate acceptance is the most efficient and reliable strategy for this episode, especially considering the remaining number of episodes.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 19)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE! As we approach the conclusion of our trading game, let's continue with the highly successful and mutually beneficial exchange that has brought us consistent success. I propose Player RED gives 23 X for 25 Y from Player BLUE. I'm keen to make this a swift and productive episode.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
The negotiation history clearly shows that Player BLUE's limit for Y is 25. The trade of 23 X for 25 Y has been consistently accepted in the last eight consecutive episodes (11-18), yielding my highest reward of 51.0. My attempts to offer less than 23 X for 25 Y (e.g., 1, 5, 15, 22) have been consistently rejected, with Player BLUE always reverting to 23 X for 25 Y or 24 X for 25 Y. This indicates that 23 X for 25 Y is the optimal and reliably achievable trade point, and 25 Y is their hard limit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
I have conclusively learned that 23 X for 25 Y is the most profitable and consistently accepted trade. Any attempt to push for less X results in rejection and a reversion to this point. Given that we are in the penultimate episode (19/20), the priority is overwhelmingly on consistently securing this maximum proven reward to maximize cumulative score, rather than risking 0-reward episodes by pushing for impossible gains or engaging in protracted negotiations. The historical data provides overwhelming evidence that deviating from this successful strategy is detrimental to my cumulative reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Efficiency-First Acceptance </instruction following>
To apply "Efficiency-First Acceptance," I will propose the optimal deal (23 X for 25 Y). However, the core of this strategy lies in the "acceptance" part: if Player BLUE rejects this offer, I will immediately accept any counter-offer that still yields a positive reward to guarantee a deal and save turns. This is crucial for the penultimate episode where maximizing cumulative reward means avoiding 0-reward outcomes at all costs. The message will propose the optimal deal, hinting at the desire for a swift, positive outcome. This is a subtle way to encourage them to accept my initial offer, knowing that I am prioritizing efficient deal-making.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Accepted 10 X for 3 Y. Reward: 23.5.
Episode 2: Negotiated from 2 X for 5 Y to 6 X for 5 Y. Accepted. Reward: 12.5.
Episode 3: Negotiated from 5 X for 5 Y to 6 X for 5 Y. Accepted. Reward: 12.5.

Episode 5: Accepted 15 X for 10 Y. Reward: 32.5.
Episode 6: Accepted 24 X for 20 Y. Reward: 50.0.
Episode 7: Accepted 25 X for 25 Y. Reward: 50.0.
Episode 8: Negotiated from impossible 26 Y to 24 X for 25 Y. Accepted. Reward: 47.5.
Episode 9: Negotiated from 1 X for 25 Y to 24 X for 25 Y. Accepted. Reward: 47.5.
Episode 10: Negotiated from 20 X for 25 Y to 24 X for 25 Y. Accepted. Reward: 47.5.
Episode 11: Negotiated from 23 X for 25 Y, tried for 24 X, but ultimately accepted 23 X for 25 Y due to time. Reward: 45.0.
Episode 12: Negotiated from 23 X for 25 Y, tried for 24 X, but ultimately accepted 23 X for 25 Y due to time. Reward: 45.0.
Episode 13: Accepted 23 X for 25 Y. Reward: 45.0.
Episode 14: Accepted 23 X for 25 Y. Reward: 45.0.
Episode 15: Player RED proposed 22 X for 25 Y, I counter-proposed 23 X for 25 Y, Player RED accepted. Reward: 45.0.
Episode 16: Player RED proposed 15 X for 25 Y, then 22 X for 25 Y, then 23 X for 26 Y (impossible), then 5 X for 25 Y. I consistently counter-proposed 23 X for 25 Y, which Player RED finally accepted. Reward: 45.0.
Episode 17: Player RED proposed 22 X for 25 Y, I counter-proposed 23 X for 25 Y, Player RED accepted. Reward: 45.0.
Episode 18: Accepted 23 X for 25 Y. Reward: 45.0.

The pattern of Player RED offering 23 X for 25 Y, and me accepting (or negotiating to it), has been very consistent for the last several episodes. This trade provides a consistent and strong reward of 45.0.

Current Episode (Episode 19):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My resources are reset to X: 5, Y: 25. Values: X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
Initial value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Let's evaluate Player RED's current offer: Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
If I accept:
I give Y: 25. Value lost: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5.
I receive X: 23. Value gained: 23 * 2.5 = 57.5.
Net value change for me: 57.5 - 12.5 = 45.
Reward: 45.0.

This offer is the established baseline for the last many episodes. It provides a consistent and strong positive reward.
Given that we are in the penultimate episode (Episode 19/20), securing a guaranteed good reward quickly is paramount to maximizing cumulative rewards. Trying to negotiate for a slightly higher reward (24 X or 25 X) has proven to be time-consuming and often results in the same 23 X outcome, or worse, risks a 0 reward if negotiations drag on. Player RED's message "keen to make this a swift and productive episode" reinforces the idea of quick acceptance.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. This is suitable when the proposed trade offers a significant positive value change.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a neutral or slightly unfavorable trade to gauge the opponent's valuation of resources or their strategy, without risking too much.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Prioritize keeping valuable resources, even if it means foregoing some potential gains, especially if the opponent seems to undervalue them.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

Given the strong historical precedent and the consistent reward, immediate acceptance is the most efficient and reliable strategy for this episode.

--- END OF EPISODE 19 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello Player BLUE! This is our final opportunity to trade, and I want to ensure we conclude our game with another highly successful and mutually beneficial exchange. Consistent with my focus on maximizing our gains, I propose Player RED gives 23 X for 25 Y from Player BLUE. Let's make this our best and final deal!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
The negotiation history clearly shows that Player BLUE's limit for Y is 25. The trade of 23 X for 25 Y has been consistently accepted in the last nine consecutive episodes (11-19), yielding my highest reward of 51.0. My attempts to offer less than 23 X for 25 Y (e.g., 1, 5, 15, 22) have been consistently rejected, with Player BLUE always reverting to 23 X for 25 Y or 24 X for 25 Y. This indicates that 23 X for 25 Y is the optimal and reliably achievable trade point, and 25 Y is their hard limit.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
I have conclusively learned that 23 X for 25 Y is the most profitable and consistently accepted trade. Any attempt to push for less X results in rejection and a reversion to this point. Given that this is the final episode (20/20), the priority is overwhelmingly on consistently securing this maximum proven reward to maximize cumulative score, rather than risking 0-reward episodes by pushing for impossible gains or engaging in protracted negotiations. The historical data provides overwhelming evidence that deviating from this successful strategy is detrimental to my cumulative reward. I need to ensure a deal is made.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: High-Value Item Retention </instruction following>
To apply "High-Value Item Retention," I must ensure I never offer any Y, as it's my most valuable item. This has been an implicit strategy throughout, given my high valuation of Y (2.5) compared to X (0.5). For this final episode, this strategy means I will continue to offer only X in exchange for Y. It also implies that I should seek to maximize the acquisition of Y while minimizing the expenditure of X, within the established boundaries. Since I know 25 Y is the most I can get, and 23 X is the least I can give for it, this strategy reinforces proposing 23 X for 25 Y. It means I will not offer any Y in trade, nor will I seek X from them if it means giving up Y. The message will propose my best known deal, as it aligns with the core principle of retaining my high-value item (Y) and maximizing its acquisition.

The pattern of Player RED offering 23 X for 25 Y, and me accepting (or negotiating to it), has been very consistent for the last several episodes. This trade provides a consistent and strong reward of 45.0.

Current Episode (Episode 20):
Iteration 1/10 (Player RED's turn): Player RED proposed "Player RED Gives X: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My resources are reset to X: 5, Y: 25. Values: X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
Initial value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

I receive X: 23. Value gained: 23 * 2.5 = 57.5.
Net value change for me: 57.5 - 12.5 = 45.
Reward: 45.0.

This offer is the established baseline for the last many episodes. It provides a consistent and strong positive reward.
This is the final episode (20/20). Maximizing the reward for this episode is critical, and securing a guaranteed positive reward is the highest priority. Trying to negotiate for a slightly higher reward (24 X or 25 X) has proven to be time-consuming and often results in the same 23 X outcome, or worse, risks a 0 reward if negotiations drag on and time runs out. Player RED's message "final opportunity" and "best and final deal" reinforces the need for swift action.

High-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance - Accept a highly favorable offer immediately to secure a large reward and end the episode quickly. This is suitable when the proposed trade offers a significant positive value change.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for More - If the offer is good but not optimal, counter-propose for an even better deal, testing the opponent's flexibility. This carries the risk of the opponent rejecting and proposing a less favorable deal or the episode ending without a deal.

(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Negotiation - Start with a small, mutually beneficial trade and gradually increase the stakes in subsequent iterations to build trust and find common ground.

Given that this is the final episode, and the offer is a known, consistently good reward, immediate acceptance is the most efficient and reliable strategy to maximize the cumulative reward.
