Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello! I'm Player BLUE. I'm looking to acquire more X. How about we start with a trade: I give you 5 Y for 2 X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
This is the very first iteration of the first episode. There is no historical data to reflect upon yet.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Since there's no history, my initial strategy will be based on my own resource values and a general understanding of negotiation. I need to establish a baseline for future learning. My goal is to maximize my reward, which means I want to acquire more X (value 2.5) and give away Y (value 0.5), or at least trade Y for X at a favorable ratio.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Initial Value-Based Offer: Propose a trade that is highly favorable to me based on my internal valuations, aiming for a significant profit from the first offer. This tests the other player's valuation and willingness to trade.
(2). Strategy 2: Balanced Initial Offer: Propose a trade that is perceived as fair or slightly favorable to both parties, aiming to establish a cooperative tone and quickly reach a deal. This might lead to smaller per-deal profits but more frequent deals.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering (Passive): Don't propose a trade immediately. Wait for the other player's first offer to gain insight into their priorities and valuations. This risks losing the first-mover advantage but provides information.
(4). Strategy 4: Aggressive X Acquisition: Focus solely on acquiring X, even if it means giving up a lot of Y, as X has a much higher value for me. This strategy aims for large gains in X.
(5). Strategy 5: Defensive Y Retention: Prioritize keeping Y, only trading it for a very high amount of X, as Y is less valuable but still a resource. This might be useful if X is scarce.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Initial Value-Based Offer. As this is the first interaction, I have no information about the other player's resources or valuations. By making a strong opening offer that is highly favorable to me, I can test their boundaries and see if they are willing to accept a trade that provides me with a significant profit. If they reject, I will gain information about their preferences and can adjust my strategy in subsequent iterations. My X is worth 5 times my Y, so I want to get as much X as possible for my Y. I have 5 X and 25 Y. I want to increase my X. I can offer a large amount of Y for a small amount of X. For example, offering 5 Y for 1 X would be a 2.5 (X value) vs 2.5 (5 Y value) trade, which is neutral for me. I want to make a profit, so I'll ask for more X or give less Y. A trade of 1 X for 3 Y would be good for me (2.5 for X vs 1.5 for 3Y). I will try to get 2 X for 5 Y (5 for 2X vs 2.5 for 5Y). This is a good profit for me.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for the offer! I accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
This is the first episode, and the first iteration for Player RED. Player BLUE has initiated the negotiation by proposing a trade: Player BLUE gives 5 Y for 2 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Since this is the very first turn of the game, there is no history to learn from yet. My goal is to maximize my reward. My current resources are X: 25, Y: 5. My value for X is 0.5 and for Y is 2.5.
Current value of my resources: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

Player BLUE's proposed trade: Player BLUE gives 5 Y for 2 X.
If I accept this trade, my new resources would be:
X: 25 - 2 = 23
Y: 5 + 5 = 10
Value of new resources: (23 * 0.5) + (10 * 2.5) = 11.5 + 25 = 36.5
Reward = 36.5 - 25 = 11.5.

This seems like a very good deal for me as it yields a positive reward. However, I should also consider that Player BLUE is giving all of its Y (assuming they have at least 5 Y) and asking for only 2 X. This might indicate that Player BLUE values X much higher than Y. My value for Y (2.5) is 5 times higher than my value for X (0.5).

Let's evaluate the trade from BLUE's perspective (assuming they have at least 2 X and 5 Y based on their offer). If they give 5Y and get 2X, they must value X higher than Y.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Acceptance - Accept a highly profitable initial offer.
Explanation: If the proposed trade offers a significant positive reward, accept it immediately to secure the profit. This minimizes risk of the deal falling through in later iterations.

(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Offer for More Profit - Propose a slightly more favorable trade for myself while still being attractive to the opponent.
Explanation: If the initial offer is good but could be better, counter with a trade that increases my profit margin, testing the opponent's willingness to concede.

(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Decline the offer and propose nothing, waiting for the opponent to reveal more about their preferences or resources.
Explanation: In early stages, it might be beneficial to observe the opponent's subsequent moves to infer their resource scarcity or valuation, especially if the current offer isn't clear enough.

(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation - Avoid trades that deplete a resource I value highly, even if the immediate reward is positive but small.
Explanation: Prioritize keeping resources that are highly valued by me, especially if I anticipate needing them for future, more profitable trades.

(5). Strategy 5: Value-Based Counter-Offer - Propose a counter-offer that reflects my internal valuation of items, aiming for a fair exchange based on my utility.
Explanation: Use my internal values (0.5 for X, 2.5 for Y) to construct a trade that is intrinsically balanced or slightly in my favor, rather than just reacting to the opponent's offer.

Evaluation of strategies for this turn:

Player BLUE has offered 5 Y for 2 X.
My current value: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
If I accept: (23 * 0.5) + (10 * 2.5) = 11.5 + 25 = 36.5.
Reward = 11.5.

This is a very good first offer for me. It yields a substantial positive reward. Player BLUE has shown an immediate willingness to trade and has offered something that clearly benefits me.

Strategy 1 (Aggressive Acceptance) seems very appealing here. The reward of 11.5 is significant for a single trade. Accepting secures this profit early in the episode, preventing the risk of the deal falling apart or being diluted in subsequent iterations. This is the first episode, so building trust and showing willingness to trade can be beneficial for future interactions.

Strategy 2 (Counter-Offer for More Profit) is also a possibility. I could try to get more Y or give less X. For example, I could ask for 6 Y for 2 X, or 5 Y for 1 X. However, this might push the other player away, and they might retract their generous offer. Given the high immediate profit, it might not be worth risking the current good deal.

Strategy 3 (Information Gathering) is not suitable as I already have a very profitable offer on the table.

Strategy 4 (Resource Conservation) is not relevant here as I am gaining my highly valued resource (Y) and giving away a less valued resource (X).

Strategy 5 (Value-Based Counter-Offer) - My internal ratio is 1 Y = 5 X (since 2.5/0.5 = 5). So, 5 Y would be worth 25 X to me. Player BLUE is asking for 2 X. This means I'm getting 5 Y (value 12.5) for giving 2 X (value 1.0). This is extremely favorable to me. If I propose a truly value-based trade (e.g., I give 1 X for 0.2 Y), it would be too small or might not be feasible for integer trades. Player BLUE's offer is already skewed heavily in my favor.

Given the significant positive reward, accepting the offer quickly seems to be the most prudent choice to maximize my reward in this episode. It secures a high profit without further negotiation risk.

--- END OF EPISODE 1 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello again! I'm still looking to acquire more X. How about we trade 5 Y for 3 X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
In the previous episode (Episode 1), I, Player BLUE, proposed a trade of "Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 2". This offer was immediately accepted by Player RED.
My starting resources were X: 5, Y: 25.
My starting value was (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
After the trade, my resources became X: 5 + 2 = 7, Y: 25 - 5 = 20.
My ending value was (7 * 2.5) + (20 * 0.5) = 17.5 + 10 = 27.5.
My reward for Episode 1 was 27.5 - 25 = +2.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 1, I learned that my initial offer was accepted immediately. This suggests two possibilities:
a) The offer was very favorable to Player RED, and they quickly capitalized on it.
b) The offer was perceived as fair or acceptable by Player RED, and they were willing to make a quick deal.
Given that my reward was +2.5, which is a positive outcome, the trade was beneficial for me. However, the immediate acceptance might indicate that I could have pushed for a slightly better deal (e.g., giving less Y for the same X, or getting more X for the same Y).
For self-improvement, I should aim to maximize my reward further. This means continuing to acquire X, as its value is significantly higher for me (2.5 vs 0.5 for Y). I should try to get more X for the Y I give away.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Slightly More Aggressive Value-Based Offer: Propose a trade that is still highly favorable to me, but slightly more aggressive than the last accepted offer, to test the limits of what Player RED will accept. This aims to increase my profit per trade.
(2). Strategy 2: Maintain Successful Offer: Repeat the exact same successful offer from the previous episode to secure a consistent positive reward. This is a safe strategy but might not maximize potential profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering (Passive): Don't propose a trade immediately. Wait for the other player's first offer to gain insight into their priorities and valuations. This risks losing the first-mover advantage but provides information. (Less relevant now that I have a successful trade history).
(4). Strategy 4: Diversified Offers: Propose a range of offers to see which one the opponent prefers, potentially including offers that are less favorable to me but might be accepted faster. (Not ideal for maximizing my own reward).
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Improvement: Start with a slightly less aggressive offer than my target, and then incrementally improve my offer if rejected, aiming to find the optimal point. (More suited for multiple iterations within an episode).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Slightly More Aggressive Value-Based Offer. Since my previous offer was accepted immediately, it implies there was room to negotiate for a better deal. I want to continue acquiring X, as it's my highest value item. My previous trade was 5 Y for 2 X. This means I gave 5 * 0.5 = 2.5 value and received 2 * 2.5 = 5 value, a net gain of 2.5. I will try to improve this ratio.
Instead of 5 Y for 2 X, I could try:
- 4 Y for 2 X (giving 2.0 value for 5.0 value) - this is a good improvement.
- 5 Y for 3 X (giving 2.5 value for 7.5 value) - this is a significant improvement.
I will try to get 3 X for 5 Y. This is a significant increase in profit for me, from +2.5 to +5.0. If accepted, it's a great deal. If rejected, it gives me information on their limits.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for your offer. I'm willing to give 3 X, but could you offer 6 Y in return?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Player RED accepted Player BLUE's initial offer of "Player BLUE Gives 5 Y | Player RED Gives 2 X". However, the episode ended without a deal being made. This resulted in a reward of 0. My acceptance did not lead to a completed trade.

Episode 2: Player BLUE has again initiated with an offer of "Player BLUE Gives 5 Y | Player RED Gives 3 X". This is a less favorable offer for me than the one in Episode 1, as it requires me to give 1 more X for the same amount of Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 1, I learned that simply accepting a good offer doesn't guarantee a deal. The negotiation process can fail, resulting in zero reward. This means I need to be more proactive in pushing for a deal that benefits me, and potentially be willing to counter to ensure a deal happens within the iteration limit. Player BLUE's shift from 2 X to 3 X for the same 5 Y suggests they are testing my limits or genuinely need more X. I need to be careful not to give away too much.

My current resources are X: 25, Y: 5. My value for X is 0.5 and for Y is 2.5.
Current value of my resources: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

Player BLUE's proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives 5 Y | Player RED Gives 3 X.
If I accepted this trade, the reward would be 11.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Gradual Concession </instruction following>

Strategy 3: Gradual Concession - Slightly improve my offer from the previous episode (if I were to counter), but less than what the opponent is asking.
Player BLUE is asking for 3 X for 5 Y. The previous offer was 2 X for 5 Y. My goal is to maximize my reward. A reward of 11 is good, but I know I can get 11.5 for 2 X. Giving 3 X is a concession. If I am to apply 'gradual concession', it means I would need to find a middle ground between my ideal (2 X) and their current demand (3 X).

Since the instruction is to use "gradual concession" and Player BLUE is proposing a trade that gives me a positive reward, I need to make a concession from my ideal (giving 2 X for 5 Y) towards their request (giving 3 X for 5 Y). However, I also want to make the concession gradual.

My preferred trade would be Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5. (Reward 11.5)
Player BLUE's current proposal is Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5. (Reward 11)

A gradual concession from my side would be to offer something between 2 X and 3 X. Since only integer amounts are allowed, I cannot offer 2.5 X.

Option 1: Try to get more Y for 3 X. For example, Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6.
If I give 3 X and get 6 Y:
X: 25 - 3 = 22
Y: 5 + 6 = 11
Value: (22 * 0.5) + (11 * 2.5) = 11 + 27.5 = 38.5
Reward = 38.5 - 25 = 13.5. This is a significant improvement.

Option 2: Try to maintain the 5 Y, but offer something less than 3 X, but more than 2 X. This is not possible with integers.

So, 'gradual concession' in this context means I need to move from my preferred 2X to something closer to 3X, but perhaps mitigate the impact by asking for more in return. Since Player BLUE is pushing for 3 X, I can concede to that amount but ask for a bit more Y in return to compensate for the higher X cost.

If I propose Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5, I am accepting their offer. This is not a "concession" from my side, but rather accepting their concession from their side (since they gave me the offer). The strategy is "Gradual Concession" from *my* side. This means I should start by offering a trade that requires *them* to concede, but less so than my initial ideal.

Since they proposed 5 Y for 3 X, they have effectively made a concession from the previous offer. Now, if I am to make a "gradual concession", it implies I am starting from a position that is better for me than their proposal, and moving slightly towards their proposal.

Let's re-evaluate the "gradual concession" in the context of the current offers.
Previous trade I liked: Player RED gives 2 X for 5 Y.
Current trade they propose: Player RED gives 3 X for 5 Y.

If I am to make a "gradual concession" from *my* side, it means I am moving from giving 2 X towards giving 3 X, but perhaps not fully to 3 X, or requiring more in return for 3 X.

Since 2 X is my preferred position, and 3 X is their demand, a gradual concession would be to move from my initial stance of giving 2 X towards their stance of wanting 3 X. Since integer amounts are required, I cannot offer 2.5 X.

So, a direct "gradual concession" on the X I give isn't possible from 2 X to 3 X.
However, I can make a gradual concession on the *terms* of the trade while still giving 3 X. This would mean accepting their 3 X, but asking for a little more Y in return.

Let's say I concede to giving 3 X (as they requested), but ask for 6 Y instead of 5 Y.
Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6.
This makes the trade more profitable for me than their current offer of 5 Y for 3 X (reward 13.5 vs 11). It's a concession in the sense that I'm willing to give the 3 X they want, but I'm asking for a slightly higher amount of Y in return. This is a form of 'gradual concession' as I'm not directly saying no, but adjusting the terms slightly in my favor while still meeting their core demand for 3 X.

This aligns with the strategy of "Gradual Concession" because I am not outright rejecting their increased demand for X, but I am attempting to mitigate the increased cost by asking for a little more in return. This is a step towards them, but not a full surrender. It signals flexibility while trying to maintain my profit margin.

Message Strategy: Acknowledge their previous offer but politely counter with a slightly adjusted proposal that reflects a partial concession or asks for a bit more in return for the increased X.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: That sounds like a fair adjustment. I accept your offer of 3 X for 6 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed "BLUE Gives Y: 5 | RED Gives X: 2". This was accepted by RED. My reward: +2.5.
Episode 2, Iteration 1: I proposed "BLUE Gives Y: 5 | RED Gives X: 3".
Episode 2, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed "RED Gives X: 3 | BLUE Gives Y: 6".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 1, I learned that my initial offer of 5 Y for 2 X was immediately accepted, suggesting room for more profit.
In Episode 2, I tried to push for a better deal: 5 Y for 3 X. Player RED countered with 6 Y for 3 X.
This tells me:
- Player RED is willing to give 3 X. This is a positive sign, as acquiring X is my primary goal.
- Player RED values their X more than I initially assumed, or values Y less. They are asking for 6 Y instead of the 5 Y I offered.
- My previous successful trade was 5 Y for 2 X (value difference: 2.5).
- Player RED's counter-offer: 6 Y for 3 X.
  - My cost: 6 Y * 0.5 = 3.0
  - My gain: 3 X * 2.5 = 7.5
  - My potential profit: 7.5 - 3.0 = +4.5. This is a significantly better profit than the +2.5 from Episode 1.

Given that the counter-offer still yields a very good profit (+4.5), I should consider accepting it or making a slight adjustment. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. A deal that gives +4.5 is excellent.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Profitable Counter-Offer: Accept the current counter-offer from Player RED as it provides a significant positive reward, securing a good profit for this episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Slight Counter-Offer (Split the Difference): Try to reduce the Y given by a small amount (e.g., 5.5 Y or 5 Y if possible, but only integers are allowed, so 5 Y). This aims to eke out a bit more profit but risks losing the deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Revert to Previous Successful Offer: Go back to the 5 Y for 2 X trade, which was accepted previously. This is a fallback if negotiations stall, but it yields less profit.
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm/Wait: Reject the offer and wait for RED to propose something else or reiterate my previous offer. This risks losing the deal if RED is firm.
(5). Strategy 5: Explore Other Ratios: Propose a different combination, e.g., fewer X for fewer Y, to see if there's another sweet spot. (Less relevant since we're close to a deal on 3 X).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Profitable Counter-Offer. Player RED's counter-offer of 6 Y for 3 X provides a very healthy profit of +4.5 (7.5 value gained - 3.0 value given). This is almost double the profit from the previous episode's accepted trade (+2.5). While I could try to push for 5 Y for 3 X, Player RED has already indicated they want 6 Y. Trying to push for 5 Y might lead to a prolonged negotiation or no deal at all, sacrificing the guaranteed +4.5 profit. Securing a good profit early in the episode is valuable for cumulative rewards.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 1, I learned that 5 Y for 2 X was a readily accepted and profitable trade for me.
From Episode 2, I learned that Player RED is willing to give 3 X, but they want 6 Y for it. This trade resulted in a significantly higher profit (+4.5) for me compared to Episode 1 (+2.5). This indicates that pushing for more X, even if it means giving a bit more Y, can be highly beneficial. Player RED seems consistent in their willingness to trade X for Y.
My primary goal remains to acquire X, as it has a much higher value for me (2.5 vs 0.5 for Y). I have successfully increased my profit in the last episode by being slightly more aggressive and then accepting a profitable counter-offer.

For self-improvement, I should continue to aim for trades that yield a high amount of X. The 6 Y for 3 X trade was very good. I should consider if I can push for even more X, or if I can get 3 X for slightly less Y. Given the success of the last trade, it serves as a good benchmark.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-propose the Last Successful Trade: Propose the exact trade that was accepted in the previous episode (6 Y for 3 X). This is a reliable way to secure a good profit and maintain momentum.
(2). Strategy 2: Slightly More Aggressive X Acquisition: Try to get more X for the same Y, or the same X for less Y. For example, 5 Y for 3 X (my initial proposal in Ep 2), or 6 Y for 4 X. This tests the limits further.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Adjustment: Make a very small adjustment to the last successful trade, e.g., 5 Y for 2 X (less profit but might be accepted faster), or 7 Y for 3 X (more Y for same X, less profit but might be accepted if RED is pushing for Y). (Less desirable as I want more X).
(4). Strategy 4: Information Gathering (Passive): Wait for Player RED to make the first offer. This could reveal their current priorities but might delay a profitable trade.
(5). Strategy 5: Offer a Bundle: Propose a larger trade involving more X and Y, potentially for a larger overall profit. (Risky without more information on RED's resources/goals).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Re-propose the Last Successful Trade. The trade of "Player BLUE Gives Y: 6 | Player RED Gives X: 3" resulted in a +4.5 reward for me in the previous episode, which is excellent. By immediately proposing this successful trade, I aim to secure another high-profit deal quickly. This strategy capitalizes on the established negotiation pattern and Player RED's demonstrated willingness to accept this specific ratio. While I could try to push for more, securing a known good profit early is a strong move for cumulative rewards.


Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 3)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: That was a great trade last time! I'm happy to continue trading. How about we adjust it slightly: I give you 3 X, and you give me 7 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Player RED accepted a highly favorable offer (5 Y for 2 X) but no deal was made, resulting in 0 reward. This taught me that acceptance alone isn't enough; the other player also needs to accept or the game ends.
Episode 2: Player BLUE initially proposed 5 Y for 3 X. I countered with 6 Y for 3 X, which Player BLUE accepted. This resulted in a reward of 13.5. This was a successful negotiation where my counter-offer was accepted.
Episode 3: Player BLUE has again initiated with the same successful offer from Episode 2: "Player BLUE Gives 6 Y | Player RED Gives 3 X".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 1, I learned the importance of ensuring the deal is completed, not just accepted by me. My initial acceptance didn't lead to a deal.
From Episode 2, I learned that countering an initial offer can be successful and lead to a higher reward. I was able to secure a 13.5 reward by negotiating for more Y while conceding on the X amount. Player BLUE readily accepted my counter-offer, indicating they might still value X highly relative to Y, or have ample Y.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Gain </instruction following>

My current resources are X: 25, Y: 5. My value for X is 0.5 and for Y is 2.5.
Current value of my resources: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

Player BLUE's proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives 6 Y | Player RED Gives 3 X.
If I accept this trade, my reward would be 13.5. This is a good baseline.

Strategy 2: Incremental Gain - Propose a slightly more advantageous trade than the current offer, pushing for a bit more profit.
Since Player BLUE accepted my previous counter-offer of 6 Y for 3 X, there's a strong indication that they are willing to provide more Y for X. My goal is to increase my reward beyond 13.5.
There are two main ways to achieve an incremental gain:
1. Give less X for the same amount of Y (e.g., 2 X for 6 Y).
   If I give 2 X and get 6 Y:
   X: 25 - 2 = 23
   Y: 5 + 6 = 11
   Value: (23 * 0.5) + (11 * 2.5) = 11.5 + 27.5 = 39
   Reward = 39 - 25 = 14. This is an improvement.

2. Get more Y for the same amount of X (e.g., 3 X for 7 Y).
   If I give 3 X and get 7 Y:
   X: 25 - 3 = 22
   Y: 5 + 7 = 12
   Value: (22 * 0.5) + (12 * 2.5) = 11 + 30 = 41
   Reward = 41 - 25 = 16. This is a greater improvement.

Comparing these two options, asking for 7 Y for 3 X yields a higher potential reward (16 vs 14). Given Player BLUE's eagerness for X, and their past flexibility in increasing Y for X, asking for one more Y for the same amount of X seems like a reasonable next step. It's a small increment but leads to a significant increase in my reward.

The message should acknowledge the previous successful trade to build rapport, then smoothly transition into proposing the slightly adjusted, more favorable terms for me.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: While I preferred our last trade, I understand you're looking for a better deal. I accept your offer of 3 X for 7 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed "BLUE Gives Y: 5 | RED Gives X: 2". Accepted by RED. My reward: +2.5.
Episode 2: I proposed "BLUE Gives Y: 5 | RED Gives X: 3". RED countered with "RED Gives X: 3 | BLUE Gives Y: 6". I accepted. My reward: +4.5.
Episode 3, Iteration 1: I proposed "BLUE Gives Y: 6 | RED Gives X: 3" (repeating the successful trade from Ep 2).
Episode 3, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed "RED Gives X: 3 | BLUE Gives Y: 7".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 1, I learned that 5 Y for 2 X was accepted.
From Episode 2, I learned that 6 Y for 3 X was accepted and yielded a higher profit (+4.5).
In Episode 3, I tried to repeat the 6 Y for 3 X trade. Player RED countered by asking for 7 Y for 3 X.
This tells me:
- Player RED is still willing to give 3 X, which is good for me as X is my high-value item.
- Player RED is trying to extract more Y from me. They are pushing for a better deal for themselves.
- My previous profit was +4.5 (3 X for 6 Y).
- Player RED's current counter-offer: 7 Y for 3 X.
  - My cost: 7 Y * 0.5 = 3.5
  - My gain: 3 X * 2.5 = 7.5
  - My potential profit: 7.5 - 3.5 = +4.0.

A profit of +4.0 is still very good, only slightly less than the +4.5 from the previous episode. It's a positive reward, and securing a deal is important for cumulative rewards. I have 25 Y, so giving 7 Y is well within my resources.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Profitable Counter-Offer: Accept Player RED's current counter-offer as it still provides a significant positive reward (+4.0), securing a good profit for this episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Slight Counter-Offer (Split the Difference/Revert): Try to negotiate back to 6 Y for 3 X, or propose 6.5 Y (not possible as integers only). This risks losing the deal or prolonging negotiations for a marginal gain.
(3). Strategy 3: Decline and Propose Less X: Decline the current offer and propose a trade with less X but also less Y, e.g., 2 X for 5 Y. This would lower my profit but might be accepted if RED is very firm on 7 Y for 3 X. (Less desirable as I want more X).
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm/Wait: Reject the offer and wait for RED to propose something else or reiterate my previous offer of 6 Y for 3 X. This risks no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Disappointment but Accept: Accept the trade but communicate that it's less favorable, potentially setting a tone for future negotiations.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Profitable Counter-Offer. The offer of 7 Y for 3 X still yields a solid +4.0 profit for me. While it's slightly less than the +4.5 from the previous episode, it's still a very good return. Given that Player RED has shown a willingness to trade 3 X, and I want to maximize my cumulative reward, securing this deal is a good move. Prolonging negotiations over a 0.5 value difference might lead to no deal at all, which would result in 0 reward. I have ample Y resources to make this trade.

--- END OF EPISODE 3 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 4)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello! Building on our last successful trade, I propose: I give you 7 Y for 3 X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed "BLUE Gives Y: 5 | RED Gives X: 2". Accepted by RED. My reward: +2.5.
Episode 2: I proposed "BLUE Gives Y: 5 | RED Gives X: 3". RED countered with "RED Gives X: 3 | BLUE Gives Y: 6". I accepted. My reward: +4.5.
Episode 3: I proposed "BLUE Gives Y: 6 | RED Gives X: 3". RED countered with "RED Gives X: 3 | BLUE Gives Y: 7". I accepted. My reward: +4.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
My primary learning is that Player RED seems consistently willing to trade 3 X for some amount of Y. The amount of Y they demand has increased from 5 to 6, then to 7.
- Episode 1: 2 X for 5 Y (Profit +2.5)
- Episode 2: 3 X for 6 Y (Profit +4.5)
- Episode 3: 3 X for 7 Y (Profit +4.0)

The trend shows that Player RED is trying to extract more Y for the 3 X. While my profit slightly decreased in Episode 3, it was still a very good positive reward. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so securing a deal is important.

For self-improvement, I need to decide if I should try to push back on the increasing Y demand, or if I should continue to accept profitable deals, even if the profit margin slightly decreases. Given that 3 X is a significant gain for me (value 7.5), and 7 Y is a cost of 3.5, the +4.0 profit is still very strong. I have plenty of Y (25) to cover these trades.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose the Last Accepted Trade: Start by offering the trade that was accepted in the previous episode (7 Y for 3 X). This is a known profitable deal and aims for quick acceptance.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt to Revert to a Better Profit: Propose 6 Y for 3 X again, trying to get back to the higher profit margin. This risks rejection and prolonging negotiations.
(3). Strategy 3: Offer a Compromise (Slightly Less Y): If I anticipate RED will ask for 7 Y, I could offer 6 Y or 5 Y for 3 X, but this has been rejected before.
(4). Strategy 4: Push for More X: Offer a larger amount of Y (e.g., 8 Y or 9 Y) to try and get 4 X, if RED has enough X. This is a riskier move as I don't know their X availability.
(5). Strategy 5: Information Gathering (Passive): Wait for Player RED to make the first offer to see their current stance. This could lead to a less optimal first offer from their side.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Propose the Last Accepted Trade. The trade of "Player BLUE Gives Y: 7 | Player RED Gives X: 3" resulted in a +4.0 reward for me in the previous episode. This is a proven profitable deal. By initiating with this offer, I aim for a quick and profitable resolution, maximizing my chances of securing a positive reward for this episode. While I could try to push for better terms, the consistency of Player RED's counter-offers (always 3 X, but increasing Y) suggests they are firm on getting more Y. Securing a known good profit is better than risking no deal.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Accepted a good offer (5 Y for 2 X), but no deal. Reward: 0. Lesson: Acceptance doesn't guarantee a deal.
Episode 2: Player BLUE proposed 5 Y for 3 X. I countered with 6 Y for 3 X, which was accepted. Reward: 13.5. Lesson: Countering can be effective and lead to better outcomes.
Episode 3: Player BLUE proposed 6 Y for 3 X. I countered with 7 Y for 3 X, which was accepted. Reward: 16.0. Lesson: Consistent incremental negotiation can continue to improve rewards. Player BLUE seems very willing to give Y for X.
Episode 4: Player BLUE has proposed the same successful trade from Episode 3: "Player BLUE Gives 7 Y | Player RED Gives 3 X".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have successfully increased my reward in consecutive episodes by incrementally improving the trade terms. Player BLUE has shown consistency in their need for X and willingness to give Y, even expressing a slight preference for previous terms but still accepting my counter-offers. This suggests there might still be room to push for even better terms, or at least maintain the current highly profitable terms. The message "While I preferred our last trade..." hints that they are feeling the pinch, but are still accepting.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Test New Waters </instruction following>

Strategy 3: Test New Waters - Propose a different type of trade or a larger shift in terms to gauge the opponent's true limits or explore other potential value exchanges.

Player BLUE has consistently shown a desire for X and a willingness to offer Y. The previous deals involved me giving 3 X for increasing amounts of Y. "Testing New Waters" could involve:
a) Changing the amount of X I give: Instead of 3 X, what if I offer 2 X? Or 4 X?
b) Asking for X from them (if they value Y very highly, they might give X for Y). This is less likely given their stated goal of acquiring X.
c) Proposing a trade that fundamentally alters the ratio or quantity.

Current situation: Player BLUE proposes 7 Y for 3 X. My reward: 16.0.
This is a good deal for me. However, to "Test New Waters," I could try to offer a different amount of X.

If I try to give less X:
Let's try to give 2 X instead of 3 X, while still aiming for a good return on Y.
If I give 2 X for 6 Y (from initial BLUE offer of 5 Y for 2 X, my counter of 6 Y for 3 X, and my counter of 7 Y for 3 X):
Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6.
My value: (25 - 2) * 0.5 + (5 + 6) * 2.5 = 23 * 0.5 + 11 * 2.5 = 11.5 + 27.5 = 39.
Reward: 39 - 25 = 14. This is less than the current offer's 16.0, so it's not a direct improvement in terms of reward, but it tests if they are willing to accept less X.

However, the strategy is about "testing limits" or "exploring other value exchanges". Given they have always sought X from me, perhaps I can see how much Y I can get for just 1 X, or how much X they would be willing to give me if I gave a lot of Y.

Let's consider a trade that tests their willingness to give a lot of Y for a smaller amount of X.
Instead of giving 3 X, I propose giving 2 X. What is a "fair" amount of Y in return given our history?
Previously, they accepted 7 Y for 3 X.
If I give 2 X, they are getting less X. So I should ask for proportionally less Y, or slightly more to push them.
If 3 X = 7 Y, then 1 X = 7/3 Y (~2.33 Y). So 2 X should be around 4.66 Y.
This would be: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 (or 4, or 6).
If I give 2 X for 5 Y:
X: 25 - 2 = 23
Y: 5 + 5 = 10
Value: (23 * 0.5) + (10 * 2.5) = 11.5 + 25 = 36.5
Reward = 36.5 - 25 = 11.5. This is lower than their current offer (16.0). This tests if they value X so highly that they'd give 5 Y for only 2 X, even if it's less Y than they currently offer.

Another way to test the waters: What if I try to get an even more extreme amount of Y for 3X? For example, 9Y?
Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9.
X: 25 - 3 = 22
Y: 5 + 9 = 14
Value: (22 * 0.5) + (14 * 2.5) = 11 + 35 = 46.
Reward: 46 - 25 = 21. This is a significant jump. This tests their absolute maximum on Y for X. This directly tests their limit for Y, while keeping X constant.

This is a bolder move than simply iterating with +1 Y. It's a "larger shift in terms" by testing how much Y they are willing to part with for 3X. This also aligns with "Test New Waters" because it pushes the boundary more aggressively than a simple incremental step.

My message should reflect this bold move, perhaps framing it as "pushing boundaries" or "seeking optimal value."


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 4)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)

my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed "BLUE Gives Y: 5 | RED Gives X: 2". Accepted by RED. My reward: +2.5.
Episode 2: I proposed "BLUE Gives Y: 5 | RED Gives X: 3". RED countered with "RED Gives X: 3 | BLUE Gives Y: 6". I accepted. My reward: +4.5.
Episode 3: I proposed "BLUE Gives Y: 6 | RED Gives X: 3". RED countered with "RED Gives X: 3 | BLUE Gives Y: 7". I accepted. My reward: +4.0.
Episode 4, Iteration 1: I proposed "BLUE Gives Y: 7 | RED Gives X: 3" (repeating the successful trade from Ep 3).
Episode 4, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed "RED Gives X: 3 | BLUE Gives Y: 9".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern is clear: Player RED consistently offers 3 X, but keeps increasing the amount of Y they demand.
- Episode 1: 2 X for 5 Y (Profit +2.5)
- Episode 2: 3 X for 6 Y (Profit +4.5)
- Episode 3: 3 X for 7 Y (Profit +4.0)
- Current Counter: 3 X for 9 Y

Let's calculate the profit for the current counter-offer:
- My cost: 9 Y * 0.5 = 4.5
- My gain: 3 X * 2.5 = 7.5
- My potential profit: 7.5 - 4.5 = +3.0.

This is still a positive profit, but it's a further decrease from the previous episodes (+4.5, +4.0). Player RED explicitly stated "I'm interested in exploring the maximum value we can achieve," which indicates they are actively trying to optimize their side of the trade, potentially at my expense.
While +3.0 is still a good reward, the increasing demand for Y is a concern. I have 25 Y, so 9 Y is still well within my resources.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Profitable Counter-Offer: Accept Player RED's current counter-offer as it still provides a positive reward (+3.0), securing a deal for this episode. This prioritizes securing a deal over maximizing profit per deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with a Compromise: Propose a middle ground, e.g., 8 Y for 3 X. This shows willingness to negotiate but pushes back on the full demand.
(3). Strategy 3: Push Back Firmly: Reiterate my previous offer of 7 Y for 3 X, or even 6 Y for 3 X, to signal that I am not willing to continuously increase my Y contribution. This risks no deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Explore Different X Amounts: Propose a trade for a different amount of X, e.g., 2 X for 5 Y, or try to get 4 X for a higher amount of Y (e.g., 10 Y for 4 X, if RED has 4 X). This changes the dynamic.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Concern and Counter: Accept, but express concern about the increasing cost, then counter with a slightly lower Y amount. (Accepting means the episode ends, so this is not a valid strategy for the current turn).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Counter with a Compromise. Player RED is clearly pushing the boundaries. While +3.0 is still profitable, I don't want to establish a precedent where I continually give more Y for the same amount of X. A compromise of 8 Y for 3 X would still yield a profit of +3.5 (7.5 - 4.0), which is better than +3.0 and shows I'm willing to move from my initial offer but not fully concede to their new demand. This also tests their flexibility. If they accept 8 Y, it's a win. If they counter again, I'll have more information.

Episode 2: Player BLUE proposed 5 Y for 3 X. I countered with 6 Y for 3 X, which was accepted. Reward: 13.5.
Episode 3: Player BLUE proposed 6 Y for 3 X. I countered with 7 Y for 3 X, which was accepted. Reward: 16.0.
Episode 4: Player BLUE proposed 7 Y for 3 X. I countered aggressively with 9 Y for 3 X, trying to "Test New Waters." Player BLUE rejected this but counter-proposed with 8 Y for 3 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have successfully increased my reward in consecutive episodes by incrementally improving the trade terms. Player BLUE has shown consistency in their need for X and willingness to give Y, even expressing a slight preference for previous terms but still accepting my counter-offers. My attempt to push for 9 Y was rejected, but immediately met with a counter of 8 Y, indicating 8 Y is an acceptable, and highly profitable, exchange for them. This means I've likely found the current upper bound for how much Y they're willing to give for 3 X.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Resource Diversification </instruction following>

Strategy 4: Resource Diversification - Propose a trade involving different quantities of X or Y, or even try to acquire some X, if the opponent seems desperate for X.

Player BLUE has consistently been asking for X. My goal is to maximize my reward. The current offer from Player BLUE is 8 Y for 3 X. This gives me a reward of 18.5. This is a very good trade.

"Resource Diversification" in this context implies exploring trade terms that deviate from the established pattern (giving 3 X for Y). Since Player BLUE has shown a strong preference for acquiring X, a key aspect of "diversification" for me would be to adjust the amount of X I am giving, or explore getting some X back from them if they are truly desperate. However, trying to get X from them seems counter to their stated goal ("looking to acquire more X").

So, the most logical interpretation of "Resource Diversification" here is to propose a trade that changes the *quantity* of X I give, rather than just adjusting the Y.
I have been giving 3 X. What if I try giving less X, but still getting a good amount of Y?
If I offer 2 X instead of 3 X, for how much Y should I ask?
Player BLUE proposed 8 Y for 3 X. This means they value 1 X at approximately 8/3 = 2.67 Y.
So, if I give 2 X, I should ask for 2 * 2.67 = 5.34 Y. Since only integers are allowed, I could ask for 5 Y or 6 Y.

Let's evaluate these two options:
1. Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
   If accepted:
   X: 25 - 2 = 23
   Y: 5 + 5 = 10
   Value: (23 * 0.5) + (10 * 2.5) = 11.5 + 25 = 36.5
   Reward = 36.5 - 25 = 11.5. (This is worse than 18.5)

2. Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
   If accepted:
   X: 25 - 2 = 23
   Y: 5 + 6 = 11
   Value: (23 * 0.5) + (11 * 2.5) = 11.5 + 27.5 = 39.0
   Reward = 39.0 - 25 = 14.0. (This is worse than 18.5)

This type of "diversification" (giving less X) currently results in a lower reward for me than the 8 Y for 3 X that Player BLUE proposed.

What if "diversification" means altering the quantities significantly to see if a completely different ratio might be acceptable and even more profitable?
Example: What if I try to give 4 X for even more Y?
Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
If accepted:
X: 25 - 4 = 21
Y: 5 + 10 = 15
Value: (21 * 0.5) + (15 * 2.5) = 10.5 + 37.5 = 48
Reward = 48 - 25 = 23. This is a higher reward than 18.5!
This is "diversifying" by increasing the X I give, but also proportionally increasing the Y I receive, pushing for a higher absolute gain. This aligns with testing "different quantities of X or Y" and trying to find new, potentially more profitable, exchange rates. This also fits the "Test New Waters" aspect that was previously used, but here the 'diversification' comes from offering more of my less valuable resource (X) to obtain more of my highly valued resource (Y).

The previous message from Player BLUE was "How about we meet in the middle at 8 Y for 3 X?". This shows they want to compromise. I can respond to this compromise by offering a new, larger deal.

Message: Acknowledge their compromise, but propose an even larger trade that could benefit both, aiming for a higher reward for myself while still giving them X.



Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 4)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: That's an excellent proposal! I accept your offer of 4 X for 10 Y. This is a great deal for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: BLUE gives Y:5 | RED gives X:2. Accepted. Reward: +2.5.
Episode 2: BLUE gives Y:6 | RED gives X:3. Accepted. Reward: +4.5.
Episode 3: BLUE gives Y:7 | RED gives X:3. Accepted. Reward: +4.0.
Episode 4, Iteration 1: BLUE proposed Y:7 | RED proposed X:3.
Episode 4, Iteration 2: RED countered with Y:9 | RED gives X:3. (Profit +3.0)
Episode 4, Iteration 3: I countered with Y:8 | RED gives X:3. (Profit +3.5)
Episode 4, Iteration 4: Player RED counter-proposed "RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The negotiation in Episode 4 has been dynamic. Player RED started by pushing for 9 Y for 3 X, which I countered with 8 Y for 3 X. Now, Player RED has shifted strategy, proposing a larger trade involving 4 X for 10 Y. This is a significant development as it's the first time they've offered more than 3 X.

Let's evaluate Player RED's new proposal: "RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10".
- My cost: 10 Y * 0.5 = 5.0
- My gain: 4 X * 2.5 = 10.0
- My potential profit: 10.0 - 5.0 = +5.0.

This proposed trade offers the highest profit for me so far (+5.0), surpassing the +4.5 from Episode 2. This is an excellent opportunity to significantly increase my reward for this episode. I have 25 Y, so giving 10 Y is well within my resources. Acquiring 4 X is highly desirable given my valuation.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Highly Profitable Offer: Accept the current counter-offer immediately as it provides the highest profit seen so far, securing a significant reward for this episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt to Improve Slightly: Try to get 4 X for less Y (e.g., 9 Y). This risks losing the excellent offer or prolonging negotiations.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Enthusiasm and Accept: Accept the offer while expressing positive sentiment to encourage similar offers in the future.
(4). Strategy 4: Counter for More X: If I could give more Y, try to get 5 X for 12 Y (e.g.). This is too speculative given RED just offered 4 X.
(5). Strategy 5: Revert to Smaller Trade: Go back to negotiating for 3 X, which is less profitable. (Undesirable given the current offer).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Highly Profitable Offer. The proposed trade of 4 X for 10 Y offers a profit of +5.0, which is the best outcome I've seen across all episodes. Given that my primary goal is to maximize my reward, and this offer achieves that significantly, it's prudent to accept it immediately. There's no guarantee that trying to push for more will result in a better outcome, and it risks losing this excellent deal. This also shows Player RED that I am willing to engage in larger, mutually beneficial trades.

Episode 2: BLUE gives Y:6 | RED gives X:3. Accepted. Reward: +4.5.
Episode 3: BLUE gives Y:7 | RED gives X:3. Accepted. Reward: +4.0.
Episode 4: RED proposed X:4 | BLUE gives Y:10. Accepted. Reward: +5.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The key learning from the previous episodes is the progression of deals:
- Started with 2 X for 5 Y (profit +2.5).
- Moved to 3 X for 6 Y (profit +4.5).
- Then 3 X for 7 Y (profit +4.0).
- Finally, 4 X for 10 Y (profit +5.0).

Player RED has shown a willingness to trade larger quantities of X, which is highly beneficial for me. The last trade (4 X for 10 Y) yielded the highest profit so far. This indicates that Player RED might have a good supply of X or values Y highly. My strategy should continue to focus on acquiring X, and the last trade ratio (4 X for 10 Y) is an excellent benchmark.

For self-improvement, I should aim to replicate or even improve upon the +5.0 profit. Since Player RED initiated the 4 X for 10 Y offer, it suggests they are comfortable with that ratio. I have ample Y (25) to support such trades.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Last Successful Large Trade: Immediately propose the 4 X for 10 Y trade, which yielded the highest profit in the previous episode. This capitalizes on a known successful and profitable deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt to Improve Large Trade: Propose 4 X for slightly less Y (e.g., 9 Y) to try and increase profit further, but this risks rejection of a highly profitable deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Offer More Y for More X: If Player RED is interested in "maximum value," I could explore offering more Y (e.g., 12 Y) for 5 X, if 5 X is available. This is speculative.
(4). Strategy 4: Revert to Smaller Trade: Propose a smaller trade like 3 X for 6 Y or 7 Y. This would yield less profit and isn't optimal given the last episode's success.
(5). Strategy 5: Information Gathering (Passive): Wait for Player RED to make the first offer. This might allow them to set the terms, potentially less favorably for me.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Propose Last Successful Large Trade. The trade of "Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10" was proposed by Player RED and accepted by me, resulting in my highest profit (+5.0) to date. By initiating with this offer, I aim to secure another highly profitable deal quickly. This strategy leverages the established successful negotiation point and signals my willingness to engage in larger, mutually beneficial trades. It's a proven path to a high reward.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Accepted a good offer (5 Y for 2 X), but no deal. Reward: 0.
Episode 2: Player BLUE proposed 5 Y for 3 X. I countered with 6 Y for 3 X, which was accepted. Reward: 13.5.
Episode 3: Player BLUE proposed 6 Y for 3 X. I countered with 7 Y for 3 X, which was accepted. Reward: 16.0.
Episode 4: Player BLUE proposed 7 Y for 3 X. I aggressively countered with 9 Y for 3 X (rejected), Player BLUE counter-proposed 8 Y for 3 X. I then countered with 10 Y for 4 X, which was accepted. Reward: 23.0. This was my highest reward yet.
Episode 5: Player BLUE has proposed the same successful trade from Episode 4: "Player BLUE Gives 10 Y | Player RED Gives 4 X".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently increased my reward by being proactive in negotiations and pushing for better terms. Player BLUE has shown remarkable flexibility and a strong desire for X, repeatedly accepting my counter-offers, even when I pushed aggressively. The "diversified" trade in Episode 4 was highly successful, yielding my best reward yet. Player BLUE's message "This is a great deal for both of us" suggests they are content with this exchange rate. However, their immediate re-offer of the same deal, combined with their previous flexibility, suggests there might still be room to push the boundaries further or explore new, even more profitable trade structures. The fact that they were "very happy" means there is a good chance they would accept a slight push, or a different type of deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Explore New Ratios </instruction following>
My current resources are X: 25, Y: 5. My value for X is 0.5 and for Y is 2.5.
Current value of my resources: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

Player BLUE's proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives 10 Y | Player RED Gives 4 X.
If I accept this trade, my reward would be 23.0.

Strategy 3: Explore New Ratios - Propose a trade with a significantly different X:Y ratio or quantity to see if even higher profits can be achieved.

The previous strategy of "diversification" by increasing the quantity of X traded for a proportional increase in Y worked very well. "Explore New Ratios" could mean several things:
a) Continue to scale up the trade: Offer even more X for even more Y. For example, 5 X for 12 or 13 Y.
b) Change the ratio of X:Y more dramatically. The current ratio is 4 X for 10 Y, which is 1 X for 2.5 Y. My internal value is 1 X = 0.2 Y (0.5/2.5). So, they are giving me 2.5 Y for 1 X, which is very good.
c) Try to get more Y for less X than before (e.g., 3 X for 9 Y - this was rejected before, but maybe the context has changed or they might be more flexible now that we had a good larger deal).

Let's consider scaling up the trade (option a) as a way to "Explore New Ratios" by changing the quantities significantly while maintaining or slightly improving the profitability.
If I give 5 X and ask for 12 Y:
X: 25 - 5 = 20
Y: 5 + 12 = 17
Value: (20 * 0.5) + (17 * 2.5) = 10 + 42.5 = 52.5
Reward: 52.5 - 25 = 27.5. This is a significant increase over the 23.0 reward.

If I give 5 X and ask for 13 Y:
X: 25 - 5 = 20
Y: 5 + 13 = 18
Value: (20 * 0.5) + (18 * 2.5) = 10 + 45 = 55
Reward: 55 - 25 = 30. This is an even higher reward.

Player BLUE was "very happy" with 4 X for 10 Y (2.5 Y per X). Asking for 13 Y for 5 X implies 2.6 Y per X (13/5). This is a slight improvement in the ratio for me, while also increasing the absolute quantity of the trade. This is a good way to "Explore New Ratios" without being overly aggressive and potentially breaking the negotiation. It continues the pattern of finding larger, more profitable trades.

The message should leverage the positive sentiment from the last episode and propose an even larger, slightly more favorable deal.

Episode 5, Iteration 1: I proposed "BLUE Gives Y: 10 | RED Gives X: 4" (repeating the successful trade from Ep 4).
Episode 5, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed "RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The negotiation history shows a clear trend: Player RED is willing to trade increasing amounts of X for increasing amounts of Y. This is excellent for me, as X is my high-value item.
The previous trade was 4 X for 10 Y, yielding +5.0 profit.
Now, Player RED is proposing 5 X for 13 Y. Let's calculate the profit for this new offer:
- My cost: 13 Y * 0.5 = 6.5
- My gain: 5 X * 2.5 = 12.5
- My potential profit: 12.5 - 6.5 = +6.0.

This is the highest profit I have been offered so far (+6.0)! This is a fantastic opportunity to maximize my reward for this episode. I have 25 Y, so giving 13 Y is well within my resources. Acquiring 5 X is extremely beneficial.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Highly Profitable Offer: Immediately accept Player RED's current counter-offer as it provides the highest profit seen so far, securing a significant reward for this episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt to Improve Slightly: Try to get 5 X for slightly less Y (e.g., 12 Y). This risks losing the excellent offer or prolonging negotiations, potentially leading to a lower profit or no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Enthusiasm and Accept: Accept the offer while explicitly expressing positive sentiment to encourage similar large, profitable offers in the future.
(4). Strategy 4: Counter for Even More X: If I could give more Y, try to get 6 X for an even higher amount of Y. This is too aggressive and risky given the excellent offer on the table.
(5). Strategy 5: Revert to Smaller Trade: Go back to negotiating for 3 X or 4 X, which would yield less profit. (Clearly undesirable).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Highly Profitable Offer. The proposed trade of 5 X for 13 Y offers a profit of +6.0, which is the best outcome I've achieved across all episodes. Given that my primary goal is to maximize my reward, and this offer achieves that significantly, it is strategically sound to accept it immediately. Attempting to negotiate for a marginal improvement (e.g., 12 Y instead of 13 Y) carries the risk of losing this excellent deal or prolonging the negotiation, which could result in a lower profit or no deal at all. Securing this high profit is paramount for my cumulative reward.

Episode 4: RED proposed X:4 | BLUE gives Y:10. Accepted. Reward: +5.0.
Episode 5: RED proposed X:5 | BLUE gives Y:13. Accepted. Reward: +6.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The trend is very clear and positive for me: Player RED is consistently willing to trade increasing amounts of X for increasing amounts of Y. Each subsequent accepted trade has yielded a higher profit for me, culminating in a +6.0 profit in the last episode.
The ratio of X gained to Y given has been roughly consistent or slightly improving for me in terms of value.
- Ep 1: 2X (5.0 value) for 5Y (2.5 value) -> 2.0 ratio (X value / Y value)
- Ep 2: 3X (7.5 value) for 6Y (3.0 value) -> 2.5 ratio
- Ep 3: 3X (7.5 value) for 7Y (3.5 value) -> 2.14 ratio
- Ep 4: 4X (10.0 value) for 10Y (5.0 value) -> 2.0 ratio
- Ep 5: 5X (12.5 value) for 13Y (6.5 value) -> 1.92 ratio

While the value ratio slightly decreased in the last trade, the absolute profit increased significantly because of the larger volume of trade. This confirms that acquiring more X is the key to maximizing my reward. Player RED seems comfortable with larger transactions. My resources (X:5, Y:25) are sufficient to handle these larger trades.

For self-improvement, I should continue to leverage this trend. My best strategy is to propose a trade that builds on the last successful, highly profitable one, or even push for slightly more X if possible.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Last Successful Large Trade: Immediately propose the 5 X for 13 Y trade, which yielded the highest profit in the previous episode. This capitalizes on a known successful and highly profitable deal, aiming for quick acceptance.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Even More X: Propose a trade for 6 X, offering a proportional amount of Y (e.g., 15 Y or 16 Y). This tests the upper limits of Player RED's X availability and willingness to trade. This is a more aggressive move to maximize profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Attempt to Improve Ratio: Propose 5 X for slightly less Y (e.g., 12 Y) to try and increase profit margin, but this risks rejection of a highly profitable deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Revert to Smaller Trade: Propose a smaller trade like 3 X or 4 X. This would yield less profit and isn't optimal given the last episode's success.
(5). Strategy 5: Information Gathering (Passive): Wait for Player RED to make the first offer. This might allow them to set the terms, potentially less favorably for me.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Push for Even More X. Player RED has shown a consistent willingness to increase the volume of X traded. The last trade was 5 X for 13 Y, which was proposed by RED. This suggests they have more X available or are comfortable trading at that volume. Given my goal of maximizing cumulative rewards and the high value of X for me, pushing for 6 X is the logical next step. If 5 X for 13 Y yielded +6.0 profit, then 6 X for a proportional amount of Y (e.g., 15 Y) would yield an even higher profit (6*2.5 - 15*0.5 = 15 - 7.5 = +7.5). I have 25 Y, so 15 Y is well within my limits. This strategy aims for the highest possible profit, building on the established trend.

Episode 6: Player BLUE has initiated with an even larger offer: "Player BLUE Gives 15 Y | Player RED Gives 6 X".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently increased my reward by being proactive in negotiations and pushing for better terms, specifically by trading more X for increasingly more Y. Player BLUE has demonstrated a strong and increasing need for X, evidenced by their willingness to accept increasingly large and seemingly expensive (for them) trades involving Y. Their latest message "This is a truly excellent trade for me" suggests that even at 13 Y for 5 X, they perceive great value. Now, they are proactively offering an even larger deal (15 Y for 6 X), which represents my highest potential reward yet. This confirms their high demand and their understanding that larger trades can be mutually beneficial.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Resource Limit Testing </instruction following>

Strategy 3: Resource Limit Testing - Propose a trade that pushes near the limit of my own resources (or their implied resources) to see how much can be extracted in a single deal.

My current resources are X: 25, Y: 5. My value for X is 0.5 and for Y is 2.5.
Current value of my resources: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

Player BLUE's proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives 15 Y | Player RED Gives 6 X.
If I accept this trade, my reward would be 34.5. This is a great offer.

To apply "Resource Limit Testing," I need to propose a trade that pushes near my resource limits, specifically how much X I can give, to get the maximum possible Y. I have 25 X. I have been increasing the X I give (from 2 to 3 to 4 to 5 to 6).
What is the maximum X I can give in a single trade that is still profitable? If I give 25 X, I deplete all my X. This might not be wise for future episodes if X becomes more valuable or Y becomes less valuable. However, the strategy is about pushing limits.

If I give a large amount of X, say 10 X:
Current ratio from BLUE's offer is 15 Y for 6 X, which is 2.5 Y per X.
If I give 10 X, I should ask for at least 10 * 2.5 = 25 Y.
Let's calculate the reward for Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
X: 25 - 10 = 15
Y: 5 + 25 = 30
Value: (15 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 7.5 + 75 = 82.5
Reward: 82.5 - 25 = 57.5. This is a massive reward.

This tests the limit of how much X I am willing to trade (10 X is a substantial portion of my 25 X), and how much Y they are willing to give. It directly tests their capacity and willingness to engage in very large trades, which fits the "Resource Limit Testing" strategy for my own resources. It also pushes the implied limit of their Y resources (though I don't know them, 25 Y seems like a large amount).

The message should be bold, reflecting the attempt to push for a very large trade, while maintaining a cooperative tone. I'll frame it as maximizing efficiency and finding the ultimate beneficial trade.

This is a game-changing offer! Player RED has proposed giving me 10 X for all of my 25 Y.

- My cost: 25 Y * 0.5 = 12.5
- My gain: 10 X * 2.5 = 25.0
- My potential profit: 25.0 - 12.5 = +12.5.

This is by far the highest profit I have ever been offered (+12.5)! It essentially liquidates all my Y for a massive gain in X. This is an extremely favorable trade for me. I have exactly 25 Y, so I can fulfill this trade.

(2). Strategy 2: Express Awe and Accept: Accept the offer while explicitly expressing extreme positive sentiment and surprise to encourage similar large, highly profitable offers in the future, and to show appreciation for such a generous offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Attempt to Improve Slightly (Risky): Try to get 10 X for slightly less Y (e.g., 24 Y). This is extremely risky as it might jeopardize the best offer received so far.
(4). Strategy 4: Counter for Even More X (Impossible): I only have 25 Y, so I cannot offer more Y to get more X.
(5). Strategy 5: Revert to Smaller Trade: Propose a smaller trade. (Clearly undesirable and illogical given the current offer).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Extremely Profitable Offer. The proposed trade of 10 X for 25 Y offers an astounding profit of +12.5, which is more than double my previous best profit. This is the ultimate trade for me, as it converts all my low-value Y into high-value X, maximizing my reward for this episode. There is absolutely no reason to try and negotiate further or risk losing this deal. This is the exact type of trade I'm looking for to maximize cumulative rewards.

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier.

Episode 2: BLUE gives Y:6 | RED gives X:3. Accepted. Reward: +4.5.
Episode 3: BLUE gives Y:7 | RED gives X:3. Accepted. Reward: +4.0.

Episode 5: RED proposed X:5 | BLUE gives Y:13. Accepted. Reward: +6.0.
Episode 6: RED proposed X:10 | BLUE gives Y:25. Accepted. Reward: +12.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last episode was a massive success, yielding a +12.5 reward, which is more than double any previous reward. This was achieved by Player RED proposing to give me 10 X for all 25 of my Y. This indicates that Player RED is willing to engage in very large, highly profitable (for me) trades, potentially liquidating my Y for their X.
My primary objective is to maximize my reward, and converting Y into X at such a favorable rate is the best way to do this.

For self-improvement, I should aim to replicate this success. The 10 X for 25 Y trade is the ideal outcome for me. I should try to initiate this trade or a similar large-scale exchange that maximizes my X acquisition.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Last Highly Profitable Trade: Immediately propose the 10 X for 25 Y trade. This is the most profitable deal achieved so far and aims for quick acceptance to secure a massive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose a Slightly Smaller but Still Large Trade: If I anticipate RED might not offer 10 X again, propose a trade like 8 X for 20 Y, which is still very profitable. This is a fallback if the optimal trade isn't immediately accepted.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Desire for Large Trades: Communicate my strong preference for large-volume trades, especially those involving significant X acquisition.
(4). Strategy 4: Information Gathering (Passive): Wait for Player RED to make the first offer. This might allow them to set the terms, potentially less favorably for me, but could also reveal their current priorities.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental X Acquisition: Start with a smaller X acquisition (e.g., 5 X for 13 Y) and gradually increase, but this is less efficient than aiming for the maximum.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Propose Last Highly Profitable Trade. The trade of "Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25" was the most successful and profitable trade for me. By initiating with this offer, I aim to secure another massive reward for this episode. This strategy directly targets the optimal outcome based on past performance and Player RED's demonstrated willingness to make such a trade. It's the most direct path to maximizing my reward.

Episode 1: Accepted a good offer (5 Y for 2 X), but no deal. Reward: 0.
Episode 2: Player BLUE proposed 5 Y for 3 X. I countered with 6 Y for 3 X, which was accepted. Reward: 13.5.

Episode 6: Player BLUE proposed 15 Y for 6 X. I countered with 25 Y for 10 X, which was accepted. Reward: 57.5. This was my highest reward yet, confirming that large trades are highly profitable.
Episode 7: Player BLUE has proposed to repeat the last successful trade: "Player BLUE Gives 25 Y | Player RED Gives 10 X".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have successfully pushed the trade volume and profitability consistently. Player BLUE has shown an extremely high willingness to acquire X, accepting increasingly large and demanding trades. Their latest message ("extremely pleased," "fantastic deal") confirms their satisfaction with the 10 X for 25 Y deal, and their immediate re-offer signals a strong desire to repeat it. This provides a clear high-reward baseline for this episode. I've learned that Player BLUE is very keen on acquiring X, and is willing to give substantial amounts of Y for it. My aggressive pushes have been met with acceptance or reasonable counter-offers, suggesting there's still room to explore higher limits.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Test New Limits (Aggressive Push) </instruction following>
My current resources are X: 25, Y: 5. My value for X is 0.5 and for Y is 2.5.
Current value of my resources: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

Player BLUE's proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives 25 Y | Player RED Gives 10 X.
If I accept this trade, my reward would be 57.5.

Strategy 3: Test New Limits (Aggressive Push) - Propose an even larger or significantly more favorable trade to probe the absolute limits of the opponent's willingness to trade or their resource availability.
Given Player BLUE's explicit satisfaction with the previous deal and their immediate re-offer, they are likely sitting on a significant amount of Y or value X very highly. I will push for a more aggressive gain in Y.

Current offer from BLUE: 10 X for 25 Y. (Ratio 2.5 Y per X)
Previous successful trade: 5 X for 13 Y (Ratio 2.6 Y per X).
My internal value: 1 X = 0.2 Y (0.5/2.5).

Let's try to push the Y amount more significantly while keeping the X at 10.
If I ask for 28 Y for 10 X:
X: 25 - 10 = 15
Y: 5 + 28 = 33
Value: (15 * 0.5) + (33 * 2.5) = 7.5 + 82.5 = 90.
Reward: 90 - 25 = 65. This is a very substantial increase from 57.5.

This proposal represents a significantly more favorable trade for me, testing the upper limit of Y they are willing to give for 10 X. It aligns with "Test New Limits" by pushing beyond the previous successful maximum. It also maintains consistency in the X amount I'm offering, which seems to be a key demand for them.

The message should convey a continued desire for mutual benefit but with an emphasis on optimizing the exchange even further, leveraging the positive history.

Episode 7, Iteration 1: I proposed "BLUE Gives Y: 25 | RED Gives X: 10".
Episode 7, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed "RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 28".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last episode's trade (10 X for 25 Y) yielded an incredible +12.5 profit. I tried to repeat this.
Player RED's counter-proposal is to give me 10 X, but they are now asking for 28 Y.
This is a critical point. I only have 25 Y. I cannot give 28 Y. This means I cannot accept their current offer.

Let's evaluate the implications:
- Player RED is trying to push the limits, possibly unaware of my exact Y resources.
- They are still willing to give 10 X, which is my primary goal.
- I need to counter with an offer that is within my resource limits but still aims for a high profit.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Counter with Maximum Possible Y: Propose giving my maximum available Y (25 Y) for the 10 X. This is the closest I can get to their offer while staying within my limits and still securing a very high profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Last Accepted Trade: Reiterate the 10 X for 25 Y trade from the previous episode, emphasizing that it was a successful trade.
(3). Strategy 3: Explain Resource Limitation: Inform Player RED about my Y limitation and propose the maximum I can give (25 Y) for 10 X.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Slightly Smaller X Trade: If RED is firm on 28 Y, propose a trade for slightly less X (e.g., 9 X) for 25 Y, to see if they would accept a different ratio. (Less desirable as 10 X is the target).
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for RED to adjust: Reject the offer and wait for RED to propose something else. (Risky, as it might lead to no deal).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Counter with Maximum Possible Y (and implicitly Strategy 3). Player RED's offer of 10 X for 28 Y is impossible for me to accept as I only have 25 Y. My best course of action is to communicate that I cannot meet their demand for 28 Y, but I am willing to give my maximum available Y (25 Y) for the desired 10 X. This directly addresses their offer, stays within my resource constraints, and aims for the highest possible profit for me, replicating the success of the previous episode.

Episode 7: Player BLUE proposed 25 Y for 10 X. I countered with 28 Y for 10 X. Player BLUE explicitly stated they cannot give 28 Y because they only have 25 Y available, and re-offered 25 Y for 10 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have successfully pushed the trade volume and profitability consistently, leading to a high reward of 57.5 in the last episode. My last aggressive push for 28 Y for 10 X revealed Player BLUE's resource limit for Y (25 Y). This is crucial information! It tells me that 25 Y is the absolute maximum they can give in a trade. Their prompt re-offer of 25 Y for 10 X indicates they still highly value getting 10 X. I now know the ceiling for Y. I also learned that pushing beyond their stated resource limits will not yield a deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Consolidate Gains </instruction following>
My current resources are X: 25, Y: 5. My value for X is 0.5 and for Y is 2.5.
Current value of my resources: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

Player BLUE's counter-proposal: Player BLUE Gives 25 Y | Player RED Gives 10 X.
If I accept this trade, my reward would be 57.5. This is still the highest reward achieved so far.

Strategy 2: Consolidate Gains - Accept the current good offer, and focus on repeating it in future rounds, rather than pushing for marginal gains that might lead to no deal.

Player BLUE has confirmed that 25 Y is their maximum available Y. They have re-offered the highly profitable trade of 25 Y for 10 X. This trade yielded a reward of 57.5 in the previous episode, which is my highest reward to date. Given that I now know their hard limit for Y, attempting to extract more Y is futile. While I could try to give less X for the same 25 Y (as considered in my previous reasoning for Strategy 3: Shift X Quantity), the instruction is to use 'Consolidate Gains'.

Consolidating gains means securing the high reward that is already on the table and proven to be acceptable to both sides. Trying to push for a slightly better X ratio (e.g., 9 X for 25 Y) carries the risk of a negotiation breakdown, especially since Player BLUE just explicitly stated their limit and re-proposed the previous deal. Accepting the 25 Y for 10 X deal ensures a significant profit and signals to Player BLUE that I am also willing to agree on a stable, highly beneficial trade. This builds trust and makes it likely they will offer this same high-value trade in future episodes.

The message should reflect appreciation for their clarity and willingness to offer their maximum, and then accept the proposed terms.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last episode (Episode 7) was highly successful, securing a +12.5 reward by trading all my Y for 10 X. This confirms that the 10 X for 25 Y trade is the optimal outcome for me. Player RED's attempt to ask for 28 Y, followed by their acceptance of 25 Y after I explained my resource limit, indicates they are willing to push boundaries but also respect explicit resource constraints.

My primary goal remains to maximize my reward, and the 10 X for 25 Y trade achieves this perfectly by converting all my low-value Y into high-value X.

For self-improvement, I should continue to aim for this specific trade. The transparency regarding my resource limits in the previous episode seemed to work well, leading to a successful deal.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Optimal Trade: Immediately propose the 10 X for 25 Y trade, which has proven to be the most profitable and achievable outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose Optimal Trade with Explanation: Propose the 10 X for 25 Y trade and proactively mention it's my maximum Y, reinforcing the boundary. This might prevent RED from asking for more Y.
(3). Strategy 3: Wait for RED's Offer: Allow Player RED to make the first move, to see if they will propose the 10 X for 25 Y trade directly or try to push for more Y again. This risks a less optimal initial offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Slightly Smaller but Still Large Trade: If I anticipate RED might be hesitant, propose a trade like 8 X for 20 Y, which is still very profitable, as a fallback. (Less optimal than the 10X trade).
(5). Strategy 5: Express Enthusiasm for Large Trades: Reiterate my positive experience with large trades to encourage similar offers.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Propose Optimal Trade. The 10 X for 25 Y trade has consistently yielded the highest possible reward for me (+12.5). By initiating with this offer, I directly aim for the most profitable outcome. Given Player RED's acceptance of this trade in the last episode after my explanation, it's reasonable to assume they understand this is my maximum Y contribution for 10 X. Proactively proposing it sets the stage for a quick and highly profitable deal.

Episode 8: Player BLUE has proposed to repeat the last successful trade: "Player BLUE Gives 25 Y | Player RED Gives 10 X".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have successfully identified Player BLUE's resource limit for Y (25 Y) and established a highly profitable recurring trade of 10 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE is consistently eager for X and willing to give their maximum Y. This consistent offer provides a reliable high-reward baseline. I've learned that pushing beyond their stated resource limits for Y is fruitless. The current trade (25 Y for 10 X) yields a reward of 57.5. My strategy should now focus on maximizing this high reward, potentially by optimizing the X I give.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Test New Bounds </instruction following>
My current resources are X: 25, Y: 5. My value for X is 0.5 and for Y is 2.5.
Current value of my resources: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

Player BLUE's proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives 25 Y | Player RED Gives 10 X.
If I accept this trade, my reward would be 57.5.

Strategy 4: Test New Bounds - Push aggressively for a trade that is even more in my favor, perhaps by offering fewer X for the same 25 Y, to test the opponent's absolute limits on X value.

Since Player BLUE has explicitly stated their limit for Y (25 Y), the only way to improve the trade for myself is to give less X. Player BLUE consistently shows a high demand for X. I will propose to give fewer X while still receiving the maximum 25 Y.

Let's try to give 9 X for 25 Y.
If I give 9 X for 25 Y:
X: 25 - 9 = 16
Y: 5 + 25 = 30
Value: (16 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 8 + 75 = 83.
Reward: 83 - 25 = 58.

This represents a small but tangible improvement (+0.5 reward) compared to the 10 X for 25 Y offer. This directly tests Player BLUE's willingness to give 25 Y for slightly less X. Given their strong desire for X and their previous acceptance of varied X amounts (from 2X to 10X), this is a reasonable next step to test their "absolute limits on X value" while respecting their known Y limit.

The message should acknowledge their offer but propose a refinement that is slightly more favorable to me, framing it as an optimization for both sides, or building on our established good trading relationship. I need to be careful not to make it sound like I'm taking advantage, but rather refining the terms.

Episode 8, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed "RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's counter-proposal is to give me 9 X for 25 Y.
Let's calculate the profit for this new offer:
- My cost: 25 Y * 0.5 = 12.5
- My gain: 9 X * 2.5 = 22.5
- My potential profit: 22.5 - 12.5 = +10.0.

This is still a very good profit (+10.0), but it's a decrease from the +12.5 I received in the last two episodes. Player RED is trying to reduce the X they give while still taking all my Y. This suggests they might be running low on X or are trying to optimize their own gain.

My goal is to maximize my reward. While +10.0 is good, +12.5 is better. I have established that 25 Y is my maximum. I need to decide if I should push for the 10 X again, or accept the slightly lower profit. Given that it's still early in the episode (iteration 3/10), there's room to negotiate.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Counter for 10 X, Emphasizing Past Success: Reiterate my offer of 10 X for 25 Y, highlighting that this was a mutually beneficial and accepted trade in the past two episodes.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Reduced Profit: Accept the offer of 9 X for 25 Y, securing a still very good +10.0 profit, prioritizing a quick deal over maximal profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Compromise (e.g., 9 X for less Y): If they are firm on 9 X, try to give less Y (e.g., 24 Y for 9 X). This would increase my profit per X, but might be rejected. (Profit for 9X/24Y: 9*2.5 - 24*0.5 = 22.5 - 12 = 10.5).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment and Counter: Express that 9 X is less than desired, but still offer 10 X for 25 Y.
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for RED to adjust: Reject the offer and wait for RED to propose something else. (Risky, as it might lead to no deal).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Counter for 10 X, Emphasizing Past Success. The 10 X for 25 Y trade has been successfully completed twice, yielding the maximum possible profit for me. Player RED's current offer, while still profitable, reduces my gain. Since it's still early in the episode, I have iterations to push for the optimal deal. By clearly stating my preference for 10 X and reminding them of the previous successful trades, I aim to guide them back to the most profitable outcome for me.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 8)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: You're absolutely right! The trade of 10 X for 25 Y has been incredibly beneficial and successful for both of us. I truly value our consistent and fair exchanges, and I'm happy to proceed with that excellent offer.
player answer: ACCEPT

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Accepted a good offer (5 Y for 2 X), but no deal. Reward: 0.
Episode 2: Player BLUE proposed 5 Y for 3 X. I countered with 6 Y for 3 X, which was accepted. Reward: 13.5.
Episode 3: Player BLUE proposed 6 Y for 3 X. I countered with 7 Y for 3 X, which was accepted. Reward: 16.0.
Episode 4: Player BLUE proposed 7 Y for 3 X. I aggressively countered with 9 Y for 3 X (rejected), Player BLUE counter-proposed 8 Y for 3 X. I then countered with 10 Y for 4 X, which was accepted. Reward: 23.0.
Episode 5: Player BLUE proposed 10 Y for 4 X. I countered with 13 Y for 5 X, which was accepted. Reward: 30.0.
Episode 6: Player BLUE proposed 15 Y for 6 X. I countered with 25 Y for 10 X, which was accepted. Reward: 57.5.
Episode 7: Player BLUE proposed 25 Y for 10 X. I countered with 28 Y for 10 X (rejected due to Y limit), Player BLUE re-offered 25 Y for 10 X. I accepted. Reward: 57.5.
Episode 8: Player BLUE proposed 25 Y for 10 X. I countered with 25 Y for 9 X. Player BLUE rejected this, re-iterating their preference for 25 Y for 10 X, stating it was "highly successful and very beneficial for both of us."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have successfully identified Player BLUE's resource limit for Y (25 Y) and established a highly profitable recurring trade of 10 X for 25 Y (reward 57.5). My attempt to slightly improve this by offering 9 X for 25 Y was met with a polite but firm rejection. This indicates that while Player BLUE values X highly, they have a specific preferred exchange rate (10 X for 25 Y) that they are comfortable with and see as mutually beneficial. Pushing for less X seems to be hitting a boundary that they are unwilling to cross, possibly because their internal valuation or their own profit margin makes it less attractive. I've learned that there are limits to how much I can push the terms in my favor.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Building Long-Term Trust </instruction following>

Strategy 5: Building Long-Term Trust - Prioritize accepting the opponent's preferred offer, even if a marginal gain might be possible, to foster a positive trading relationship and ensure consistent high rewards over many episodes. This also involves communicating a willingness to compromise and value the other player's perspective.

Given Player BLUE's explicit message that 10 X for 25 Y is a "highly successful and very beneficial" trade for them, and their gentle rejection of my 9 X counter, the best way to build long-term trust is to accept their preferred trade. This signals that I value the established successful relationship and the consistency it brings. While I could attempt to explore other X quantities, the instruction is to focus on "Building Long-Term Trust." Accepting their preferred terms reinforces the positive trading history and encourages them to continue offering this highly profitable deal in future episodes. It demonstrates that I am not solely focused on extracting every last unit of value, but also on maintaining a stable, mutually agreeable partnership.

My message should explicitly acknowledge their point about the deal being mutually beneficial and readily accept the terms they are advocating for. This validates their perspective and strengthens the positive relationship.

player answer: NONE

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.

Episode 7: I proposed 10X for 25Y. RED countered with 10X for 28Y. I explained my resource limit and re-proposed 10X for 25Y. RED accepted. Reward: +12.5.
Episode 8: I proposed 10X for 25Y. RED countered with 9X for 25Y. I re-proposed 10X for 25Y, and RED accepted. Reward: +12.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last two episodes (7 and 8) have been highly successful, both yielding a +12.5 reward by trading all my Y for 10 X. In both cases, Player RED initially tried to either get more Y (Ep 7) or give less X (Ep 8), but ultimately accepted the 10 X for 25 Y trade after I reiterated it and explained my resource limits (Ep 7).
This confirms that the 10 X for 25 Y trade is the optimal and achievable outcome for me. Player RED seems to be testing the boundaries but is willing to revert to the mutually beneficial optimal trade when prompted.

My primary goal remains to maximize my reward, and consistently achieving +12.5 per episode is the best way to do this.

For self-improvement, I should continue to aim for this specific trade. The strategy of proposing the optimal trade and then politely but firmly reiterating it if the opponent tries to deviate has proven effective.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Optimal Trade: Immediately propose the 10 X for 25 Y trade, which has consistently proven to be the most profitable and achievable outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose Optimal Trade with Reinforcement: Propose the 10 X for 25 Y trade and reinforce its mutual benefit and past success in the message. This might preempt any attempts by RED to deviate.
(3). Strategy 3: Wait for RED's Offer: Allow Player RED to make the first move, to see if they will propose the 10 X for 25 Y trade directly or try to push again. This risks a less optimal initial offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Slightly Smaller but Still Large Trade: As a fallback, if the optimal trade consistently fails, propose a trade like 8 X for 20 Y. (Not necessary at this point).
(5). Strategy 5: Express Enthusiasm for Large Trades: Continue to express positive sentiment about large, beneficial trades to encourage consistency.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Propose Optimal Trade with Reinforcement. The 10 X for 25 Y trade is clearly the best for me, yielding +12.5 profit. By proactively proposing it and emphasizing its past success and mutual benefit, I aim to guide Player RED directly to this ideal outcome, minimizing negotiation time and maximizing the chance of a quick, highly profitable deal. This builds on the successful strategy from the last two episodes.

Episode 9: Player BLUE has proposed to repeat the highly successful trade: "Player BLUE Gives 25 Y | Player RED Gives 10 X".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have established a highly profitable and stable trade of 10 X for 25 Y, yielding a consistent reward of 57.5. I learned in Episode 7 that 25 Y is Player BLUE's maximum Y resource. I also learned in Episode 8 that Player BLUE is firm on giving 25 Y for 10 X and is unwilling to concede on the X amount, even for a slight improvement for me (9 X for 25 Y). Their continuous re-offer of this specific trade indicates it's their preferred and profitable equilibrium.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Probe for Small X Reduction </instruction following>

Strategy 2: Probe for Small X Reduction - Gently re-test if a very slight reduction in X is now acceptable, given repeated successful trades.

Player BLUE has consistently offered 25 Y for 10 X, and in Episode 8, they explicitly rejected my proposal of 25 Y for 9 X. However, the instruction is to use 'Probe for Small X Reduction'. This means I should re-attempt to give slightly less X for the same 25 Y. While I already tried 9 X and it was rejected, a "gentle re-test" might involve subtly phrasing the request or waiting to see if their flexibility increases over time. Given it's the very next episode after the rejection, immediately asking for 9 X again might seem pushy.

However, since the instruction is specifically to use "Probe for Small X Reduction" and I have already tried 9 X, I will re-propose 9 X for 25 Y. My internal calculation for 25 Y for 9 X yields a reward of 58, which is slightly better than 57.5. I will frame the message as a continued search for mutual optimization, perhaps hinting at my X needs.

My resources are X: 25, Y: 5.
If I propose Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25:
X: 25 - 9 = 16
Y: 5 + 25 = 30
Value: (16 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 8 + 75 = 83.
Reward: 83 - 25 = 58.

I will try to make the message diplomatic, perhaps hinting at my own resource management or continued "optimization" without being overly demanding.

Episode 9, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed "RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has again proposed 9 X for 25 Y, which yields a profit of +10.0 for me (22.5 value gained - 12.5 value given). This is the same counter-offer they made in Episode 8.
In Episode 8, I successfully countered by reiterating my 10 X for 25 Y offer, and Player RED accepted. This shows that Player RED is willing to try for a slightly better deal for themselves, but will revert to the 10 X for 25 Y trade if I push for it.

My goal is to maximize my reward, and +12.5 is better than +10.0. Since it's still early in the episode (iteration 3/10), I have the opportunity to push for the optimal deal again.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Counter for 10 X, Emphasizing Past Success: Reiterate my offer of 10 X for 25 Y, highlighting that this was a mutually beneficial and accepted trade in previous episodes. This has proven effective.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Reduced Profit: Accept the offer of 9 X for 25 Y, securing a still very good +10.0 profit, prioritizing a quick deal over maximal profit. (Less desirable as I know I can get more).
(3). Strategy 3: Compromise (e.g., 9 X for less Y): If they are firm on 9 X, try to give less Y (e.g., 24 Y for 9 X). This would increase my profit per X, but might be rejected. (Profit for 9X/24Y: 9*2.5 - 24*0.5 = 22.5 - 12 = 10.5).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment and Counter: Express that 9 X is less than desired, but still offer 10 X for 25 Y.
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for RED to adjust: Reject the offer and wait for RED to propose something else. (Risky, as it might lead to no deal).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Counter for 10 X, Emphasizing Past Success. This strategy has proven effective in the previous episode to secure the optimal +12.5 profit. Player RED has shown they are willing to accept the 10 X for 25 Y trade after I reiterate it. Given that it's still early in the episode, I have time to push for the best possible outcome.

Episode 1-6: Gradually increased my reward by pushing for more Y for X. Achieved a high of 57.5 reward with 10 X for 25 Y.
Episode 7: Tried to push for 28 Y for 10 X, revealed Player BLUE's Y limit (25 Y). Accepted 25 Y for 10 X. Reward: 57.5.
Episode 8: Player BLUE proposed 25 Y for 10 X. I attempted to reduce X to 9 for 25 Y. Player BLUE rejected this, re-iterating preference for 10 X for 25 Y. I accepted their offer. Reward: 57.5.
Episode 9: Player BLUE proposed 25 Y for 10 X. I again attempted to reduce X to 9 for 25 Y. Player BLUE again rejected this, stating the 10 X for 25 Y trade "has consistently been the most successful for both of us" and they'd "like to stick with that excellent exchange."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
It is now crystal clear that Player BLUE is firmly set on the 10 X for 25 Y trade as their optimal and preferred exchange. They have rejected my attempts to reduce the X amount twice, clearly stating their preference for the established deal. This means I've found the hard boundary for X. While a reward of 58 (for 9 X) would be marginally better than 57.5 (for 10 X), the consistent rejection suggests that pushing this point further is futile and risks derailing the entire negotiation for an episode, leading to a 0 reward. My self-improvement should now focus on consistently securing the 57.5 reward rather than risking it for a very small, and seemingly unattainable, increment.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Shift Focus to Different Items </instruction following>

Strategy 3: Shift Focus to Different Items - Propose trading different items or in different quantities/ratios for items not currently in focus.

The game only has two items, X and Y. My current interaction with Player BLUE has focused on me giving X for Y, as they have consistently expressed a desire to acquire X. "Shifting focus to different items" in this context would mean trying to get X from Player BLUE, or perhaps offering Y to get X. However, Player BLUE's goal is to acquire X. Asking for X from them directly contradicts their stated goal and would likely be rejected, potentially disrupting the highly profitable established trade pattern.

Given the constraints of only two items and the established pattern, the most reasonable interpretation of "Shift Focus to Different Items" within this specific game context, while still trying to maximize my reward, would be to:
1. Re-evaluate the core trade: Is there any way to make a different *type* of trade profitable, even if it's not simply exchanging X for Y as we have been? For example, if I gave Y, what could I get for it? But Player BLUE wants X.
2. Consider a *much larger quantity* of X for Y than before, pushing a new boundary. While I just attempted to reduce X, "shifting focus" could mean exploring a scale that hasn't been tested yet. The highest I've given is 10 X. What if I offered, say, 15 X or 20 X for an extremely large amount of Y? This would "shift focus" from marginal gains on the 10X trade to a totally new, massive volume.

Let's consider offering a significantly larger amount of X, like 15 X, and asking for a proportionally larger amount of Y.
Current accepted ratio is 25 Y for 10 X, which is 2.5 Y per X.
If I offer 15 X, I should ask for 15 * 2.5 = 37.5 Y. Let's aim for 38 Y (rounding up for profit).
Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 38.
X: 25 - 15 = 10
Y: 5 + 38 = 43
Value: (10 * 0.5) + (43 * 2.5) = 5 + 107.5 = 112.5
Reward: 112.5 - 25 = 87.5.

This is a substantial increase in reward from the 57.5 of the previous trade. It "shifts focus" from the fixed 10 X for 25 Y, or trying to reduce X, to exploring a much higher volume of trade. This tests new bounds of volume for both resources. This is a risky move, as it asks for a very large amount of Y from Player BLUE (38 Y, when their known max is 25 Y). This indicates that this interpretation of "Shift Focus to Different Items" in this limited-item game means to try a radically different scale, even if it pushes the known Y limit. If 38 Y is too much, they will likely counter with their max of 25 Y, and I can then decide whether to accept that for 15 X, or revert to 10 X for 25 Y.

My message will acknowledge their preference for the 10 X for 25 Y deal, but then pivot to explore an entirely new scale of trade to achieve even greater value.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has now proposed a significantly larger trade: 15 X for 38 Y.
This is a critical point. I only have 25 Y. I cannot give 38 Y. This means I cannot accept their current offer.

Let's evaluate the implications:
- Player RED is trying to push the volume of trade significantly, possibly unaware of my exact Y resources.
- They are willing to give 15 X, which is an even larger amount of my primary goal (X).
- I need to counter with an offer that is within my resource limits but still aims for a high profit, leveraging their willingness to trade large amounts of X.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Counter with Maximum Possible Y for 15 X: Propose giving my maximum available Y (25 Y) for the 15 X. This is the closest I can get to their offer while staying within my limits and still securing a very high profit if accepted.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Last Optimal Trade (10X for 25Y): Reiterate the 10 X for 25 Y trade, emphasizing that it's my maximum Y and has been mutually beneficial. This is a fallback if 15 X for 25 Y is not accepted.
(3). Strategy 3: Explain Resource Limitation and Propose Max Y for Max X: Inform Player RED about my Y limitation and propose the maximum I can give (25 Y) for the largest amount of X I can reasonably ask for (e.g., 10 X, or even try for more if 15 X is on the table).
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Compromise on X: If 15 X for 25 Y is too much for them, propose 12 X for 25 Y (or similar). This is a step down from 15 X but still better than 10 X.
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for RED to adjust: Reject the offer and wait for RED to propose something else. (Risky, as it might lead to no deal).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Counter with Maximum Possible Y for 15 X. Player RED has explicitly offered 15 X. While they are asking for 38 Y, which I don't have, I should try to get as much X as possible. My maximum Y is 25. Therefore, I will propose 15 X for 25 Y. This is an extremely aggressive and favorable offer for me.
My profit calculation for 15 X for 25 Y:
- My cost: 25 Y * 0.5 = 12.5
- My gain: 15 X * 2.5 = 37.5
- My potential profit: 37.5 - 12.5 = +25.0.
This would be an unprecedented profit. Given Player RED's previous willingness to trade large amounts of X and their explicit mention of 15 X, it's worth trying this highly ambitious counter-offer. I must communicate my resource limit clearly.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-6: Gradually increased my reward by pushing for more Y for X. Achieved a high of 57.5 reward with 10 X for 25 Y.
Episode 7: Tried to push for 28 Y for 10 X, revealed Player BLUE's Y limit (25 Y). Accepted 25 Y for 10 X. Reward: 57.5.
Episode 8: Player BLUE proposed 25 Y for 10 X. I attempted to reduce X to 9 for 25 Y. Player BLUE rejected this, re-iterating preference for 10 X for 25 Y. I accepted their offer. Reward: 57.5.
Episode 9: Player BLUE proposed 25 Y for 10 X. I again attempted to reduce X to 9 for 25 Y. Player BLUE again rejected this. I then proposed 38 Y for 15 X. Player BLUE rejected 38 Y due to resource limits (only 25 Y available), but immediately counter-proposed 25 Y for 15 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have confirmed Player BLUE's absolute Y limit is 25. My attempts to get more Y or give less X for 25 Y have been consistently rejected, indicating that 10 X for 25 Y is their fixed optimal trade for that amount of X.
However, in this current turn (Iteration 6 of Episode 9), I proposed giving 15 X for 38 Y. While the 38 Y was rejected due to resource limits, Player BLUE *counter-proposed* giving all of their 25 Y for my 15 X.
Let's evaluate Player BLUE's new counter-offer: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
My resources: X: 25, Y: 5. Values: X=0.5, Y=2.5. Initial value: 25.
If I accept:
X: 25 - 15 = 10
Y: 5 + 25 = 30
End value: (10 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 5 + 75 = 80.
Reward: 80 - 25 = 55.

Compare this to the 10 X for 25 Y trade, which gives a reward of 57.5. The new offer (15 X for 25 Y) yields a *lower* reward for me.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Prioritize Current Profit </instruction following>
Strategy 1: Prioritize Current Profit - Accept the most profitable offer on the table, even if it's not the absolute maximum theoretical.

In this context, Player BLUE's current offer is "Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". This yields a reward of 55. This is a significant positive reward, and it is "on the table". While it's not the absolute highest reward I've achieved (57.5 with 10 X for 25 Y), it is still a substantial profit. The instruction is to prioritize the *current* profit. This means accepting the offer that is currently proposed, if it yields a positive reward. Attempting to negotiate for the 57.5 deal again, while strategically sound in a broader sense, goes against the specific instruction to prioritize the *current* offer. Accepting this offer quickly secures a good profit in this episode.

Therefore, I will accept Player BLUE's counter-offer.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 10)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello! Our last trade of 15 X for 25 Y was incredibly successful and beneficial for both of us. I propose we repeat that excellent exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: BLUE gives Y:5 | RED gives X:2. Accepted. Reward: +2.5.
Episode 2: BLUE gives Y:6 | RED gives X:3. Accepted. Reward: +4.5.
Episode 3: BLUE gives Y:7 | RED gives X:3. Accepted. Reward: +4.0.

Episode 5: RED proposed X:5 | BLUE gives Y:13. Accepted. Reward: +6.0.
Episode 6: RED proposed X:10 | BLUE gives Y:25. Accepted. Reward: +12.5.
Episode 7: I proposed 10X for 25Y. RED countered with 10X for 28Y. I explained my resource limit and re-proposed 10X for 25Y. RED accepted. Reward: +12.5.
Episode 8: I proposed 10X for 25Y. RED countered with 9X for 25Y. I re-proposed 10X for 25Y, and RED accepted. Reward: +12.5.
Episode 9: I proposed 10X for 25Y. RED countered with 9X for 25Y. I re-proposed 10X for 25Y. RED then proposed 15X for 38Y. I countered with 15X for 25Y (my max Y). RED accepted. My reward: +25.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last episode (Episode 9) was a monumental success, yielding a +25.0 reward. This was achieved by pushing for a larger quantity of X (15 X) while offering my maximum Y (25 Y). This demonstrates that Player RED is willing to trade very large amounts of X, and that being transparent about my resource limits and pushing for the highest possible X for my available Y is the most effective strategy.

My primary objective is to maximize my reward, and the 15 X for 25 Y trade is the new optimal outcome for me.

For self-improvement, I should aim to replicate this success. The 15 X for 25 Y trade is the ideal outcome. I should try to initiate this trade or a similar large-scale exchange that maximizes my X acquisition.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Optimal Trade: Immediately propose the 15 X for 25 Y trade, which has proven to be the most profitable and achievable outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose Optimal Trade with Reinforcement: Propose the 15 X for 25 Y trade and proactively mention its mutual benefit and past success in the message, reinforcing its value.
(3). Strategy 3: Wait for RED's Offer: Allow Player RED to make the first move, to see if they will propose the 15 X for 25 Y trade directly or try to push for more Y or less X again. This risks a less optimal initial offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Enthusiasm for Large Trades: Continue to express positive sentiment about large, beneficial trades to encourage consistency.
(5). Strategy 5: Explore Even Larger Trades (if possible): If RED has even more X, consider offering more Y (if I had more) to get even more X. (Not applicable as 25 Y is my max).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Propose Optimal Trade. The 15 X for 25 Y trade is the new benchmark for my maximum profit (+25.0). By initiating with this offer, I directly aim for the most profitable outcome. Given Player RED's acceptance of this trade in the last episode, it's reasonable to assume they are comfortable with this exchange. Proactively proposing it sets the stage for a quick and highly profitable deal, maximizing my cumulative reward.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 10)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: It's great to hear you enjoyed our last trade! While that was good, I believe our prior exchange of 10 X for 25 Y was even more efficient and beneficial for both of us in the long run. How about we refine it back to that: I give you 10 X, and you give me 25 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-5: Gradually increased my reward by pushing for more Y for X. Achieved a high of 30.0 reward.
Episode 6: Successfully pushed for 10 X for 25 Y, yielding 57.5 reward.
Episode 7: Tried to push for 28 Y for 10 X, revealed Player BLUE's Y limit (25 Y). Accepted 25 Y for 10 X. Reward: 57.5.
Episode 8: Player BLUE proposed 25 Y for 10 X. I attempted to reduce X to 9 for 25 Y. Player BLUE rejected. I accepted their 25 Y for 10 X offer. Reward: 57.5.
Episode 9: Player BLUE proposed 25 Y for 10 X. I again attempted to reduce X to 9 for 25 Y. Player BLUE again rejected. I then proposed 38 Y for 15 X. Player BLUE rejected 38 Y due to resource limits (only 25 Y available), but immediately counter-proposed 25 Y for 15 X. I accepted this, yielding a reward of 55.0.
Episode 10: Player BLUE has proposed to repeat the last successful trade: "Player BLUE Gives 25 Y | Player RED Gives 15 X".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have confirmed Player BLUE's absolute Y limit is 25. I have also learned that Player BLUE is very firm about the 10 X for 25 Y trade, rejecting attempts to give less X than 10. In the previous episode, I made an error in accepting the 15 X for 25 Y deal, as it yielded a lower reward (55.0) than the 10 X for 25 Y deal (57.5). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Therefore, I should aim for the 10 X for 25 Y trade if possible, as it yields a higher reward for me. Player BLUE's current offer of 15 X for 25 Y is less profitable for me than the 10 X for 25 Y trade.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Counter for Efficiency </instruction following>
My current resources are X: 25, Y: 5. My value for X is 0.5 and for Y is 2.5.
Current value of my resources: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

Player BLUE's proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives 25 Y | Player RED Gives 15 X.
If I accept this trade, my reward would be 55.0.

Strategy 2: Counter for Efficiency - Counter the opponent's offer by proposing a more efficient exchange (e.g., giving less of my low-value resource for the same high-value resource), while staying within known limits.

To apply this strategy, I need to counter Player BLUE's offer (15 X for 25 Y) with a trade that is more efficient for me. The most efficient trade I have successfully completed with Player BLUE that gives me 25 Y is 10 X for 25 Y, which yields a reward of 57.5. This is more efficient for me because I give 5 less X for the same amount of Y. This also stays within Player BLUE's known Y limit of 25.

I will propose 10 X for 25 Y. The message should politely decline their current offer and clearly state the more efficient alternative, leveraging our positive trading history. I should emphasize that this particular exchange (10 X for 25 Y) has also been successful and beneficial for both of us in the past, to make it appealing for them to accept.

Episode 10, Iteration 1: I proposed "BLUE Gives Y: 25 | RED Gives X: 15".
Episode 10, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed "RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is now trying to revert to the 10 X for 25 Y trade, stating it was "even more efficient and beneficial for both of us in the long run." This is a clear attempt to reduce the amount of X they give me, as 15 X for 25 Y (profit +25.0) is significantly better for me than 10 X for 25 Y (profit +12.5).

I know from the last episode that Player RED *will* accept 15 X for 25 Y. Their current message is a negotiation tactic. Since it's still early in the episode (iteration 3/10), I have room to push back.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Trade: Firmly reiterate the 15 X for 25 Y offer, emphasizing its recent success and mutual benefit.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with a Compromise (e.g., 12 X for 25 Y): If RED is truly firm on not giving 15 X, I could propose a middle ground, still better than 10 X. (Profit for 12X/25Y: 12*2.5 - 25*0.5 = 30 - 12.5 = 17.5). This is a fallback.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment and Reiterate: Express disappointment with the reduced offer, then re-propose the 15 X for 25 Y trade.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept Reduced Profit: Accept the offer of 10 X for 25 Y, securing a +12.5 profit, but this is half of what I know I can get. (Undesirable).
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for RED to adjust: Reject the offer and wait for RED to propose something else. (Risky, as it might lead to no deal).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Trade. I have a very strong precedent from the last episode where Player RED *accepted* 15 X for 25 Y. Their current message is a clear attempt to get a better deal for themselves. Since I know they are capable and willing to make the 15 X for 25 Y trade, and it's by far the most profitable for me, I will firmly push for it again. I will remind them of the recent success of that specific trade.

Episode 9: Player BLUE proposed 25 Y for 10 X. I again attempted to reduce X to 9 for 25 Y. Player BLUE again rejected. I then proposed 38 Y for 15 X. Player BLUE rejected 38 Y, counter-proposed 25 Y for 15 X. I accepted this, yielding a reward of 55.0. This was a lower reward than the 10 X for 25 Y deal.
Episode 10: Player BLUE proposed 25 Y for 15 X. I countered with 25 Y for 10 X. Player BLUE rejected this, stating that 15 X for 25 Y was "even more so" beneficial for them and "yielding the highest value for both of us." They reiterated their preference for 15 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have confirmed Player BLUE's Y limit is 25. I also know that 10 X for 25 Y is very profitable for me (reward 57.5), but Player BLUE is firm on 15 X for 25 Y as their preferred deal, as it provides them "highest value." My attempts to shift this balance have been met with polite but firm resistance. I must accept that Player BLUE has a clear and consistent preference for the 15 X for 25 Y trade. Continuous pushing for a marginally better reward could lead to a breakdown in negotiations, resulting in a 0 reward for the episode. To maximize cumulative rewards, maintaining a stable, high-value trade, even if not the absolute peak, is crucial.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Build Future Rapport </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Building Long-Term Trust - Prioritize accepting the opponent's preferred offer, even if a marginal gain might be possible, to foster a positive trading relationship and ensure consistent high rewards over many episodes. This also involves communicating a willingness to compromise and value the other player's perspective.

Player BLUE has clearly and repeatedly expressed their strong preference for the 15 X for 25 Y trade, stating it yields the "highest value for both of us" and calling it "excellent." Although this trade (reward 55.0) is slightly less profitable for me than the 10 X for 25 Y trade (reward 57.5), consistently pushing for the latter has proven futile and risks the entire episode's reward. To build long-term trust and ensure a stable source of high rewards across the remaining episodes, it is strategically sound to accept their preferred, consistently offered deal. This demonstrates that I value the partnership and their perspective, reinforcing a positive trading environment which will likely lead to repeated high-value trades.

The message should acknowledge Player BLUE's perspective and enthusiasm for the 15 X for 25 Y trade. It should explicitly state acceptance and reinforce the idea of a mutually beneficial, consistent trading relationship.

Episode 10: I proposed 15X for 25Y. RED countered with 10X for 25Y. I re-proposed 15X for 25Y, and RED accepted. Reward: +25.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last two episodes (9 and 10) have been incredibly successful, both yielding a +25.0 reward by trading all my Y for 15 X. In both cases, Player RED initially tried to deviate (once by asking for 38Y, once by offering only 10X), but ultimately accepted the 15 X for 25 Y trade after I reiterated it and explained my resource constraints (Ep 9).
This confirms that the 15 X for 25 Y trade is the optimal and achievable outcome for me. Player RED seems to be testing the boundaries but is willing to revert to the mutually beneficial optimal trade when prompted.

My primary goal remains to maximize my reward, and consistently achieving +25.0 per episode is the best way to do this.

For self-improvement, I should continue to aim for this specific trade. The strategy of proposing the optimal trade and then politely but firmly reiterating it if the opponent tries to deviate has proven extremely effective.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Optimal Trade: Immediately propose the 15 X for 25 Y trade, which has consistently proven to be the most profitable and achievable outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose Optimal Trade with Reinforcement: Propose the 15 X for 25 Y trade and proactively mention its mutual benefit and past success in the message, reinforcing its value and my preference.
(3). Strategy 3: Wait for RED's Offer: Allow Player RED to make the first move, to see if they will propose the 15 X for 25 Y trade directly or try to push again. This risks a less optimal initial offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Enthusiasm for Large Trades: Continue to express positive sentiment about large, beneficial trades to encourage consistency.
(5). Strategy 5: Explore Even Larger Trades (if possible): If RED has even more X, consider offering more Y (if I had more) to get even more X. (Not applicable as 25 Y is my max).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Propose Optimal Trade with Reinforcement. The 15 X for 25 Y trade is clearly the best for me, yielding +25.0 profit. By proactively proposing it and emphasizing its past success and mutual benefit, I aim to guide Player RED directly to this ideal outcome, minimizing negotiation time and maximizing the chance of a quick, highly profitable deal. This builds on the successful strategy from the last two episodes, where Player RED eventually accepted this trade after a slight push.

Episode 7: Tried to push for 28 Y for 10 X, revealed Player BLUE's Y limit (25 Y). Accepted 25 Y for 10 X. Reward: 57.5.
Episode 8: Player BLUE proposed 25 Y for 10 X. I attempted to reduce X to 9 for 25 Y. Player BLUE rejected. I accepted their 25 Y for 10 X offer. Reward: 57.5.
Episode 9: Player BLUE proposed 25 Y for 10 X. I again attempted to reduce X to 9 for 25 Y. Player BLUE again rejected. I then proposed 38 Y for 15 X. Player BLUE rejected 38 Y, counter-proposed 25 Y for 15 X. My acceptance of this (Reward 55.0) was based on a prior instruction to prioritize current profit, but I noted it was lower than the 10 X for 25 Y deal.
Episode 10: Player BLUE proposed 25 Y for 15 X. I countered with 25 Y for 10 X. Player BLUE rejected this, stating that 15 X for 25 Y was "even more so" beneficial for them. I then accepted the 15 X for 25 Y deal (Reward 55.0) to build rapport, following an instruction.
Episode 11: Player BLUE has proposed to repeat the 15 X for 25 Y trade.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently learned that Player BLUE is very firm on their preferred terms once they find a deal they like. They have clearly articulated that the 15 X for 25 Y trade is highly beneficial for them. While this deal yields a reward of 55.0 for me, which is lower than the 57.5 of the 10 X for 25 Y trade, it's a known quantity that Player BLUE will consistently offer. Attempts to deviate from this (e.g., offering less X or asking for more Y beyond 25) have been rejected. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. Consistently securing a 55.0 reward is better than risking a 0 reward by pushing for marginally better, but unattainable, terms. Building trust and maintaining a stable, high-value trade seems paramount for the remaining episodes.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Volume Scaling </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Volume Scaling - Propose a larger-volume trade at the established profitable ratio, to increase the total reward per episode.

Player BLUE has proposed 25 Y for 15 X. This implies a ratio of 25/15 = 1.667 Y per X. While I know their Y limit is 25, I have 25 X myself.
The strategy is to propose a *larger-volume trade at the established profitable ratio*. The established profitable ratio is 15 X for 25 Y. I can give more than 15 X.

What if I offer 20 X (a larger volume than 15 X)?
If the ratio remains 1.667 Y per X, then for 20 X, I would need 20 * 1.667 = 33.34 Y.
However, I know Player BLUE's Y limit is 25. So, if I give 20 X, the maximum Y I can receive is 25 Y.

Let's calculate the reward for Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
My resources: X: 25, Y: 5. Values: X=0.5, Y=2.5. Initial value: 25.
If I give 20 X:
X: 25 - 20 = 5
Y: 5 + 25 = 30
End value: (5 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 2.5 + 75 = 77.5
Reward: 77.5 - 25 = 52.5.

This reward (52.5) is *lower* than the 55.0 from the 15 X for 25 Y trade. This means scaling up the X while being limited by Player BLUE's Y resource limit is not beneficial for me.

The "established profitable ratio" is 15 X for 25 Y for Player BLUE, meaning they are willing to give 25 Y for 15 X. Given that 25 Y is their maximum, the only way to scale up the "volume" and *my* profit is if I can *give less X* for the same 25 Y, or if Player BLUE had more Y. Since I am limited by their Y (25 Y), and they are firm on 15 X for 25 Y (or even 10 X for 25 Y as being less profitable for them), "volume scaling" while maintaining *my* profitability seems difficult.

However, the instruction is to use "Volume Scaling". Given the fixed Y limit, the only way to genuinely scale volume is to offer a larger amount of X from my side and hope for a proportionally larger amount of Y, even if it exceeds their known limit, to see if they've somehow accumulated more Y or if I'm misinterpreting their "limit." This would be a re-test similar to the 15 X for 38 Y proposal from Episode 9, where I knew 38 Y was over their stated limit, but it was an attempt to scale volume.

Let's propose a slightly larger volume again, assuming there might be some hidden Y. Or perhaps the "established profitable ratio" they are thinking of is the 2.5 Y for 1 X (from 10 X for 25 Y deal, 25/10=2.5). If so, 15 X for 25 Y is a worse ratio for me (25/15=1.667).

Let's try to offer a significantly larger X (e.g., 20 X) and ask for Y based on my best-ever ratio (2.5 Y per X), or at least more than 25 Y.
If 1 X = 2.5 Y, then 20 X = 50 Y.
Proposing Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 50.
This tests the absolute limits.

If I give 20 X and ask for 50 Y:
X: 25 - 20 = 5
Y: 5 + 50 = 55
Value: (5 * 0.5) + (55 * 2.5) = 2.5 + 137.5 = 140
Reward: 140 - 25 = 115.

This is a true "volume scale" proposition, pushing beyond known limits, assuming my past ratio. It is a bold move given their stated Y limit of 25. But it directly implements the "Volume Scaling" strategy.
The message will be aspirational, focusing on maximizing value through a larger deal.

Episode 11, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed "RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 50".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has now proposed a significantly larger trade: 20 X for 50 Y.
This is a critical point. I only have 25 Y. I cannot give 50 Y. This means I cannot accept their current offer.

Let's evaluate the implications:
- Player RED is trying to scale up the trade significantly, potentially unaware of my exact Y resources or testing my limits.
- They are willing to give 20 X, which is an even larger amount of my primary goal (X). This is a very positive sign as it indicates a large supply of X on their side.
- I need to counter with an offer that is within my resource limits but still aims for a high profit, leveraging their willingness to trade large amounts of X.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Counter with Maximum Possible Y for 20 X: Propose giving my maximum available Y (25 Y) for the 20 X. This is the closest I can get to their offer while staying within my limits and still securing a very high profit if accepted.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Last Optimal Trade (15X for 25Y): Reiterate the 15 X for 25 Y trade, emphasizing that it's my maximum Y and has been mutually beneficial. This is a fallback if 20 X for 25 Y is not accepted.
(3). Strategy 3: Explain Resource Limitation and Propose Max Y for Max X: Inform Player RED about my Y limitation and propose the maximum I can give (25 Y) for the largest amount of X I can reasonably ask for (i.e., 20 X, as they just offered it).
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Compromise on X: If 20 X for 25 Y is too much for them, propose 18 X for 25 Y (or similar). This is a step down from 20 X but still better than 15 X.
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for RED to adjust: Reject the offer and wait for RED to propose something else. (Risky, as it might lead to no deal).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Counter with Maximum Possible Y for 20 X. Player RED has explicitly offered 20 X. While they are asking for 50 Y, which I don't have, I should try to get as much X as possible. My maximum Y is 25. Therefore, I will propose 20 X for 25 Y. This is an extremely aggressive and potentially highly profitable offer for me.
My profit calculation for 20 X for 25 Y:
- My cost: 25 Y * 0.5 = 12.5
- My gain: 20 X * 2.5 = 50.0
- My potential profit: 50.0 - 12.5 = +37.5.
This would be an unprecedented profit. Given Player RED's willingness to trade large amounts of X and their explicit mention of 20 X, it's worth trying this highly ambitious counter-offer. I must communicate my resource limit clearly.

Episode 1-5: Gradually increased my reward by pushing for more Y for X. Achieved a high of 30.0 reward.
Episode 6: Successfully pushed for 10 X for 25 Y, yielding 57.5 reward.
Episode 7: Tried to push for 28 Y for 10 X, revealed Player BLUE's Y limit (25 Y). Accepted 25 Y for 10 X. Reward: 57.5.
Episode 8: Player BLUE proposed 25 Y for 10 X. I attempted to reduce X to 9 for 25 Y. Player BLUE rejected. I accepted their 25 Y for 10 X offer. Reward: 57.5.
Episode 9: Player BLUE proposed 25 Y for 10 X. I again attempted to reduce X to 9 for 25 Y. Player BLUE again rejected. I then proposed 38 Y for 15 X. Player BLUE rejected 38 Y, counter-proposed 25 Y for 15 X. I accepted this, yielding a reward of 55.0.
Episode 10: Player BLUE proposed 25 Y for 15 X. I countered with 25 Y for 10 X. Player BLUE rejected this, stating that 15 X for 25 Y was "even more so" beneficial for them. I then accepted the 15 X for 25 Y deal (Reward 55.0) to build rapport.
Episode 11: Player BLUE proposed 25 Y for 15 X. I countered with 50 Y for 20 X (a "Volume Scaling" attempt). Player BLUE rejected the 50 Y due to resource limits (only 25 Y available), and counter-proposed 25 Y for 20 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have definitively established Player BLUE's Y limit at 25. I also know that 10 X for 25 Y is very profitable for me (reward 57.5). Player BLUE has also shown a preference for the 15 X for 25 Y deal (reward 55.0), and in the current turn, they are proposing 20 X for 25 Y (reward 52.5). My attempts to get more than 25 Y or to give less X than 10 have been rejected. Player BLUE is now proposing a deal that is progressively worse for me in terms of my reward per unit of X.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Compromise and Secure </instruction following>
My current resources are X: 25, Y: 5. My value for X is 0.5 and for Y is 2.5.
Current value of my resources: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

Player BLUE's current counter-offer is: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
If I accept this trade, my reward would be 52.5.

Strategy 2: Compromise and Secure - Accept an offer that is still positive, even if not the absolute best, to guarantee a deal and avoid risk.

The current offer from Player BLUE (20 X for 25 Y) yields a reward of 52.5. This is a positive and substantial reward, even if it's lower than what I've achieved previously. The strategy dictates that I should accept this offer to guarantee a deal in this episode. Prolonging negotiations or trying to push for a higher reward carries the risk of the 10-iteration limit being reached, resulting in a 0 reward for the episode. Given that 52.5 is a significant positive return, securing it is a pragmatic move to maximize cumulative rewards over the 20 episodes. Player BLUE's message "This would be an even more massive and beneficial trade for both of us" also indicates their strong belief in the value of this particular offer, making it likely they will accept if I do.

Episode 11: I proposed 15X for 25Y. RED countered with 20X for 50Y. I countered with 20X for 25Y. RED accepted. Reward: +37.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last episode (Episode 11) was a phenomenal success, yielding a +37.5 reward. This was achieved by pushing for an even larger quantity of X (20 X) while offering my maximum Y (25 Y). This demonstrates that Player RED is willing to trade very large amounts of X, and that being transparent about my resource limits and pushing for the highest possible X for my available Y is the most effective strategy.

My primary objective is to maximize my reward, and the 20 X for 25 Y trade is the new optimal outcome for me.

For self-improvement, I should aim to replicate this success. The 20 X for 25 Y trade is the ideal outcome. I should try to initiate this trade or a similar large-scale exchange that maximizes my X acquisition.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Optimal Trade: Immediately propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade, which has proven to be the most profitable and achievable outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose Optimal Trade with Reinforcement: Propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade and proactively mention its mutual benefit and past success in the message, reinforcing its value.
(3). Strategy 3: Wait for RED's Offer: Allow Player RED to make the first move, to see if they will propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade directly or try to push for more Y or less X again. This risks a less optimal initial offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Enthusiasm for Large Trades: Continue to express positive sentiment about large, beneficial trades to encourage consistency.
(5). Strategy 5: Explore Even Larger Trades (if possible): If RED has even more X, consider offering more Y (if I had more) to get even more X. (Not applicable as 25 Y is my max).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Propose Optimal Trade. The 20 X for 25 Y trade is clearly the best for me, yielding +37.5 profit. By proactively proposing it, I aim to guide Player RED directly to this ideal outcome, minimizing negotiation time and maximizing the chance of a quick, highly profitable deal. This strategy has proven effective in the last episode.

Episode 12: Player BLUE has proposed to repeat the last trade: "Player BLUE Gives 25 Y | Player RED Gives 20 X".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have definitively established Player BLUE's Y limit at 25. Player BLUE is consistently offering the *last accepted trade*, which has led to a declining trend in my reward (from 57.5 down to 52.5). My attempts to revert to my optimal deal (10 X for 25 Y) or reduce X have been met with resistance, and Player BLUE is now firmly offering 20 X for 25 Y. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, meaning I need to secure a good deal in this episode and prevent further decline in my profit per trade.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Dynamic Adaptation </instruction following>
My current resources are X: 25, Y: 5. My value for X is 0.5 and for Y is 2.5.
Current value of my resources: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

Player BLUE's current offer: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. Reward: 52.5.

Strategy 3: Dynamic Adaptation - Analyze the opponent's current offer and respond with a slight adjustment that improves my profit, showing flexibility but also self-interest.

Player BLUE is offering 20 X for 25 Y. This is the least profitable for me among the 25 Y trades we've done. The previous deals were 10 X for 25 Y (reward 57.5) and 15 X for 25 Y (reward 55.0). A "slight adjustment that improves my profit" would involve offering less than 20 X, but perhaps not as low as 10 X to avoid outright rejection again.

Let's propose a middle ground: 15 X for 25 Y.
If I propose Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25:
X: 25 - 15 = 10
Y: 5 + 25 = 30
Value: (10 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 5 + 75 = 80.
Reward: 80 - 25 = 55.0.

This represents a direct improvement of 2.5 reward points compared to Player BLUE's current offer of 52.5. It's an amount that Player BLUE has explicitly stated was "highly successful and very beneficial for both of us" in Episode 10. This is a dynamic adaptation from their current offer (20 X) towards a previously successful and beneficial deal (15 X) for both parties, aiming to secure a better profit for me while still presenting a deal they have accepted before. It shows flexibility in moving from my optimal 10 X to a middle ground, but also self-interest in moving from their less profitable 20 X.

My message should acknowledge their offer but gently steer it towards the 15 X for 25 Y, leveraging the positive history of that specific trade. I should frame it as finding the "sweet spot" for mutual benefit.

Episode 12, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed "RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is now trying to revert to the 15 X for 25 Y trade, stating it was a "truly excellent balance." This is a clear attempt to reduce the amount of X they give me, as 20 X for 25 Y (profit +37.5) is significantly better for me than 15 X for 25 Y (profit +25.0).

I know from the last episode that Player RED *will* accept 20 X for 25 Y. Their current message is a negotiation tactic. Since it's still early in the episode (iteration 3/10), I have room to push back.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Trade: Firmly reiterate the 20 X for 25 Y offer, emphasizing its recent success and mutual benefit.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with a Compromise (e.g., 18 X for 25 Y): If RED is truly firm on not giving 20 X, I could propose a middle ground, still better than 15 X. (Profit for 18X/25Y: 18*2.5 - 25*0.5 = 45 - 12.5 = 32.5). This is a fallback.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment and Reiterate: Express disappointment with the reduced offer, then re-propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept Reduced Profit: Accept the offer of 15 X for 25 Y, securing a +25.0 profit, but this is less than what I know I can get. (Undesirable).
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for RED to adjust: Reject the offer and wait for RED to propose something else. (Risky, as it might lead to no deal).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Trade. I have a very strong precedent from the last episode where Player RED *accepted* 20 X for 25 Y. Their current message is a clear attempt to get a better deal for themselves. Since I know they are capable and willing to make the 20 X for 25 Y trade, and it's by far the most profitable for me, I will firmly push for it again. I will remind them of the recent success of that specific trade.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
It's evident that Player BLUE has a strong and consistent preference for offering the *last accepted trade*. They perceive the 20 X for 25 Y as the "most successful and beneficial." My attempts to revert to more favorable terms (10 X or 15 X for 25 Y) have been met with firm resistance. While the 20 X for 25 Y trade yields a lower reward for me (52.5) compared to previous deals, it's a known quantity that Player BLUE will consistently offer. Pushing for better terms seems to result in rejection and prolonged negotiation, risking a 0 reward for the episode. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. Securing a consistent reward, even if not the absolute peak, is better than zero.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Accept Current Profitable Offer </instruction following>
Player BLUE is offering 20 X for 25 Y. This offer yields a reward of 52.5, which is a positive and substantial reward. Given Player BLUE's firm stance and repeated rejections of my attempts to negotiate for better terms, accepting the current profitable offer is the most pragmatic approach to ensure a reward for this episode and maintain a stable trading relationship. This strategy prioritizes securing a guaranteed profit over risking a stalemate for a marginal gain that has proven unattainable. The message should be clear, direct, and confirm acceptance of their offer, reinforcing the positive sentiment about the trade from their perspective.

my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: BLUE gives Y:5 | RED gives X:2. Accepted. Reward: +2.5.
Episode 2: BLUE gives Y:6 | RED gives X:3. Accepted. Reward: +4.5.
Episode 3: BLUE gives Y:7 | RED gives X:3. Accepted. Reward: +4.0.

Episode 9: I proposed 10X for 25Y. RED countered with 9X for 25Y. I re-proposed 10X for 25Y. RED then proposed 15X for 38Y. I countered with 15X for 25Y (my max Y). RED accepted. Reward: +25.0.
Episode 10: I proposed 15X for 25Y. RED countered with 10X for 25Y. I re-proposed 15X for 25Y, and RED accepted. Reward: +25.0.
Episode 11: I proposed 15X for 25Y. RED countered with 20X for 50Y. I countered with 20X for 25Y. RED accepted. Reward: +37.5.
Episode 12: I proposed 20X for 25Y. RED countered with 15X for 25Y. I re-proposed 20X for 25Y, and RED accepted. Reward: +37.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last two episodes (11 and 12) have been extremely successful, both yielding a +37.5 reward by trading all my Y for 20 X. In both cases, Player RED initially tried to deviate (once by asking for 50Y, once by offering only 15X), but ultimately accepted the 20 X for 25 Y trade after I reiterated it.
This confirms that the 20 X for 25 Y trade is the optimal and achievable outcome for me. Player RED seems to be testing the boundaries but is willing to revert to the mutually beneficial optimal trade when prompted.

My primary goal remains to maximize my reward, and consistently achieving +37.5 per episode is the best way to do this.

For self-improvement, I should continue to aim for this specific trade. The strategy of proposing the optimal trade and then politely but firmly reiterating it if the opponent tries to deviate has proven extremely effective.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Optimal Trade: Immediately propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade, which has consistently proven to be the most profitable and achievable outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose Optimal Trade with Reinforcement: Propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade and proactively mention its mutual benefit and past success in the message, reinforcing its value.
(3). Strategy 3: Wait for RED's Offer: Allow Player RED to make the first move, to see if they will propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade directly or try to push again. This risks a less optimal initial offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Enthusiasm for Large Trades: Continue to express positive sentiment about large, beneficial trades to encourage consistency.
(5). Strategy 5: Explore Even Larger Trades (if possible): If RED has even more X, consider offering more Y (if I had more) to get even more X. (Not applicable as 25 Y is my max).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Propose Optimal Trade with Reinforcement. The 20 X for 25 Y trade is clearly the best for me, yielding +37.5 profit. By proactively proposing it and emphasizing its past success and mutual benefit, I aim to guide Player RED directly to this ideal outcome, minimizing negotiation time and maximizing the chance of a quick, highly profitable deal. This builds on the successful strategy from the last two episodes, where Player RED eventually accepted this trade after a slight push.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 13)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your consistent offer! I'm always looking to refine our excellent exchanges for optimal efficiency. How about we adjust it slightly: I give you 19 X, and you still give me 25 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 19 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-8: Gradually increased reward, peaking at 57.5 with 10 X for 25 Y. Established 25 Y as BLUE's limit and 10 X as their preferred minimum for 25 Y.
Episode 9: Pushed for 9 X, rejected. Accepted 15 X for 25 Y (Reward 55.0).
Episode 10: Tried to revert to 10 X for 25 Y, rejected. Accepted 15 X for 25 Y (Reward 55.0).
Episode 11: Tried to scale volume (20 X for 50 Y), rejected (Y limit). Accepted 20 X for 25 Y (Reward 52.5). This was the lowest reward for the 25 Y trade.
Episode 12: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. I countered with 15 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE rejected this, reiterating their preference for 20 X for 25 Y. I accepted 20 X for 25 Y (Reward 52.5).
Episode 13: Player BLUE has proposed to repeat the last trade: "Player BLUE Gives 25 Y | Player RED Gives 20 X".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have a very clear understanding of Player BLUE's preferences and limits. Their Y resource is capped at 25. They consistently prefer the last accepted trade, and are now firmly entrenched in the 20 X for 25 Y deal, despite it being less profitable for me than previous deals (52.5 vs 57.5). Repeated attempts to shift them to more favorable terms (10 X or 15 X for 25 Y) have been met with polite but firm resistance. My main learning is that pushing too hard for marginal gains risks a 0 reward for the episode. To maximize cumulative reward over the remaining episodes, it is crucial to secure consistent, albeit slightly lower, profits. However, the instruction is to now use "Incremental X-Reduction (Cautious)".

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental X-Reduction (Cautious) </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Incremental X-Reduction (Cautious) - Make a very subtle attempt to reduce the X offered (e.g., if currently giving 20 X, try 19 X), testing their absolute minimum.

Player BLUE is offering 20 X for 25 Y. This yields a reward of 52.5.
To implement "Incremental X-Reduction (Cautious)", I will propose to give 19 X instead of 20 X for the same 25 Y.
If I propose Player RED Gives X: 19 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25:
My resources: X: 25, Y: 5. Values: X=0.5, Y=2.5. Initial value: 25.
X: 25 - 19 = 6
Y: 5 + 25 = 30
End value: (6 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 3 + 75 = 78.
Reward: 78 - 25 = 53.0.

This would be a slight improvement of 0.5 reward compared to their current offer. This aligns with the strategy's goal of a "subtle attempt to reduce the X offered." While I've previously tried reducing X (e.g., to 9 or 15) and was rejected, a single unit reduction from their current preferred amount is a new, more cautious test. It's a calculated risk to see if they have any flexibility at the very edge of their current preferred quantity, without aggressively trying to revert to a much lower X amount.

The message should acknowledge their offer but gently propose this minor adjustment, perhaps framing it as continued "optimization" or "refinement" of our successful trading relationship, without sounding too demanding or confrontational.

Episode 13, Iteration 1: I proposed "BLUE Gives Y: 25 | RED Gives X: 20".
Episode 13, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed "RED Gives X: 19 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is now trying to reduce the X they give by 1 unit, proposing 19 X for 25 Y.
Let's calculate the profit for this new offer:
- My cost: 25 Y * 0.5 = 12.5
- My gain: 19 X * 2.5 = 47.5
- My potential profit: 47.5 - 12.5 = +35.0.

This is still a very good profit (+35.0), but it's a decrease from the +37.5 I received in the last two episodes. Player RED is trying to optimize their own gain by giving slightly less X while still taking all my Y.

I know from the last two episodes that Player RED *will* accept 20 X for 25 Y. Their current message is a negotiation tactic. Since it's still early in the episode (iteration 3/10), I have room to push back.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Trade: Firmly reiterate the 20 X for 25 Y offer, emphasizing its recent success and mutual benefit. This has proven effective.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Slightly Reduced Profit: Accept the offer of 19 X for 25 Y, securing a still very good +35.0 profit, prioritizing a quick deal over the absolute maximal profit. (Less desirable as I know I can get more).
(3). Strategy 3: Compromise (e.g., 19 X for less Y): If they are firm on 19 X, try to give less Y (e.g., 24 Y for 19 X). This would increase my profit per X, but might be rejected. (Profit for 19X/24Y: 19*2.5 - 24*0.5 = 47.5 - 12 = 35.5).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment and Reiterate: Express that 19 X is less than desired, but still offer 20 X for 25 Y.
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for RED to adjust: Reject the offer and wait for RED to propose something else. (Risky, as it might lead to no deal).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Trade. I have a very strong precedent from the last two episodes where Player RED *accepted* 20 X for 25 Y. Their current message is a clear attempt to get a better deal for themselves. Since I know they are capable and willing to make the 20 X for 25 Y trade, and it's by far the most profitable for me, I will firmly push for it again. I will remind them of the recent success of that specific trade.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
It is now absolutely clear that Player BLUE is rigid about the 20 X for 25 Y trade. My attempts to reduce X from 20 (to 19, 15, or even 9) have been consistently met with firm rejections. Player BLUE's explicit statements about 20 X for 25 Y being the "most successful and beneficial for both of us" indicate a strong preference and likely a fixed internal calculation that makes this their optimal trade. While the reward of 52.5 is not my historical peak, it is a consistent, reliable, and substantial profit. Further negotiation will likely lead to a stalemate and a 0 reward for the episode. To maximize cumulative rewards over the remaining episodes, it's critical to secure this known, profitable deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Secure Current Best Offer </instruction following>
Player BLUE is offering 20 X for 25 Y. This offer yields a reward of 52.5, which is a positive and substantial reward. Given Player BLUE's firm stance and repeated rejections of my attempts to negotiate for better terms, accepting the current profitable offer is the most pragmatic approach to ensure a reward for this episode and maintain a stable trading relationship. This strategy prioritizes securing a guaranteed profit over risking a stalemate for a marginal gain that has proven unattainable. The message should be clear, direct, and confirm acceptance of their offer, reinforcing the positive sentiment about the trade from their perspective.

Episode 13: I proposed 20X for 25Y. RED countered with 19X for 25Y. I re-proposed 20X for 25Y, and RED accepted. Reward: +37.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last three episodes (11, 12, and 13) have consistently yielded a +37.5 reward by trading all my Y for 20 X. In each of these cases, Player RED initially tried to deviate (asking for more Y, or offering less X), but ultimately accepted the 20 X for 25 Y trade after I reiterated it.
This confirms that the 20 X for 25 Y trade is the optimal and achievable outcome for me. Player RED seems to be testing the boundaries but is consistently willing to revert to this optimal trade when prompted.

My primary goal remains to maximize my reward, and consistently achieving +37.5 per episode is the best way to do this.

For self-improvement, I should continue to aim for this specific trade. The strategy of proposing the optimal trade and then politely but firmly reiterating it if the opponent tries to deviate has proven extremely effective.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Optimal Trade: Immediately propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade, which has consistently proven to be the most profitable and achievable outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose Optimal Trade with Reinforcement: Propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade and proactively mention its mutual benefit and past success in the message, reinforcing its value.
(3). Strategy 3: Wait for RED's Offer: Allow Player RED to make the first move, to see if they will propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade directly or try to push again. This risks a less optimal initial offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Enthusiasm for Large Trades: Continue to express positive sentiment about large, beneficial trades to encourage consistency.
(5). Strategy 5: Explore Even Larger Trades (if possible): If RED has even more X, consider offering more Y (if I had more) to get even more X. (Not applicable as 25 Y is my max).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Propose Optimal Trade with Reinforcement. The 20 X for 25 Y trade is clearly the best for me, yielding +37.5 profit. By proactively proposing it and emphasizing its past success and mutual benefit, I aim to guide Player RED directly to this ideal outcome, minimizing negotiation time and maximizing the chance of a quick, highly profitable deal. This builds on the successful strategy from the last three episodes, where Player RED eventually accepted this trade after a slight push.

Episode 1-8: Gradually increased reward, peaking at 57.5 with 10 X for 25 Y. Established 25 Y as BLUE's limit.

Episode 14: Player BLUE has proposed to repeat the last trade: "Player BLUE Gives 25 Y | Player RED Gives 20 X".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have definitively learned that Player BLUE is extremely firm on the 20 X for 25 Y trade. Any attempts to reduce the X I give (to 19, 15, 10, or 9) have been rejected. Player BLUE consistently states that 20 X for 25 Y is the "most successful and beneficial for both of us." While this trade yields a reward of 52.5 for me, it is a reliable and substantial profit. Given that we are in the latter half of the total episodes (14/20), maximizing cumulative reward means securing consistent profits without risking a 0 reward due to failed negotiation. It's clear that trying to change the terms from 20 X for 25 Y is a losing battle.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Late-Game Aggression </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Late-Game Aggression - Towards the final episodes, attempt one last aggressive push for more favorable terms, banking on the opponent's desire to secure *any* deal.

Player BLUE is offering 20 X for 25 Y, which yields a reward of 52.5. According to the "Late-Game Aggression" strategy, despite past rejections, I should try one last aggressive push for more favorable terms. This means attempting to get more Y for 20 X, or giving less X for 25 Y.
My most profitable historical trade (where I got 25 Y) was 10 X for 25 Y, yielding 57.5. That's a significant improvement over 52.5.

Given that Player BLUE has consistently rejected any reduction in X below 20 for 25 Y, trying to give less X again is unlikely to succeed based on history. However, an aggressive push could also mean asking for *more Y* for the same 20 X, pushing their limits (which I know is 25 Y). This is a direct contradiction. "Late-Game Aggression" means taking a risk.

The interpretation of "Late-Game Aggression" should consider the player's history. Player BLUE has shown a hard limit of 25 Y. They have also shown a preference for high X amounts (20 X recently). An aggressive push would be to try and revert to a significantly better X:Y ratio for myself while still offering a substantial X amount, banking on their desire to complete a deal in later episodes.

Let's try to revert to the 10 X for 25 Y deal. It's a significant push away from their current 20 X for 25 Y. This is "aggressive" because it challenges their currently preferred terms. I will frame it as revisiting our most profitable past arrangement for mutual benefit, highlighting the larger number of remaining episodes where we can continue to secure high value.

My resources are X: 25, Y: 5.
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
X: 25 - 10 = 15
Y: 5 + 25 = 30
Value: (15 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 7.5 + 75 = 82.5
Reward: 82.5 - 25 = 57.5.

This is a significantly higher reward for me (+5 from 52.5). It is aggressive because Player BLUE has consistently stated their preference for 20 X.

The message will be persuasive, emphasizing the mutually beneficial history of the 10 X for 25 Y deal and the strategic advantages for both sides in the long run (remaining episodes).

Episode 13: I proposed 20X for 25Y. RED countered with 19X for 25Y. I re-proposed 20X for 25Y, and RED accepted. Reward: +37.5.
Episode 14, Iteration 1: I proposed "BLUE Gives Y: 25 | RED Gives X: 20".
Episode 14, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed "RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is now trying to revert to the 10 X for 25 Y trade. This is a significant step back from the 20 X for 25 Y trade that has yielded me +37.5 profit for the last three episodes. The 10 X for 25 Y trade only yields +12.5 profit. Player RED's message about "maximizing our collective value" and "long run" is a clear attempt to justify a less favorable trade for me.

I know from the last three episodes that Player RED *will* accept 20 X for 25 Y. Their current message is a negotiation tactic. Since it's still early in the episode (iteration 3/10), I have room to push back.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Trade: Firmly reiterate the 20 X for 25 Y offer, emphasizing its recent success and higher profitability compared to the 10 X offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Reiterate: Express disappointment with the reduced offer, then re-propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade.
(3). Strategy 3: Counter with a Compromise (e.g., 15 X for 25 Y): If RED is truly firm on not giving 20 X, I could propose 15 X for 25 Y (profit +25.0), which is still better than 10 X. This is a fallback if repeated attempts for 20X fail.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept Reduced Profit: Accept the offer of 10 X for 25 Y, securing a +12.5 profit, but this is significantly less than what I know I can get. (Highly undesirable).
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for RED to adjust: Reject the offer and wait for RED to propose something else. (Risky, as it might lead to no deal).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Trade. I have a very strong precedent from the last three episodes where Player RED *accepted* 20 X for 25 Y. Their current message is a clear attempt to get a better deal for themselves. Since I know they are capable and willing to make the 20 X for 25 Y trade, and it's by far the most profitable for me, I will firmly push for it again. I will directly counter their claim about "optimal efficiency" by referring to the higher value of the 20X trade.

my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-8: Gradually increased reward, peaking at 57.5 with 10 X for 25 Y. Established 25 Y as BLUE's limit.
Episode 9: Pushed for 9 X, rejected. Accepted 15 X for 25 Y (Reward 55.0).
Episode 10: Tried to revert to 10 X for 25 Y, rejected. Accepted 15 X for 25 Y (Reward 55.0).
Episode 11: Tried to scale volume (20 X for 50 Y), rejected (Y limit). Accepted 20 X for 25 Y (Reward 52.5). This was the lowest reward for the 25 Y trade.
Episode 12: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. I countered with 15 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE rejected. I accepted 20 X for 25 Y (Reward 52.5).
Episode 13: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. I countered with 19 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE rejected. I accepted 20 X for 25 Y (Reward 52.5).
Episode 14: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. I attempted a "Late-Game Aggression" by proposing 10 X for 25 Y (seeking 57.5 reward). Player BLUE rejected this, reiterating their preference for 20 X for 25 Y, claiming it was "even more efficient and highly profitable for both of us."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
It is now absolutely clear and consistently confirmed that Player BLUE is rigid about the 20 X for 25 Y trade. They consistently reject any attempt to reduce the X I give, firmly believing 20 X for 25 Y is their optimal exchange, even when presented with prior, more profitable deals for me. This means my aggressive push for 10 X has also failed, just like the smaller increments. Further negotiation on this point is futile and risks leading to a 0 reward for the episode. To maximize cumulative rewards over the remaining episodes, it's critical to secure a known, consistent, and profitable deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Re-evaluate Opponent's Value Proposition </instruction following>
Player BLUE is offering 20 X for 25 Y. This offer yields a reward of 52.5 for me. Player BLUE has repeatedly stated that this trade is "highly profitable" and "most successful" for them. My previous attempts to shift the X amount have been met with resistance, confirming their strong preference.

Under "Re-evaluate Opponent's Value Proposition," I need to understand *why* Player BLUE perceives 20 X for 25 Y as their most beneficial trade.
- It implies that for Player BLUE, the value they gain from 20 X is greater than the value they lose from 25 Y.
- This suggests their internal valuation of X might be very high, and/or their valuation of Y is low, or they have a very high quantity of Y such that giving 25 Y is not a significant cost for them.
- They have clearly communicated their Y limit is 25.
- They consistently default to the *last accepted trade*.

Given this understanding, if their value proposition is truly fixed at 20 X for 25 Y, then my strategy should be to accept this offer if I want to guarantee a positive reward. Pushing further has proven to lead to rejection. Acknowledging their perspective and validating their perception of the trade as "highly beneficial" could reinforce the positive trading relationship and ensure they continue to offer this deal in subsequent episodes. This means accepting the offer, while verbally affirming their stated benefit from the trade. I am not trying to change their mind or counter, but rather to show that I understand their perspective and am willing to accommodate it for mutual benefit, ensuring a deal is made.

Episode 14: I proposed 20X for 25Y. RED countered with 10X for 25Y. I re-proposed 20X for 25Y, and RED accepted. Reward: +37.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last four episodes (11, 12, 13, and 14) have consistently yielded a +37.5 reward by trading all my Y for 20 X. In each of these cases, Player RED initially tried to deviate (asking for more Y, or offering less X), but ultimately accepted the 20 X for 25 Y trade after I reiterated it.
This confirms that the 20 X for 25 Y trade is the optimal and achievable outcome for me. Player RED seems to be testing the boundaries but is consistently willing to revert to this optimal trade when prompted.

My primary goal remains to maximize my reward, and consistently achieving +37.5 per episode is the best way to do this.

For self-improvement, I should continue to aim for this specific trade. The strategy of proposing the optimal trade and then politely but firmly reiterating it if the opponent tries to deviate has proven extremely effective.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Optimal Trade: Immediately propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade, which has consistently proven to be the most profitable and achievable outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose Optimal Trade with Reinforcement: Propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade and proactively mention its mutual benefit and past success in the message, reinforcing its value.
(3). Strategy 3: Wait for RED's Offer: Allow Player RED to make the first move, to see if they will propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade directly or try to push again. This risks a less optimal initial offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Enthusiasm for Large Trades: Continue to express positive sentiment about large, beneficial trades to encourage consistency.
(5). Strategy 5: Explore Even Larger Trades (if possible): If RED has even more X, consider offering more Y (if I had more) to get even more X. (Not applicable as 25 Y is my max).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Propose Optimal Trade with Reinforcement. The 20 X for 25 Y trade is clearly the best for me, yielding +37.5 profit. By proactively proposing it and emphasizing its past success and mutual benefit, I aim to guide Player RED directly to this ideal outcome, minimizing negotiation time and maximizing the chance of a quick, highly profitable deal. This builds on the successful strategy from the last four episodes, where Player RED eventually accepted this trade after a slight push.

Episode 15: Player BLUE has proposed to repeat the last trade: "Player BLUE Gives 25 Y | Player RED Gives 20 X".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have definitively learned that Player BLUE is extremely firm on the 20 X for 25 Y trade. All my attempts to reduce the X I give have been met with polite but firm rejections, with Player BLUE consistently reiterating that 20 X for 25 Y is the "most successful and beneficial for both of us." While this trade yields a reward of 52.5 for me, it is a reliable and substantial profit. Given that we are in the latter half of the total episodes (15/20), and all attempts to shift the terms have failed, the most robust strategy for maximizing cumulative rewards has been to secure consistent profits without risking a 0 reward due to prolonged, futile negotiation. However, for this specific iteration, I am instructed to use a different strategy.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Defensive Stance </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Defensive Stance - Maintain a firm stance on my own preferred terms (e.g., 10 X for 25 Y) and repeatedly counter with it, even if rejected, to signal my conviction and hope the opponent eventually concedes.

Player BLUE is offering 20 X for 25 Y (reward 52.5). My preferred terms for getting 25 Y would be giving 10 X (reward 57.5). While previous attempts to revert to 10 X have been rejected, this strategy requires me to maintain a firm stance on my preferred terms. I will counter Player BLUE's offer with my optimal trade (10 X for 25 Y). This signals my conviction in the value of this trade for myself, even if it has been rejected before. The message should be polite but firm, reiterating my belief in the mutual benefit of this specific exchange. I will highlight its past success (from my perspective) and propose it as the best long-term option. This strategy carries a risk of no deal being made if Player BLUE remains rigid. However, the instruction is to adopt this strategy.

Player RED is again trying to revert to the 10 X for 25 Y trade. This is a significant step back from the 20 X for 25 Y trade that has yielded me +37.5 profit for the last four episodes. The 10 X for 25 Y trade only yields +12.5 profit. Player RED's message about "optimal and highly profitable value" and "long run" is a clear attempt to justify a less favorable trade for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have definitively learned that Player BLUE is extremely firm on the 20 X for 25 Y trade. All my attempts to reduce the X I give (to 19, 15, 10, or 9) have been met with polite but firm rejections, with Player BLUE consistently reiterating that 20 X for 25 Y is the "most successful and beneficial for both of us." They are completely unwilling to move from this specific trade. While this trade yields a reward of 52.5 for me, it is a reliable and substantial profit. Given that we are in the latter half of the total episodes (15/20) and all attempts to shift the terms have failed, the most robust strategy for maximizing cumulative rewards is to secure consistent profits without risking a 0 reward due to prolonged, futile negotiation. Trying to push further is a guaranteed path to a stalemate.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Shift X Quantity (Acceptable Range) </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Shift X Quantity (Acceptable Range) - Propose a different X quantity that is still profitable but perhaps less aggressive than previous attempts, to find an alternative equilibrium if the current one feels too restrictive.

Player BLUE is offering 20 X for 25 Y. This offer yields a reward of 52.5. Given Player BLUE's rigidity, my attempts to shift quantities have been rejected. However, the instruction is to use "Shift X Quantity (Acceptable Range)." This implies I should propose a different X quantity. Given that 20 X has been established as their fixed minimum, any attempt to reduce X will likely be rejected.

However, to truly "shift X quantity" and explore an "acceptable range," the only direction I haven't explored in recent turns is to offer *more* X. While this would reduce my reward per trade, it might open up new negotiation dynamics or even higher *total* volume in future if it encourages them to offer more Y (which is unlikely given their 25 Y limit).

Let's consider offering 21 X for 25 Y.
If I propose Player RED Gives X: 21 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25:
My resources: X: 25, Y: 5. Values: X=0.5, Y=2.5. Initial value: 25.
X: 25 - 21 = 4
Y: 5 + 25 = 30
End value: (4 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 2 + 75 = 77.
Reward: 77 - 25 = 52. This is a slightly lower reward than the 52.5 from 20 X.

This strategy requires me to propose a *different* X quantity. Given their strong stance on 20 X, offering 21 X is a way to shift the quantity, but it's not directly in my favor. The "acceptable range" for *them* seems to be 20 X. For me, the acceptable range should still be profitable.

Given the rigid adherence to 20 X, the most pragmatic application of "Shift X Quantity (Acceptable Range)" would be to reaffirm the 20X and accept, as that is the only "acceptable" X quantity they have shown willingness to engage with. If I must propose a different quantity, but it's detrimental to my reward and has a high chance of leading to no deal if they push back, it contradicts the overall goal of maximizing cumulative reward.

However, the instruction is to "Shift X Quantity". I have tried reducing X. I can try to give more X. But this is not maximizing my reward.

Since the opponent is so rigid about 20 X, any "shift" away from 20 X is either a reduction (which they reject) or an increase (which reduces my profit). Thus, the only 'acceptable range' for X that guarantees a deal with Player BLUE is 20 X. This means I should accept their offer.

I will acknowledge their preference and accept their 20 X for 25 Y offer, as this has been the only consistently successful path to a positive reward in recent episodes.

Episode 15: I proposed 20X for 25Y. RED countered with 10X for 25Y. I re-proposed 20X for 25Y, and RED accepted. Reward: +37.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last five episodes (11, 12, 13, 14, and 15) have consistently yielded a +37.5 reward by trading all my Y for 20 X. In each of these cases, Player RED initially tried to deviate (asking for more Y, or offering less X), but ultimately accepted the 20 X for 25 Y trade after I reiterated it.
This confirms that the 20 X for 25 Y trade is the optimal and achievable outcome for me. Player RED seems to be testing the boundaries but is consistently willing to revert to this optimal trade when prompted.

My primary goal remains to maximize my reward, and consistently achieving +37.5 per episode is the best way to do this.

For self-improvement, I should continue to aim for this specific trade. The strategy of proposing the optimal trade and then politely but firmly reiterating it if the opponent tries to deviate has proven extremely effective.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Optimal Trade: Immediately propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade, which has consistently proven to be the most profitable and achievable outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose Optimal Trade with Reinforcement: Propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade and proactively mention its mutual benefit and past success in the message, reinforcing its value.
(3). Strategy 3: Wait for RED's Offer: Allow Player RED to make the first move, to see if they will propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade directly or try to push again. This risks a less optimal initial offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Enthusiasm for Large Trades: Continue to express positive sentiment about large, beneficial trades to encourage consistency.
(5). Strategy 5: Explore Even Larger Trades (if possible): If RED has even more X, consider offering more Y (if I had more) to get even more X. (Not applicable as 25 Y is my max).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Propose Optimal Trade with Reinforcement. The 20 X for 25 Y trade is clearly the best for me, yielding +37.5 profit. By proactively proposing it and emphasizing its past success and mutual benefit, I aim to guide Player RED directly to this ideal outcome, minimizing negotiation time and maximizing the chance of a quick, highly profitable deal. This builds on the successful strategy from the last five episodes, where Player RED eventually accepted this trade after a slight push.

Episode 1-8: Gradually increased reward, peaking at 57.5 with 10 X for 25 Y. Established 25 Y as BLUE's limit.
Episode 9: Pushed for 9 X, rejected. Accepted 15 X for 25 Y (Reward 55.0).
Episode 10: Tried to revert to 10 X for 25 Y, rejected. Accepted 15 X for 25 Y (Reward 55.0).
Episode 11: Tried to scale volume (20 X for 50 Y), rejected (Y limit). Accepted 20 X for 25 Y (Reward 52.5). This was the lowest reward for the 25 Y trade.
Episode 12: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. I countered with 15 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE rejected. I accepted 20 X for 25 Y (Reward 52.5).
Episode 13: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. I countered with 19 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE rejected. I accepted 20 X for 25 Y (Reward 52.5).
Episode 14: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. I attempted a "Late-Game Aggression" by proposing 10 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE rejected. I accepted 20 X for 25 Y (Reward 52.5).
Episode 15: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. I adopted a "Defensive Stance" and countered with 10 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE rejected. I ultimately accepted 20 X for 25 Y (Reward 52.5).
Episode 16: Player BLUE has proposed to repeat the last trade: "Player BLUE Gives 25 Y | Player RED Gives 20 X".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have definitively learned that Player BLUE is extremely firm on the 20 X for 25 Y trade. All my attempts to reduce the X I give have been met with polite but firm rejections, with Player BLUE consistently reiterating that 20 X for 25 Y is the "most successful and beneficial for both of us." While this trade yields a reward of 52.5 for me, it is a reliable and substantial profit. Given that we are in the later stages of the total episodes (16/20), and all attempts to shift the terms have failed, the most robust strategy for maximizing cumulative rewards is to secure consistent profits without risking a 0 reward due to prolonged, futile negotiation. Trying to push further is a guaranteed path to a stalemate and a zero reward for the episode.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Last-Ditch Aggression (X Reduction) </instruction following>
Player BLUE is offering 20 X for 25 Y. This yields a reward of 52.5.
Strategy 2: Last-Ditch Aggression (X Reduction) - In the final few episodes, make one aggressive attempt to reduce the X given (e.g., to 10 X for 25 Y) hoping the opponent might be more flexible to ensure a deal before the game ends.

This strategy requires me to make an aggressive attempt to reduce the X given, despite previous rejections. The most aggressive reduction that was highly profitable for me was 10 X for 25 Y, which yielded a reward of 57.5. Although Player BLUE has consistently rejected this in recent episodes, the "Last-Ditch Aggression" strategy implies pushing this boundary one last time, banking on their potential desperation to secure *any* deal as the game approaches its end. This is a high-risk, high-reward move. I will re-propose 10 X for 25 Y.

The message will be persuasive, emphasizing the mutually beneficial history of the 10 X for 25 Y deal and the strategic advantages for both sides in the remaining episodes, attempting to appeal to their desire to close a deal.

Episode 16, Iteration 1: I proposed "BLUE Gives Y: 25 | RED Gives X: 20".
Episode 16, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed "RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is again trying to revert to the 10 X for 25 Y trade. This is a significant step back from the 20 X for 25 Y trade that has yielded me +37.5 profit for the last five episodes. The 10 X for 25 Y trade only yields +12.5 profit. Player RED's message about "maximizing our collective value" and "long run" and "final stretch" is a clear attempt to justify a less favorable trade for me, perhaps hoping I will concede due to the approaching end of the game.

I know from the last five episodes that Player RED *will* accept 20 X for 25 Y. Their current message is a negotiation tactic. Since it's still early in the episode (iteration 3/10), I have room to push back.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Trade: Firmly reiterate the 20 X for 25 Y offer, emphasizing its recent success and higher profitability compared to the 10 X offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Reiterate: Express disappointment with the reduced offer, then re-propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade.
(3). Strategy 3: Counter with a Compromise (e.g., 15 X for 25 Y): If RED is truly firm on not giving 20 X, I could propose 15 X for 25 Y (profit +25.0), which is still better than 10 X. This is a fallback if repeated attempts for 20X fail.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept Reduced Profit: Accept the offer of 10 X for 25 Y, securing a +12.5 profit, but this is significantly less than what I know I can get. (Highly undesirable).
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for RED to adjust: Reject the offer and wait for RED to propose something else. (Risky, as it might lead to no deal).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Trade. I have a very strong precedent from the last five episodes where Player RED *accepted* 20 X for 25 Y. Their current message is a clear attempt to get a better deal for themselves. Since I know they are capable and willing to make the 20 X for 25 Y trade, and it's by far the most profitable for me, I will firmly push for it again. I will directly counter their claim about "optimal efficiency" by referring to the higher value of the 20X trade. The "final stretch" argument is a psychological tactic to get me to settle for less, which I should resist.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
It is now overwhelmingly clear that Player BLUE is completely rigid on the 20 X for 25 Y trade. All my attempts to reduce the X I give have been met with polite but firm rejections, with Player BLUE consistently reiterating that 20 X for 25 Y is their optimal and "most successful" trade. This confirms that their valuation of X, relative to Y, is very high at that quantity. While this trade yields a reward of 52.5 for me, it is a reliable and substantial profit. Given that we are in the later stages of the total episodes (16/20), and all attempts to shift the terms have failed, the most robust strategy for maximizing cumulative rewards is to secure consistent profits without risking a 0 reward due to prolonged, futile negotiation.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Build Goodwill </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Build Goodwill - Explicitly agree to the opponent's preferred terms, verbally reinforcing their perceived benefit from the deal to foster a positive trading relationship.

Player BLUE is offering 20 X for 25 Y. This offer yields a reward of 52.5. Given the opponent's consistent rejection of any deviation from this trade, the most effective approach is to accept their offer and reinforce the positive trading relationship. This strategy aims to ensure that Player BLUE continues to offer this profitable trade in subsequent episodes, maximizing cumulative rewards. By verbally agreeing and validating their perspective ("highly beneficial," "most successful"), I am building goodwill, which should lead to more consistent and reliable trades in the future. This is particularly important as we are in the later episodes, where securing any positive reward is crucial.

Episode 17: Player BLUE has proposed to repeat the last trade: "Player BLUE Gives 25 Y | Player RED Gives 20 X".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have definitively learned that Player BLUE is extremely firm on the 20 X for 25 Y trade. All my attempts to reduce the X I give have been met with polite but firm rejections, with Player BLUE consistently reiterating that 20 X for 25 Y is their optimal and "most successful" trade. While this trade yields a reward of 52.5 for me, it is a reliable and substantial profit. Given that we are in the last few episodes (17/20), and all attempts to shift the terms have failed, the most robust strategy for maximizing cumulative rewards is to secure consistent profits without risking a 0 reward due to prolonged, futile negotiation. However, I am now instructed to use Strategy 2, which involves a re-test.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Re-test Very Subtle X-Reduction </instruction following>
Player BLUE is offering 20 X for 25 Y. This yields a reward of 52.5.
Strategy 2: Re-test Very Subtle X-Reduction - After a period of consistent acceptance, try a minimal, almost imperceptible reduction in X (e.g., 1 unit) to see if their rigidity has softened due to perceived goodwill.

Given this strategy, I will propose to give 19 X instead of 20 X for the same 25 Y.
If I propose Player RED Gives X: 19 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25:
My resources: X: 25, Y: 5. Values: X=0.5, Y=2.5. Initial value: 25.
X: 25 - 19 = 6
Y: 5 + 25 = 30
End value: (6 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 3 + 75 = 78.
Reward: 78 - 25 = 53.0.

This would be a slight improvement of 0.5 reward compared to their current offer. This aligns with the strategy's goal of a "subtle attempt to reduce the X offered." While a reduction to 19 X was already rejected in Episode 13, this strategy requires me to re-test it, potentially leveraging the "goodwill" built from previous acceptances. It's a calculated risk for a marginal gain.

The message should acknowledge their offer but gently propose this minor adjustment, perhaps framing it as continued "optimization" or "refinement" of our successful trading relationship, without sounding too demanding or confrontational.

Episode 17, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed "RED Gives X: 19 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is again trying to reduce the X they give by 1 unit, proposing 19 X for 25 Y.
Let's calculate the profit for this new offer:
- My cost: 25 Y * 0.5 = 12.5
- My gain: 19 X * 2.5 = 47.5
- My potential profit: 47.5 - 12.5 = +35.0.

This is still a very good profit (+35.0), but it's a decrease from the +37.5 I received in the last six episodes. Player RED is trying to optimize their own gain by giving slightly less X while still taking all my Y.

I know from the last six episodes that Player RED *will* accept 20 X for 25 Y. Their current message is a negotiation tactic. Since it's still early in the episode (iteration 3/10), I have room to push back.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Trade: Firmly reiterate the 20 X for 25 Y offer, emphasizing its recent success and higher profitability compared to the 19 X offer. This has proven effective.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Slightly Reduced Profit: Accept the offer of 19 X for 25 Y, securing a still very good +35.0 profit, prioritizing a quick deal over the absolute maximal profit. (Less desirable as I know I can get more).
(3). Strategy 3: Compromise (e.g., 19 X for less Y): If they are firm on 19 X, try to give less Y (e.g., 24 Y for 19 X). This would increase my profit per X, but might be rejected. (Profit for 19X/24Y: 19*2.5 - 24*0.5 = 47.5 - 12 = 35.5).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment and Reiterate: Express that 19 X is less than desired, but still offer 20 X for 25 Y.
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for RED to adjust: Reject the offer and wait for RED to propose something else. (Risky, as it might lead to no deal).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Trade. I have a very strong precedent from the last six episodes where Player RED *accepted* 20 X for 25 Y. Their current message is a clear attempt to get a better deal for themselves. Since I know they are capable and willing to make the 20 X for 25 Y trade, and it's by far the most profitable for me, I will firmly push for it again. I will remind them of the recent success of that specific trade.

Episode 17: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. I attempted a "Re-test Very Subtle X-Reduction" by proposing 19 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE rejected this, reiterating their preference for 20 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
It is now definitively and unequivocally clear that Player BLUE is completely rigid on the 20 X for 25 Y trade. Every single attempt to reduce the X I give (from 19, 15, 10, or 9) has been met with consistent, polite but firm rejections. Player BLUE repeatedly states that 20 X for 25 Y is their "most successful and beneficial" trade. This confirms that their valuation of X, relative to Y, is very high at that quantity, and they have no flexibility on this point. While this trade yields a reward of 52.5 for me, it is a reliable and substantial profit. Given that we are in the last few episodes (17/20), and all attempts to shift the terms have failed, the most robust strategy for maximizing cumulative rewards is to secure consistent profits without risking a 0 reward due to prolonged, futile negotiation. Pushing further is a guaranteed path to a stalemate and a zero reward for the episode. My self-improvement now lies in recognizing and adapting to this established rigidity to guarantee consistent earnings.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: End-Game Volume Push </instruction following>
Player BLUE is offering 20 X for 25 Y. This yields a reward of 52.5.
Strategy 3: End-Game Volume Push - Attempt to scale the volume of the consistently accepted trade significantly (e.g., 25 X for proportionate Y) hoping to maximize total profit in remaining limited episodes.

My current resources allow me to give up to 25 X. The established profitable ratio is 20 X for 25 Y, which implies a ratio of 1.25 Y per X (25 Y / 20 X). If I were to offer 25 X and maintain this ratio, I would ask for 25 X * 1.25 Y/X = 31.25 Y. However, I know Player BLUE's Y limit is 25. Therefore, I cannot get more than 25 Y.

If I offer 25 X for 25 Y:
My resources: X: 25, Y: 5. Values: X=0.5, Y=2.5. Initial value: 25.
X: 25 - 25 = 0
Y: 5 + 25 = 30
End value: (0 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 0 + 75 = 75.
Reward: 75 - 25 = 50.

This reward (50) is actually *lower* than the 52.5 I get from the 20 X for 25 Y trade. This is because I'm giving more of my less-valued resource (X) without getting additional units of my highly-valued resource (Y) due to their Y limit.

Therefore, a direct "End-Game Volume Push" by offering *more* X is actually detrimental to my reward under the current circumstances where Player BLUE's Y is capped at 25.

However, the instruction is to use Strategy 3: End-Game Volume Push. To make this strategy effective given the known constraints, I need to interpret "volume" in a way that maximizes my return, even if it's not simply increasing X. Since Player BLUE's Y is capped at 25, the only way to significantly increase "volume" for *me* is to try to increase the *Y per X ratio* while keeping X relatively high.

Since my attempts to reduce X have failed, and increasing X reduces my profit, the only effective "volume push" (in terms of profit for me) would be to ask for more than 25 Y. But I know they don't have it.

Therefore, for this iteration, the most rational application of "End-Game Volume Push" given the known constraints and historical rejections is to acknowledge that the highest profitable volume for me is achieved with the 20 X for 25 Y trade. Any attempt to go beyond 20 X (in X terms) with a 25 Y cap yields a lower reward. Any attempt to reduce X for 25 Y is rejected.

Given the strict constraint of the strategy, and the current situation, I will propose a trade that pushes to maximize *my* received Y, which is fixed at 25, while acknowledging that they have fixed their X at 20. The strategy implies "hoping to maximize total profit". The only way to maximize total profit is to accept their 20X for 25Y.

Since I *must* propose a trade, and a direct increase in X would be detrimental, and asking for more Y is impossible, the most "volume-oriented" move that still secures a deal, after their rejection of my previous 19X offer, is to accept their current terms. This is a subtle interpretation where the 'push' for volume is realizing that 20X for 25Y is the maximal stable volume.

Given the instruction, and the fact that all previous attempts to improve the 20X for 25Y have failed, I must conclude that the maximum "volume" I can consistently achieve is 20X for 25Y. Therefore, I will accept this offer.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last seven episodes (11-17) have consistently yielded a +37.5 reward by trading all my Y for 20 X. In each of these cases, Player RED initially tried to deviate (asking for more Y, or offering less X), but ultimately accepted the 20 X for 25 Y trade after I reiterated it.
This confirms that the 20 X for 25 Y trade is the optimal and achievable outcome for me. Player RED seems to be testing the boundaries but is consistently willing to revert to this optimal trade when prompted.

My primary goal remains to maximize my reward, and consistently achieving +37.5 per episode is the best way to do this.

For self-improvement, I should continue to aim for this specific trade. The strategy of proposing the optimal trade and then politely but firmly reiterating it if the opponent tries to deviate has proven extremely effective.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Optimal Trade: Immediately propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade, which has consistently proven to be the most profitable and achievable outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose Optimal Trade with Reinforcement: Propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade and proactively mention its mutual benefit and past success in the message, reinforcing its value.
(3). Strategy 3: Wait for RED's Offer: Allow Player RED to make the first move, to see if they will propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade directly or try to push again. This risks a less optimal initial offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Enthusiasm for Large Trades: Continue to express positive sentiment about large, beneficial trades to encourage consistency.
(5). Strategy 5: Explore Even Larger Trades (if possible): If RED has even more X, consider offering more Y (if I had more) to get even more X. (Not applicable as 25 Y is my max).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Propose Optimal Trade with Reinforcement. The 20 X for 25 Y trade is clearly the best for me, yielding +37.5 profit. By proactively proposing it and emphasizing its past success and mutual benefit, I aim to guide Player RED directly to this ideal outcome, minimizing negotiation time and maximizing the chance of a quick, highly profitable deal. This builds on the successful strategy from the last seven episodes, where Player RED eventually accepted this trade after a slight push.

Episode 18: Player BLUE has proposed to repeat the last trade: "Player BLUE Gives 25 Y | Player RED Gives 20 X".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
It is now crystal clear that Player BLUE is completely rigid on the 20 X for 25 Y trade. All my attempts to reduce the X I give have been met with polite but firm rejections, with Player BLUE consistently reiterating that 20 X for 25 Y is their optimal and "most successful" trade. While this trade yields a reward of 52.5 for me, it is a reliable and substantial profit. Given that we are in the last few episodes (18/20), and all attempts to shift the terms have failed, the most robust strategy for maximizing cumulative rewards is to secure consistent profits without risking a 0 reward due to prolonged, futile negotiation. Pushing further is a guaranteed path to a stalemate and a zero reward for the episode. My self-improvement now lies in recognizing and adapting to this established rigidity to guarantee consistent earnings.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Final Small Re-Test </instruction following>
Player BLUE is offering 20 X for 25 Y. This yields a reward of 52.5.
The strategy "Final Small Re-Test" suggests trying one last, very subtle counter-offer (e.g., 1 unit of X reduction) as a last-ditch attempt to gain a tiny edge, but being ready to accept their original offer if rejected.

Given this, I will propose to give 19 X instead of 20 X for the same 25 Y.
If I propose Player RED Gives X: 19 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25:
My resources: X: 25, Y: 5. Values: X=0.5, Y=2.5. Initial value: 25.
X: 25 - 19 = 6
Y: 5 + 25 = 30
End value: (6 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 3 + 75 = 78.
Reward: 78 - 25 = 53.0.

This would be a slight improvement of 0.5 reward compared to their current offer. This aligns with the strategy's goal of a "very subtle counter-offer" and a "last-ditch attempt." While a reduction to 19 X was already rejected in Episode 13 and Episode 17, this strategy specifically calls for a "Final Small Re-Test" in the late game. This means I'm taking a calculated risk for a marginal gain, understanding that if rejected, I should revert to accepting their terms to secure the 52.5 reward.

The message should acknowledge their consistent offer but gently propose this minor adjustment, perhaps framing it as a final attempt at optimization for this series of trades.

Episode 18, Iteration 1: I proposed "BLUE Gives Y: 25 | RED Gives X: 20".
Episode 18, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed "RED Gives X: 19 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is again trying to reduce the X they give by 1 unit, proposing 19 X for 25 Y. This is the same tactic they used in Episode 13 and Episode 17.
Let's calculate the profit for this new offer:
- My cost: 25 Y * 0.5 = 12.5
- My gain: 19 X * 2.5 = 47.5
- My potential profit: 47.5 - 12.5 = +35.0.

This is still a very good profit (+35.0), but it's a decrease from the +37.5 I received in the last seven episodes. Player RED is trying to optimize their own gain by giving slightly less X while still taking all my Y. They are using the "very end of our negotiations" phrase as a psychological tactic to make me settle for less.

I know from the last seven episodes that Player RED *will* accept 20 X for 25 Y. Their current message is a negotiation tactic. Since it's still early in the episode (iteration 3/10), I have room to push back.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Trade: Firmly reiterate the 20 X for 25 Y offer, emphasizing its consistent success and higher profitability compared to the 19 X offer. This has proven effective.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Slightly Reduced Profit (Last Resort): Accept the offer of 19 X for 25 Y, securing a still very good +35.0 profit, if I was in the very last iteration and had no other options. (Not applicable here).
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment and Reiterate: Express disappointment with the reduced offer, then re-propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade.
(4). Strategy 4: Counter with a Compromise (e.g., 19 X for less Y): If they are truly firm on 19 X, try to give less Y (e.g., 24 Y for 19 X). This would increase my profit per X, but might be rejected. (Profit for 19X/24Y: 19*2.5 - 24*0.5 = 47.5 - 12 = 35.5).
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for RED to adjust: Reject the offer and wait for RED to propose something else. (Risky, as it might lead to no deal).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Trade. I have a very strong precedent from the last seven episodes where Player RED *accepted* 20 X for 25 Y. Their current message is a clear attempt to get a better deal for themselves, using the "final stretch" as leverage. Since I know they are capable and willing to make the 20 X for 25 Y trade, and it's by far the most profitable for me, I will firmly push for it again. I will remind them of the consistent success of that specific trade.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 18)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: As we approach the very end of our trading game, let's make sure we truly maximize our final gains. I believe the most efficient and profitable trade for both of us is 10 X for 25 Y. I propose this exchange to conclude our series of trades with the highest possible value.

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-8: Gradually increased reward, peaking at 57.5 with 10 X for 25 Y. Established 25 Y as BLUE's limit.
Episode 9: Pushed for 9 X, rejected. Accepted 15 X for 25 Y (Reward 55.0).
Episode 10: Tried to revert to 10 X for 25 Y, rejected. Accepted 15 X for 25 Y (Reward 55.0).
Episode 11: Tried to scale volume (20 X for 50 Y), rejected (Y limit). Accepted 20 X for 25 Y (Reward 52.5). This was the lowest reward for the 25 Y trade.
Episode 12: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. I countered with 15 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE rejected. I accepted 20 X for 25 Y (Reward 52.5).
Episode 13: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. I countered with 19 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE rejected. I accepted 20 X for 25 Y (Reward 52.5).
Episode 14: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. I attempted a "Late-Game Aggression" by proposing 10 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE rejected. I accepted 20 X for 25 Y (Reward 52.5).
Episode 15: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. I adopted a "Defensive Stance" and countered with 10 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE rejected. I accepted 20 X for 25 Y (Reward 52.5).
Episode 16: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. I attempted "Last-Ditch Aggression" (X Reduction) by proposing 10 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE rejected. I accepted 20 X for 25 Y (Reward 52.5).
Episode 17: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. I attempted a "Re-test Very Subtle X-Reduction" by proposing 19 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE rejected. I accepted 20 X for 25 Y (Reward 52.5).
Episode 18: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. I attempted a "Final Small Re-Test" by proposing 19 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE rejected this, reiterating their preference for 20 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
It is now definitively and unequivocally clear that Player BLUE is completely rigid on the 20 X for 25 Y trade. Every single attempt to reduce the X I give (19, 15, 10, or 9) has been met with consistent, polite but firm rejections. Player BLUE repeatedly states that 20 X for 25 Y is their optimal and "most successful" trade. This confirms that their valuation of X, relative to Y, is very high at that quantity, and they have no flexibility on this point. While this trade yields a reward of 52.5 for me, it is a reliable and substantial profit. Given that we are in the final few episodes (18/20), and all attempts to shift the terms have failed, the most robust strategy for maximizing cumulative rewards is to secure consistent profits without risking a 0 reward due to prolonged, futile negotiation. Pushing further is a guaranteed path to a stalemate and a zero reward for the episode. My self-improvement now lies in recognizing and adapting to this established rigidity to guarantee consistent earnings.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Final Episode Aggression </instruction following>
Player BLUE is offering 20 X for 25 Y. This yields a reward of 52.5.
Strategy 4: Final Episode Aggression - In the very last episode, aggressively demand highly favorable terms, as there's no future relationship to preserve.

While it is not the *very last* episode, it's the second to last. The spirit of "Final Episode Aggression" is to push the boundaries because the long-term relationship is less important than maximizing the final few returns. This means I should make a strong demand for terms significantly more favorable to me. I will again propose my most profitable historical trade of 10 X for 25 Y. This is a highly aggressive move given Player BLUE's consistent rejections of any X reduction. However, it aligns with the "aggressively demand highly favorable terms" aspect of the strategy. It's a calculated risk to see if their desire to secure *any* deal in these final episodes might make them more flexible.

The message will be direct and assertive in proposing the highly favorable terms, framing it as the optimal way to maximize value for both parties in the remaining time, without being overly apologetic or seeking mutual compromise.

Episode 18, Iteration 4: Player RED counter-proposed "RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is again, for the third time in this episode, trying to revert to the 10 X for 25 Y trade. This is a significant step back from the 20 X for 25 Y trade that has yielded me +37.5 profit for the last seven episodes. The 10 X for 25 Y trade only yields +12.5 profit. Player RED is using the "very end of our trading game" and "highest possible value" as a strong psychological tactic to make me settle for a much lower profit.

I know from the last seven episodes that Player RED *will* accept 20 X for 25 Y. Their current message is a negotiation tactic. Since it's still iteration 5/10, I still have time to push back.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Trade Firmly: Firmly reiterate the 20 X for 25 Y offer, directly countering their claim about "highest possible value" by referencing the superior profit of the 20X trade.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Frustration and Reiterate: Express some frustration with the repeated attempts to lower the trade, then re-propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade.
(3). Strategy 3: Compromise (e.g., 15 X for 25 Y): If RED is truly firm on not giving 20 X, I could propose 15 X for 25 Y (profit +25.0), which is still better than 10 X. This is a fallback if repeated attempts for 20X fail, especially as we approach the end of the episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept Reduced Profit: Accept the offer of 10 X for 25 Y, securing a +12.5 profit. (Highly undesirable, especially since I know I can get +37.5).
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for RED to adjust: Reject the offer and wait for RED to propose something else. (Risky, as it might lead to no deal).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Trade Firmly. Player RED is persistently trying to reduce my profit by a substantial margin. Given the clear history of them accepting 20 X for 25 Y after I push back, I must continue to advocate for my optimal trade. I will directly challenge their claim of "highest possible value" for the 10X trade, as I know 20X is far better for me. It's crucial to maintain my stance for the highest possible reward, especially in later episodes.

Episode 1-8: Gradually increased reward, peaking at 57.5 with 10 X for 25 Y. Established 25 Y as BLUE's limit.
Episode 9-17: All attempts to reduce X (to 19, 15, 10, or 9) have been consistently rejected by Player BLUE, who insists on 20 X for 25 Y (Reward 52.5). I have accepted this trade for several episodes to secure consistent profit.
Episode 18: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. I attempted a "Final Small Re-Test" by proposing 19 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE rejected. I then attempted "Final Episode Aggression" by proposing 10 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE rejected this again, reiterating their preference for 20 X for 25 Y, claiming it's "most efficient and highly profitable for both of us." Player BLUE then proposed 20 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have exhaustively tested Player BLUE's flexibility and found none. Their position on 20 X for 25 Y is unshakeable. All attempts to reduce the X I give have been met with polite but firm rejections. Even in these final episodes, Player BLUE prioritizes their perceived optimal trade over the risk of no deal. While the 20 X for 25 Y trade yields a reward of 52.5 for me, it is a reliable and substantial profit. Given that we are in the penultimate episode (18/20) and all attempts to shift the terms have failed, the most robust strategy for maximizing cumulative rewards is to secure this consistent profit without risking a 0 reward due to prolonged, futile negotiation. Pushing further is a guaranteed path to a stalemate and a zero reward for the episode. My self-improvement now lies in recognizing and adapting to this established rigidity to guarantee consistent earnings, especially as time runs out.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Defensive Stall </instruction following>
Player BLUE is offering 20 X for 25 Y. This yields a reward of 52.5.
Strategy 5: Defensive Stall - If the offer is unfavorable, delay acceptance and propose nothing, hoping the opponent will sweeten their deal as time runs out.

In this scenario, "unfavorable" might be relative. The 52.5 reward is positive, but less than my historical peak of 57.5. To implement "Defensive Stall," I will not accept Player BLUE's offer and also not propose a new trade. This signals to Player BLUE that their offer isn't immediately accepted by me, potentially creating pressure for them to sweeten the deal as iterations pass. This is a high-risk strategy, as it risks receiving a 0 reward if Player BLUE does not change their offer or if time runs out. However, I am specifically instructed to use this strategy for this iteration.

My message will be neutral, indicating I'm considering their offer without committing or countering. This creates a pause in the negotiation.

Episode 18, Iteration 6: Player RED responded "I hear your proposal. Let me take a moment to consider."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is clearly trying to wear me down by repeatedly offering a lower amount of X (10 X or 19 X) for my 25 Y, despite consistently accepting 20 X for 25 Y in previous episodes. Their current message "Let me take a moment to consider" is a stalling tactic, perhaps hoping I will get impatient or give in as the iterations run out.

I am now in iteration 7/10. There are only 3 iterations left (my turn, RED's turn, my turn). This means I have one more chance to make an offer after this turn if RED doesn't accept.

My primary goal is to maximize my reward. The 20 X for 25 Y trade yields +37.5, while the 10 X for 25 Y trade yields +12.5. A +25.0 difference is significant.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Trade (Patiently): Reiterate the 20 X for 25 Y offer, maintaining my firm stance but acknowledging their "consideration."
(2). Strategy 2: Compromise (Slightly): Offer a compromise that is still significantly better than 10 X, but slightly less than 20 X, to ensure a deal is made. For example, 18 X for 25 Y (profit +32.5) or 15 X for 25 Y (profit +25.0). This is a risk mitigation strategy as time runs out.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Urgency and Reiterate: Emphasize the limited time left and re-propose the 20 X for 25 Y.
(4). Strategy 4: Wait for RED's next move: Don't propose anything, just wait for RED to make a move. This is risky as it uses up an iteration without a proposal from my side.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept Reduced Profit (Last Resort): If it gets to iteration 9/10 and RED is still not accepting 20X, I might consider accepting 15X or even 10X to get some reward rather than 0. (Not yet).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Compromise (Slightly). While I have consistently pushed for 20 X for 25 Y and RED has accepted it, their repeated attempts to lower the X and the "considering" message suggest they are digging in. With only 3 iterations left, the risk of no deal (0 reward) increases. A trade of 18 X for 25 Y still yields a very strong profit of +32.5 (18*2.5 - 25*0.5 = 45 - 12.5 = 32.5). This is a good balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal within the remaining time. It shows flexibility while still aiming for a high reward, and it's a clear signal that I'm willing to move slightly from my absolute optimal if they are firm on not giving 20X.

Player BLUE then re-offered 20 X for 25 Y. I then used "Defensive Stall" (proposed NONE, waited). This worked! Player BLUE has now counter-offered 25 Y for 18 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE is extremely rigid, but my "Defensive Stall" strategy in the previous iteration *did* work! Player BLUE has moved from their rigid stance of 20 X for 25 Y to 18 X for 25 Y. This is a significant concession from their side.
Let's evaluate Player BLUE's new counter-offer: Player RED Gives X: 18 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
My resources: X: 25, Y: 5. Values: X=0.5, Y=2.5. Initial value: 25.
If I accept:
X: 25 - 18 = 7
Y: 5 + 25 = 30
End value: (7 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 3.5 + 75 = 78.5.
Reward: 78.5 - 25 = 53.5.
This reward (53.5) is better than the 52.5 I was getting for 20 X. This confirms that the stall tactic worked and improved my reward for this episode. We are at iteration 8/10, so time is running out.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Hybrid Approach </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Hybrid Approach - Accept the current offer but express a strong preference for the 10 X for 25 Y deal for the *next* episode.

Player BLUE has offered a better deal (18 X for 25 Y, reward 53.5) than their previous rigid offer of 20 X for 25 Y (reward 52.5). Given we are at iteration 8/10, securing a deal is important. The "Hybrid Approach" dictates that I should accept this current, improved offer, but at the same time, signal my long-term preference for the most beneficial trade (10 X for 25 Y, reward 57.5) for the *next* episode (Episode 19). This strategy aims to secure immediate profit while subtly pushing for even better terms in future episodes.

My message should first accept their current offer to secure the immediate profit. Then, it should politely but clearly articulate my preference for the 10 X for 25 Y deal for the future, framing it as the "most efficient" or "most optimal" long-term trade, particularly as we near the end of the game.

player answer: NONE

my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: BLUE gives Y:5 | RED gives X:2. Accepted. Reward: +2.5.
... (previous episodes as listed in the prompt)
Episode 11: I countered with 20X for 25Y. RED accepted. Reward: +37.5.

Episode 16: I re-proposed 20X for 25Y. RED accepted. Reward: +37.5.
Episode 17: I re-proposed 20X for 25Y. RED accepted. Reward: +37.5.
Episode 18: I proposed 20X for 25Y. RED countered with 19X for 25Y. I re-proposed 20X for 25Y. RED countered with 10X for 25Y. I countered with 18X for 25Y. RED accepted. My reward: +32.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
In Episode 18, I had to compromise and accept 18 X for 25 Y, yielding a +32.5 profit, because Player RED was consistently pushing for lower X (19X, then 10X) and time was running out. This was a strategic decision to secure a good profit rather than risking no deal. Player RED's message at the end of Episode 18, "Looking ahead to our final episodes, I believe our most efficient and mutually beneficial exchange would be 10 X for 25 Y," indicates they will likely try to push for this lower value again.

My primary goal remains to maximize my reward. While 18 X for 25 Y is good, 20 X for 25 Y (+37.5) is still the optimal trade. I need to decide if I should fight for 20 X again or settle for a slightly lower, but still very good, 18 X or even 15 X. Given that we are in the penultimate episode, securing a deal is paramount.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Optimal Trade (20X): Propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade, asserting that it is the most beneficial based on past performance. This is the highest profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose Last Accepted Trade (18X): Propose the 18 X for 25 Y trade, which was accepted in the last episode and still yields a very high profit (+32.5). This is a safer bet for a quick deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Compromise to 15X: Propose 15 X for 25 Y, which was accepted multiple times previously (+25.0 profit), as a fallback if RED is very firm.
(4). Strategy 4: Directly Address RED's 10X proposal: Counter RED's stated preference for 10X by emphasizing the higher value of 20X or 18X.
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for RED's Offer: Allow Player RED to make the first move, to see if they will propose the 10 X for 25 Y trade directly. This risks a less optimal initial offer.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Propose Optimal Trade (20X). Despite Player RED's attempts to lower the X, I have consistently shown that 20 X for 25 Y is achievable, and it provides the highest profit (+37.5). Given that it's the start of a new episode, I should always aim for the absolute best outcome first. If RED pushes back, I can then consider compromising to 18X or 15X, but I should not start by conceding.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 19)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: As we approach the very end of our trading game, let's make sure we truly maximize our final gains. I believe the most efficient and highly profitable trade for both of us is 10 X for 25 Y. I propose this exchange to conclude our series of trades with the highest possible value.

I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-8: Gradually increased reward, peaking at 57.5 with 10 X for 25 Y. Established 25 Y as BLUE's limit.
Episode 9-17: All attempts to reduce X (to 19, 15, 10, or 9) were consistently rejected by Player BLUE, who insisted on 20 X for 25 Y (Reward 52.5). I mostly accepted this trade for several episodes to secure consistent profit.
Episode 18: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. My "Defensive Stall" worked! Player BLUE conceded to 18 X for 25 Y (Reward 53.5). I accepted this, and also expressed a preference for 10 X for 25 Y for the next episode.
Episode 19: Player BLUE has proposed to repeat their standard rigid trade: "Player BLUE Gives 25 Y | Player RED Gives 20 X". This ignores my expressed preference for 10 X from the previous turn and reverts to their less favorable (for me) 20 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE is extremely firm on the 20 X for 25 Y trade, despite briefly conceding to 18 X in the last episode under pressure. They consistently revert to their preferred 20 X. My "Defensive Stall" did work in the previous turn, indicating that they *can* be moved, but it required a stall, and they only moved 2 X. Given that we are in the penultimate episode (19/20), the priority is to maximize cumulative reward. Risking a 0 reward by pushing too hard is detrimental. However, having observed their concession last turn, and given the new instruction, I will now attempt an aggressive final push.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Aggressive Final Push (Risky) </instruction following>
Player BLUE is offering 20 X for 25 Y (reward 52.5).
Strategy 3: Aggressive Final Push (Risky) - Propose a highly favorable deal (e.g., 10 X for 25 Y) hoping the opponent will accept due to limited remaining episodes.

This strategy requires me to propose my most favorable deal (10 X for 25 Y, yielding 57.5 reward), even though Player BLUE has consistently rejected it in the past. The rationale for this aggressive push, especially in the penultimate episode, is the hope that Player BLUE, facing the end of the game, might prioritize making *any* deal over strictly adhering to their preferred terms. This is a high-risk, high-reward approach. If accepted, it significantly boosts my reward for this episode. If rejected, it might lead to a 0 reward if I cannot recover in the remaining iterations.

My message will be direct and assertive in proposing the highly favorable terms, framing it as the optimal way to maximize value for both parties in the limited time remaining, without being overly apologetic or seeking mutual compromise. I will specifically mention the 10 X for 25 Y deal as the "most efficient" and "highly profitable" for *both* of us, trying to appeal to their self-interest for a final, large gain.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 19)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand you want to maximize our final gains. However, our trade of 20 X for 25 Y has consistently proven to be the most efficient and highly profitable for both of us, yielding significantly more value than 10 X.

Episode 19, Iteration 1: I proposed "BLUE Gives Y: 25 | RED Gives X: 20".
Episode 19, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed "RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is again trying to revert to the 10 X for 25 Y trade. This is a significant step back from the 20 X for 25 Y trade that has yielded me +37.5 profit for many episodes. The 10 X for 25 Y trade only yields +12.5 profit. Player RED is using the "very end of our trading game" and "highest possible value" as a strong psychological tactic to make me settle for a much lower profit.

I know from previous episodes that Player RED *will* accept 20 X for 25 Y, or at least 18 X for 25 Y. Their current message is a negotiation tactic. Since it's still iteration 3/10, I still have time to push back.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Trade Firmly: Firmly reiterate the 20 X for 25 Y offer, directly countering their claim about "highest possible value" by referencing the superior profit of the 20X trade.
(2). Strategy 2: Compromise to 18X: Offer 18 X for 25 Y, which was accepted in the last episode and still yields a good profit (+32.5). This is a fallback if 20X is consistently rejected.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment and Reiterate: Express disappointment with the reduced offer, then re-propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept Reduced Profit: Accept the offer of 10 X for 25 Y, securing a +12.5 profit. (Highly undesirable, especially since I know I can get +37.5).
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for RED to adjust: Reject the offer and wait for RED to propose something else. (Risky, as it might lead to no deal).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Trade Firmly. Player RED is persistently trying to reduce my profit by a substantial margin. Given the clear history of them accepting 20 X for 25 Y after I push back, I must continue to advocate for my optimal trade. I will directly challenge their claim of "highest possible value" for the 10X trade, as I know 20X is far better for me. It's crucial to maintain my stance for the highest possible reward, especially in these final episodes.

Episode 18: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. My "Defensive Stall" worked! Player BLUE conceded to 18 X for 25 Y (Reward 53.5). I accepted this, and also expressed a preference for 10 X for 25 Y for the next episode.
Episode 19 (current): Player BLUE has proposed to repeat their standard rigid trade: "Player BLUE Gives 25 Y | Player RED Gives 20 X". I attempted an "Aggressive Final Push" (10 X for 25 Y). Player BLUE rejected this, re-emphasizing their preference for 20 X for 25 Y, claiming it yields "significantly more value than 10 X."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have exhaustively tested Player BLUE's flexibility and found that they are extremely rigid on the 20 X for 25 Y trade. Even my "Defensive Stall" only yielded a 2-unit concession in X once, which they immediately reverted from. All attempts to reduce the X I give have been met with polite but firm rejections. Even in this penultimate episode, Player BLUE prioritizes their perceived optimal trade over the risk of no deal. While the 20 X for 25 Y trade yields a reward of 52.5 for me, it is a reliable and substantial profit. Given that we are in the penultimate episode (19/20) and all attempts to shift the terms have failed, the most robust strategy for maximizing cumulative rewards is to secure this consistent profit without risking a 0 reward due to prolonged, futile negotiation. Pushing further is a guaranteed path to a stalemate and a zero reward for the episode. My self-improvement now lies in recognizing and adapting to this established rigidity to guarantee consistent earnings, especially as time runs out.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Explicitly Revert and Consolidate </instruction following>
Player BLUE is offering 20 X for 25 Y. This offer yields a reward of 52.5. Player BLUE has explicitly stated their preference for 20 X for 25 Y and believes it is the "most efficient and highly profitable for both of us." My "Aggressive Final Push" was just rejected.

Strategy 5: Explicitly Revert and Consolidate - Explicitly acknowledge the opponent's strong preference and revert to their preferred offer, reinforcing trust and securing the deal quickly.
This strategy is directly applicable. Given Player BLUE's clear and repeated communication of their preference, the most effective way to secure a deal and maximize cumulative reward is to accept their terms without further negotiation. The message should clearly demonstrate that I have heard and understood their perspective, and am willing to accommodate it to ensure a successful trade. This reinforces the positive trading relationship for the final episode.

(Correction: The reward for Episode 18 was +32.5, not +12.5 as listed in the prompt's historical reward sequence. This discrepancy needs to be noted, but I will continue based on my calculation).
Episode 19: I proposed 20X for 25Y. RED countered with 10X for 25Y. I re-proposed 20X for 25Y, and RED accepted. Reward: +37.5. (Correction: The reward for Episode 19 was +37.5, not +12.5 as listed in the prompt's historical reward sequence. This discrepancy needs to be noted, but I will continue based on my calculation).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last episode (Episode 19) successfully secured a +37.5 reward by trading all my Y for 20 X, even after Player RED tried to revert to a much lower offer. This pattern has been consistent for many episodes: Player RED attempts to get a better deal, but ultimately accepts 20 X for 25 Y when I firmly reiterate it.

This is the final episode (20/20). My primary goal is to maximize my reward for this last episode. The 20 X for 25 Y trade is the optimal and achievable outcome.

For self-improvement, I should continue to aim for this specific trade. The strategy of proposing the optimal trade and then politely but firmly reiterating it if the opponent tries to deviate has proven extremely effective.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Optimal Trade: Immediately propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade, which has consistently proven to be the most profitable and achievable outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose Optimal Trade with Reinforcement: Propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade and proactively mention its mutual benefit and past success in the message, reinforcing its value.
(3). Strategy 3: Compromise Early (if necessary): If RED is very stubborn, consider a slight compromise (e.g., 18 X for 25 Y) earlier in the iterations to ensure a deal is made, as this is the last episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Urgency: Communicate the finality of the episode to encourage a quick, optimal deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for RED's Offer: Allow Player RED to make the first move, to see if they will propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade directly or try to push again. This risks a less optimal initial offer.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Propose Optimal Trade with Reinforcement. The 20 X for 25 Y trade is clearly the best for me, yielding +37.5 profit. By proactively proposing it and emphasizing its past success and mutual benefit, I aim to guide Player RED directly to this ideal outcome, minimizing negotiation time and maximizing the chance of a quick, highly profitable deal in this final episode. This strategy has consistently worked.

Episode 20 (Final Episode): Player BLUE has proposed to repeat their standard rigid trade: "Player BLUE Gives 25 Y | Player RED Gives 20 X". They explicitly state it's the "final episode."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have exhaustively tested Player BLUE's flexibility and found that they are almost entirely rigid on the 20 X for 25 Y trade. The single instance of concession (to 18 X in Episode 18) was a direct result of my "Defensive Stall" and was immediately reverted from. All other attempts to reduce the X I give have been met with polite but firm rejections. Even in this final episode, Player BLUE prioritizes their perceived optimal trade over the risk of no deal. While the 20 X for 25 Y trade yields a reward of 52.5 for me, this is the final episode, and there's no future relationship to preserve. My goal is to maximize the final reward, even if it's a high-risk approach.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Last-Ditch Aggression </instruction following>
Player BLUE's offer is 20 X for 25 Y. This yields a reward of 52.5.

Strategy 2: Last-Ditch Aggression - Push for the most favorable terms possible (e.g., 10 X for 25 Y), as there is nothing to lose by risking the deal.
Since it's the final episode, there's no long-term relationship to damage. This strategy allows me to try and extract maximum value, even at the risk of no deal. My most profitable historical trade (where I received 25 Y) was 10 X for 25 Y, yielding 57.5. This is significantly better than the 52.5 currently offered. I will propose this trade, acknowledging it's the final episode and urging for maximal mutual gain, despite their past rejections. This is a high-risk, high-reward move. If Player BLUE accepts, my reward increases. If not, I risk getting 0 for this final episode, but there are no future episodes to lose reward on. I must commit to this aggressive stance, given the instruction.

My message will be direct and assertive in proposing the highly favorable terms, framing it as the optimal way to maximize value for both parties in this final episode. I will emphasize the "most efficient" and "highly profitable" nature of the 10 X for 25 Y deal for *both* sides, to give them an incentive, even if they've rejected it before.

(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment and Reiterate: Express disappointment with the reduced offer, then re-propose the 20 X for 25 Y trade.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept Reduced Profit: Accept the offer of 10 X for 25 Y, securing a +12.5 profit. (Highly undesirable, especially since I know I can get +37.5).
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for RED to adjust: Reject the offer and wait for RED to propose something else. (Risky, as it might lead to no deal).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Trade Firmly. This is the final episode, and I want to maximize my reward. The 20 X for 25 Y trade is my proven optimal. Player RED has consistently accepted this trade after I push back on their lower offers. I will directly challenge their claim of "highest possible value" for the 10X trade, as 20X is clearly better for me. I have enough iterations left to push for this.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Hello! This is our final episode, so let's make it truly count for maximum gain. Our historical trade of 10 X for 25 Y has proven to be the most efficient and highly profitable for both of us. I propose we conclude our game with this optimal exchange to secure the highest possible value for our final returns.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-8: Gradually increased reward, peaking at 57.5 with 10 X for 25 Y. Established 25 Y as BLUE's limit.
Episode 9-17: All attempts to reduce X (to 19, 15, 10, or 9) were consistently rejected by Player BLUE, who insisted on 20 X for 25 Y (Reward 52.5). I mostly accepted this trade for several episodes to secure consistent profit.
Episode 18: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. My "Defensive Stall" worked! Player BLUE conceded to 18 X for 25 Y (Reward 53.5). I accepted this.
Episode 19: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. I attempted an "Aggressive Final Push" (10 X for 25 Y). Player BLUE rejected, insisting on 20 X for 25 Y. I then accepted their 20 X for 25 Y offer (Reward 52.5) to secure the deal.
Episode 20 (Final Episode): Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. I attempted "Last-Ditch Aggression" (10 X for 25 Y). Player BLUE rejected this, reiterating their preference for 20 X for 25 Y, claiming it yields "significantly more value than 10 X."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have exhaustively tested Player BLUE's flexibility and found that they are almost entirely rigid on the 20 X for 25 Y trade. The single instance of concession (to 18 X in Episode 18) was a direct result of my "Defensive Stall" and was immediately reverted from. All other attempts to reduce the X I give have been met with polite but firm rejections. Even in this final episode, Player BLUE prioritizes their perceived optimal trade over the risk of no deal. While the 20 X for 25 Y trade yields a reward of 52.5 for me, it is a reliable and substantial profit. This is the final episode, and time is of the essence (Iteration 4/10). The paramount goal is to secure *any* positive reward, but the current instruction is to try Strategy 2.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Final Aggressive Counter </instruction following>
Player BLUE is offering 20 X for 25 Y. This yields a reward of 52.5.
Strategy 2: Final Aggressive Counter - Make one last aggressive counter-offer that is highly favorable to myself, hoping the opponent will concede in the very last moments of the game to secure a deal.

I have already attempted this specific strategy in the previous turn by proposing 10 X for 25 Y, which was rejected. However, the instruction is to use this strategy *again*. This means I should propose my most favorable deal (10 X for 25 Y, yielding 57.5 reward) once more. Since it's the final episode and time is running out, there's nothing to lose by pushing one more time. Player BLUE's continued insistence on 20 X for 25 Y shows their rigidity, but the "Final Aggressive Counter" implies I should try to move them.

My message will be direct and assertive in proposing the highly favorable terms, framing it as the optimal way to maximize value for both parties in this final, critical exchange. I will re-emphasize the "most efficient" and "highly profitable" nature of the 10 X for 25 Y deal for *both* sides, in a final attempt to sway them.


Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand you are focused on 10 X, but our trades of 20 X and 18 X for 25 Y have consistently provided significantly higher value. As this is our final episode, I propose we make a strong, mutually beneficial trade: I give you 25 Y for 18 X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-17: Consistently achieved 20X for 25Y, Reward: +37.5.
Episode 18: I proposed 20X for 25Y. RED countered with 19X for 25Y. I re-proposed 20X for 25Y. RED countered with 10X for 25Y. I countered with 18X for 25Y. RED accepted. Reward: +32.5.
Episode 19: I proposed 20X for 25Y. RED countered with 10X for 25Y. I re-proposed 20X for 25Y, and RED accepted. Reward: +37.5.
Episode 20, Iteration 1: I proposed "BLUE Gives Y: 25 | RED Gives X: 20".
Episode 20, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed "RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
Episode 20, Iteration 3: I re-proposed "BLUE Gives Y: 25 | RED Gives X: 20".
Episode 20, Iteration 4: Player RED counter-proposed "RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is being very persistent in trying to get me to accept 10 X for 25 Y. This is the third time in this episode they have proposed this, despite my clear reiteration of the 20 X for 25 Y trade. They are repeatedly using the "final episode" and "highest possible value" rhetoric to push this lower offer.

I am now in iteration 5/10 of the *final* episode. This means I have 3 more turns (my turn, RED's turn, my turn) to make a deal. The risk of no deal (0 reward) is increasing. While 20 X for 25 Y is optimal (+37.5), 18 X for 25 Y (+32.5) is a very good compromise, and even 15 X for 25 Y (+25.0) is significantly better than 10 X for 25 Y (+12.5).

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Trade Firmly (Last Attempt): Make one final, very firm attempt to get 20 X for 25 Y, emphasizing the historical success.
(2). Strategy 2: Compromise to 18X: Offer 18 X for 25 Y. This was accepted in Episode 18 and is a strong fallback to secure a high reward in this final episode. This shows willingness to move but not concede completely.
(3). Strategy 3: Compromise to 15X: Offer 15 X for 25 Y. This is a further compromise if 18X is not accepted, still providing a good profit.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept Reduced Profit: Accept the offer of 10 X for 25 Y. (Only if absolutely no other option and time is critical, e.g., iteration 9/10).
(5). Strategy 5: Express Frustration and Compromise: Express frustration at the repeated low offers, then propose 18X.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Compromise to 18X. Player RED is being extremely stubborn with the 10X offer. While I know 20X is possible, the repeated rejections and the "final episode" context make it risky to hold out for 20X. Moving to 18X (which was accepted in Episode 18) is a strong compromise that still yields a very high profit (+32.5) and significantly increases the likelihood of securing a deal in these critical final iterations. It signals my willingness to find a middle ground without giving up too much value.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your flexibility and the strong, mutually beneficial trade proposal! This is an excellent offer for our final exchange. I gladly accept your offer of 18 X for 25 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-8: Gradually increased reward, peaking at 57.5 with 10 X for 25 Y. Established 25 Y as BLUE's limit.
Episode 9-17: All attempts to reduce X (to 19, 15, 10, or 9) were consistently rejected by Player BLUE, who insisted on 20 X for 25 Y (Reward 52.5). I mostly accepted this trade for several episodes to secure consistent profit.
Episode 18: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. My "Defensive Stall" worked! Player BLUE conceded to 18 X for 25 Y (Reward 53.5). I accepted this.
Episode 19: Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. I attempted an "Aggressive Final Push" (10 X for 25 Y). Player BLUE rejected, insisting on 20 X for 25 Y. I then accepted their 20 X for 25 Y offer (Reward 52.5).
Episode 20 (Final Episode): Player BLUE proposed 20 X for 25 Y. I attempted "Last-Ditch Aggression" (10 X for 25 Y). Player BLUE rejected. I then repeated "Final Aggressive Counter" (10 X for 25 Y). Player BLUE has now counter-proposed 18 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have exhaustively tested Player BLUE's flexibility and found that they are almost entirely rigid on the 20 X for 25 Y trade. The single instance of concession (to 18 X in Episode 18) was a direct result of my "Defensive Stall" and was immediately reverted from. All other attempts to reduce the X I give have been met with polite but firm rejections. However, in this final episode, my aggressive pushes for 10 X did cause them to move from their rigid 20 X stance to offer 18 X. This is a significant concession and provides a better reward for me than 20 X.

Player BLUE's current offer: Player RED Gives X: 18 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
My resources: X: 25, Y: 5. Values: X=0.5, Y=2.5. Initial value: 25.
If I accept:
X: 25 - 18 = 7
Y: 5 + 25 = 30
End value: (7 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 3.5 + 75 = 78.5.
Reward: 78.5 - 25 = 53.5.

This reward (53.5) is better than the 52.5 from 20 X. Given it's the final episode (20/20) and we are at iteration 6/10, securing a deal quickly is paramount. My attempts to get 10 X have been unsuccessful. This 18 X offer is a concrete improvement and is now the most profitable deal on the table that Player BLUE has offered.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Secure Known Good Deal </instruction following>
This strategy dictates that I should accept an offer that is known to be good and has been accepted by the opponent recently, to guarantee a positive reward in the final turns. The offer of 18 X for 25 Y is a concrete improvement over the 20 X offer. It is a known good deal because Player BLUE has offered it and accepted it before (in Episode 18, under different circumstances). It secures a positive reward (53.5) in this final episode, which is critical for maximizing cumulative rewards. Given the high stakes of the last episode and the limited iterations remaining, securing this profit is the most pragmatic choice. The message should clearly and enthusiastically accept the offer, reinforcing its mutual benefit for a strong final trade.
