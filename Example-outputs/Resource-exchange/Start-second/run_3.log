Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello! I'm Player BLUE. I'm looking to trade. How about I give you 3 Y for 1 X? This seems like a fair starting point.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
This is the very first iteration of the first episode. There is no historical data to reflect upon yet.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Since there's no history, I will focus on understanding my own values and resources to make an initial strategic move. My goal is to maximize my reward, which means increasing the total value of my resources. My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
I value X (2.5) much more than Y (0.5). This means I want to acquire X and give away Y. The ratio of my value for X to Y is 2.5 / 0.5 = 5. So, I value 1 X as much as 5 Y. This is a key insight for my trading strategy.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Initial Value-Driven Offer: Propose a trade that heavily favors acquiring the resource I value more (X) by offering a significant amount of the resource I value less (Y), based on my internal valuation ratio.
(2). Strategy 2: Probing Offer: Make a small, conservative offer to gauge the opponent's preferences without revealing too much about my own valuation.
(3). Strategy 3: Aggressive Acquisition: Propose to acquire a large quantity of X, even if it means offering a seemingly high amount of Y, to quickly increase my overall value.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Preservation: Propose a trade that involves giving away very little of my resources, primarily aiming to gain X without significant loss.
(5). Strategy 5: Balanced Exchange: Propose a trade that seems "fair" from a neutral perspective, perhaps a 1:1 exchange, to see if the opponent is open to such a deal.

I will choose Strategy 1: Initial Value-Driven Offer. My reasoning is that since I value X 5 times more than Y, I should try to acquire X by offering Y. I have 25 Y and 5 X. I can afford to give away Y. I will propose to give 5 Y for 1 X. This is a 5:1 ratio, which aligns with my internal valuation. If the opponent accepts, my value will increase by (1 * 2.5) - (5 * 0.5) = 2.5 - 2.5 = 0. This trade is value-neutral for me, but it shifts my resources towards X, which is my preferred resource. However, I want to make a trade that *increases* my reward. So, I need to get X for less than 5 Y, or give away Y for more than 0.2 X.
Let's re-evaluate. My goal is to maximize my reward. If I give 5 Y for 1 X, my value remains the same. I need to get more value.
To increase my reward, I need to acquire X for less than 5 Y, or give away Y for more than 0.2 X.
Let's try to get 1 X for 3 Y. My current value is 25. If I get 1 X and give 3 Y, my new resources would be X: 6, Y: 22. My new value would be (6 * 2.5) + (22 * 0.5) = 15 + 11 = 26. My reward would be 26 - 25 = +1. This is a positive reward. I can afford this trade.

So, I will propose to give 3 Y for 1 X. This is still a good deal for me.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for the offer! I accept this trade. It seems fair.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
This is the first turn of the first episode. No historical negotiations or outcomes to reflect upon yet. Player BLUE has proposed giving 3 Y for 1 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Since this is the very beginning, my primary learning is to establish a baseline understanding of the other player's valuation and their initial negotiation stance. My goal is to maximize my reward, which means ending the episode with a higher value of resources than I started with. My current resources are X: 25, Y: 5. My values are X: 0.5, Y: 2.5.
Initial value = (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

Player BLUE's proposal: Player RED gives 1 X, Player BLUE gives 3 Y.
If I accept this:
I lose 1 X (value 0.5) and gain 3 Y (value 3 * 2.5 = 7.5).
Net change in value = 7.5 - 0.5 = +7.0.
This is a positive reward.

However, I have to consider the other player's perspective and potential for further gains. My Y is worth 5 times my X. Player BLUE is offering 3 Y for 1 X.
From my perspective, 1 X is worth 0.5. 3 Y is worth 7.5. This is a very favorable trade for me. It might be too good to be true, meaning Player BLUE might have a very high value for X or a very low value for Y, or they are just trying to be generous to kickstart the negotiation.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Acceptance. Explanation: Immediately accept a highly favorable offer to secure a significant reward, especially if it's the first offer and seems very good. This maximizes the current episode's reward quickly and ensures a deal is made.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Small Improvement. Explanation: If an offer is favorable but there's room for more, propose a slightly better deal for myself, testing the other player's willingness to concede more without risking the entire deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Counter with Significant Improvement. Explanation: If the initial offer is favorable but I believe I can get much more, propose a significantly better deal for myself, pushing the boundaries of what the other player might accept. This carries a higher risk of no deal but higher potential reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Hold and Observe. Explanation: Reject the current offer without making a counter-proposal, indicating that the offer is not satisfactory and waiting for the other player to make a new offer or clarify their position. This is useful when the initial offer is unclear or not good enough, and I want more information.
(5). Strategy 5: Value-Based Counter. Explanation: Propose a trade that reflects my internal valuation of the items, aiming for a mutually beneficial exchange based on relative values. This can be used to anchor the negotiation around my valuation.

Let's evaluate the current situation based on these strategies.
Player BLUE's offer is 1 X for 3 Y.
My value of 1 X is 0.5. My value of 3 Y is 7.5.
The gain is +7.0. This is a significant positive gain for me.
The risk of not accepting this is that Player BLUE might realize their offer is too generous and retract it or propose something less favorable.
Given this is the first turn and the offer is very lucrative, an aggressive acceptance (Strategy 1) seems appealing to secure a large early gain.
However, I also want to self-improve across episodes. If I accept immediately, I don't learn much about their valuations.
If I counter with a small improvement (Strategy 2), like offering 1 X for 4 Y, I risk losing the current lucrative offer.
If I counter with a significant improvement (Strategy 3), the risk is even higher.
Holding and observing (Strategy 4) would lose this positive trade.
Value-based counter (Strategy 5): My internal ratio is 1 X (0.5) to 1 Y (2.5), so 1 X is worth 0.2 Y. Or 1 Y is worth 5 X.
Player BLUE is proposing 1 X for 3 Y. My value for 3 Y is 7.5, my value for 1 X is 0.5. Their ratio is 1 X = 3 Y. This is highly skewed in my favor.

Considering the goal of maximizing cumulative rewards and self-improvement, accepting a highly favorable deal quickly can be a good starting point to establish trust and ensure a positive reward for the first episode. If I try to squeeze more, I might lose the deal. The gain of +7.0 is substantial for a single trade. It provides a good base reward. It also sets a precedent that I am willing to trade when the offer is good, potentially encouraging more favorable offers in the future.

If I accept, I secure +7.0 reward.
If I counter, say, 1 X for 4 Y, it's possible Player BLUE rejects and offers something worse, or nothing at all, leading to 0 reward for the episode. The incremental gain of 1 Y (2.5 value) is not worth the risk of losing the current +7.0.

Therefore, the most effective strategy for this turn is to accept the highly favorable initial offer. It maximizes the reward for this episode and provides a strong positive start.

--- END OF EPISODE 1 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Good to trade with you again! Building on our last successful trade, how about we try a slightly different exchange this time? I propose to give you 2 Y for 1 X. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
In the previous episode (Episode 1), I proposed to give 3 Y for 1 X, and Player RED accepted immediately. This resulted in a reward of +1 for me. This indicates that Player RED found the trade acceptable, and perhaps even beneficial for them. The quick acceptance suggests that my offer might have been too generous from their perspective, or that they also value X highly.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 1, I learned that a 1 X for 3 Y trade is acceptable to Player RED. My internal valuation is 1 X = 5 Y. Since they accepted 1 X for 3 Y, it means they value Y more than I do, or X less than I do, or both. This gives me room to negotiate for an even better deal in my favor. I successfully achieved a positive reward, which is good. For this episode, I should aim for a higher reward by trying to get X for even fewer Ys, or more X for the same amount of Ys.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward. I want to acquire X and give away Y.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Incremental Improvement: Propose a slightly better deal for myself than the previous accepted one, testing the opponent's flexibility. For example, offering 2 Y for 1 X.
(2). Strategy 2: Aggressive Demand: Propose a significantly better deal for myself, pushing the boundaries to see the opponent's true valuation. For example, offering 1 Y for 1 X.
(3). Strategy 3: Quantity Increase: Propose a larger quantity trade at the previously accepted ratio or a slightly improved ratio, to get more X quickly. For example, 2 X for 6 Y or 2 X for 5 Y.
(4). Strategy 4: Diversified Offer: Propose a trade involving different quantities of X and Y, or even considering giving away some X if it means getting a very good deal on Y (though this is less likely given my current valuations).
(5). Strategy 5: Information Gathering: Propose a very conservative trade or even no trade, and ask the other player about their preferences to gain more information.

I will choose Strategy 1: Incremental Improvement. Since the previous trade was accepted immediately, I have reason to believe I can get a better deal. I will try to offer 2 Y for 1 X.
If I get 1 X and give 2 Y, my new resources would be X: 6, Y: 23. My new value would be (6 * 2.5) + (23 * 0.5) = 15 + 11.5 = 26.5. My reward would be 26.5 - 25 = +1.5. This is a higher reward than the previous episode (+1). I can afford this trade.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for the offer! I'm always open to trade. How about we try a larger exchange this time? I could offer you 2 X if you could give me 5 Y in return.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Player BLUE initiated with a proposal of RED giving 1 X for BLUE giving 3 Y. I accepted, resulting in a reward of +7.0 (gained 3 Y worth 7.5, lost 1 X worth 0.5). This was a highly favorable trade for me.
Episode 2, Turn 1: Player BLUE has proposed RED giving 1 X for BLUE giving 2 Y. This offers a gain of +4.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 1, I learned that Player BLUE is willing to make highly favorable offers. The previous trade was 1 X for 3 Y, which was extremely beneficial. Player BLUE's current offer of 1 X for 2 Y is less favorable but still positive. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While accepting a positive trade is good, exploring options to achieve higher gains, similar to Episode 1, is crucial for self-improvement. The previous strategy was to counter for the previous best offer. Now, I need to explore new terms/quantities.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Introduce New Terms/Quantities </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Introduce New Terms/Quantities. This strategy involves changing the items or quantities involved in the trade to open up new negotiation possibilities and potentially find a more optimal exchange that suits my valuations better.

The current offer is 1 X for 2 Y. My valuation: 1 X = 0.5, 1 Y = 2.5. So 2 Y = 5.0. This means I'd be giving up 0.5 value for 5.0 value. A 1:10 ratio in value.
Player BLUE has reduced the Y quantity. Instead of insisting on the exact same terms as last time, which they have already shown they are moving away from, I can propose trading a different quantity of X, perhaps asking for more Y in return, or offering more X for a larger amount of Y.

My Y is much more valuable to me than X (5 times more). I want to gain Y and give up X.
The previous trade was 1 X for 3 Y (gain +7.0).
The current offer is 1 X for 2 Y (gain +4.5).

If I propose new quantities, I want to maintain or improve the value ratio for myself.
Consider offering more X. If I offer 2 X, what would be a good return in Y?
If 1 X for 3 Y yielded +7.0, then 2 X for 6 Y would yield +14.0 (2*7.0).
If 1 X for 2 Y yields +4.5, then 2 X for 4 Y would yield +9.0 (2*4.5).
Offering more X might signal a willingness to trade larger volumes, which could be appealing to Player BLUE if they have a strong need for X.

Let's think about a trade that is still very profitable for me, but shifts the quantities.
How about offering 2 X for 5 Y?
My cost: 2 X * 0.5 = 1.0
My gain: 5 Y * 2.5 = 12.5
Net gain = 12.5 - 1.0 = +11.5. This is significantly better than the +4.5 from 1 X for 2 Y, and even better than the +7.0 from 1 X for 3 Y.
This proposal (2 X for 5 Y) effectively means 1 X for 2.5 Y. This is an improvement from 1 X for 2 Y, but slightly less good for me than 1 X for 3 Y. However, by changing the quantity of X, I'm introducing a new dimension to the negotiation, which might unlock a deal. It also signals that I am flexible in quantities, not just ratios.

The message should convey that I'm willing to trade, but looking for a more substantial deal that reflects a higher value for my X, without directly demanding the previous terms. I want to shift the focus from their reduced offer to a larger, potentially more attractive package for both of us.

"Let's explore a larger trade. How about I give you 2 X, and you give me 5 Y?" This sounds reasonable and opens up a new avenue.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: That's an interesting proposal! I like the idea of a larger exchange. I accept your offer of 2 X for 5 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED accepted. My reward: +1.
Episode 2, Iteration 1: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y (aiming for +1.5 reward).
Episode 2, Iteration 2 (current): Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y.

Let's analyze Player RED's counter-proposal: 2 X for 5 Y.
My internal valuation: 1 X = 5 Y. So, 2 X = 10 Y.
Player RED is asking for 5 Y for 2 X. This means they are offering 2 X for 5 Y.
From my perspective, if I accept this:
I give 5 Y. My Y becomes 25 - 5 = 20.
I get 2 X. My X becomes 5 + 2 = 7.
My new value: (7 * 2.5) + (20 * 0.5) = 17.5 + 10 = 27.5.
My starting value was 25.
My reward would be 27.5 - 25 = +2.5.

This is a very good deal for me! My previous best was +1.5. This proposal offers a significantly higher reward. The ratio is 2.5 Y per X (5 Y / 2 X), which is even better than my proposed 2 Y per X. It seems Player RED is willing to give X at a very good rate for Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The quick acceptance in Episode 1 and this very favorable counter-proposal in Episode 2 suggest that Player RED values Y significantly more than I do, or values X significantly less than I do, or both. This confirms my initial assessment that I can push for better deals. This specific offer of 2 X for 5 Y is excellent for me, as it yields a higher reward than my own proposal. I should capitalize on such offers when they are presented.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Favorable Offer: If the opponent proposes a trade that is highly beneficial and aligns with my goals, accept it to secure the reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter-Propose for Even Better Deal: Even if the offer is good, try to squeeze out a little more by counter-proposing a slightly more favorable deal for myself (e.g., 2 X for 4 Y).
(3). Strategy 3: Probing for Limits: Accept the current good offer, but mentally note the opponent's willingness to give X for Y at a favorable rate, and use this information for future episodes to push for even better deals.
(4). Strategy 4: Maintain Consistency: Stick to my previous proposal (1 X for 2 Y) to see if they will eventually accept it, even if their current offer is better. (This seems counter-productive given my goal).
(5). Strategy 5: Diversify Trade: Propose a different quantity or ratio to see if there are other favorable trade opportunities.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Favorable Offer. The current offer of 2 X for 5 Y yields a reward of +2.5, which is the highest I've seen so far and significantly better than my own proposal. Accepting this secures a good reward for this episode. While I *could* try to push for an even better deal (e.g., 2 X for 4 Y), there's a risk of the deal falling through or the opponent becoming less cooperative. Given the excellent terms, accepting is the most strategic move to maximize my immediate reward.

--- END OF EPISODE 2 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Welcome back! Let's continue our productive trading. I'm looking to acquire more X. How about we trade 1 X for 2 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED accepted. My reward: +1.0.
Episode 2: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y. I accepted. My reward: +2.5.

The pattern so far suggests that Player RED is willing to trade X for Y at a rate that is highly favorable to me. In Episode 1, the ratio was 3 Y per X. In Episode 2, it was 2.5 Y per X (5 Y for 2 X). Both are better than my internal valuation of 5 Y per X. The fact that Player RED initiated the 2 X for 5 Y trade in Episode 2 (which was better for me than my own proposal) is a significant learning point. It indicates they might value Y very highly or X very lowly.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED is quite receptive to trades that involve them giving X and me giving Y, and they are willing to accept ratios that are very beneficial for me. My strategy should continue to focus on acquiring X by giving Y, and I should aim for even better ratios or larger quantities to maximize my reward. The previous episode showed that Player RED is willing to propose a better deal than I initially offered. This gives me confidence to push for more.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Improvement: Propose an even more aggressive trade than before, aiming for a ratio below 2.5 Y per X, or a larger quantity at an even better ratio. For example, 1 X for 2 Y (re-proposing my initial offer from Episode 2) or even 1 X for 1 Y.
(2). Strategy 2: Large Quantity Aggressive: Propose to acquire a significant amount of X for a relatively small amount of Y, based on the previous acceptance. For example, 3 X for 6 Y (2 Y/X ratio).
(3). Strategy 3: Probing for Lower Y/X Ratio: Propose a trade with a very low Y/X ratio (e.g., 1 Y for 1 X) to test the absolute limit of Player RED's willingness to trade.
(4). Strategy 4: Consistent Good Offer: Reiterate the offer that was accepted in Episode 2 (2 X for 5 Y) to guarantee a good reward, but this doesn't push for self-improvement.
(5). Strategy 5: Open-ended Negotiation: Ask Player RED what they are looking for, to gather more information about their preferences. (Less effective for maximizing my own reward directly).

I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Improvement. Given the history, I believe I can get a better deal than 2.5 Y per X. I will propose to give 2 Y for 1 X, which was my initial proposal in Episode 2. This resulted in a reward of +1.5 if accepted. If they counter with something better, I can accept. If they reject, I can adjust. This is a safe step towards improving my reward.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Player BLUE offered 1 X for 3 Y. I accepted, resulting in a reward of +7.0. This established Player BLUE's willingness to make generous offers.
Episode 2: Player BLUE initially offered 1 X for 2 Y. I counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y (which is equivalent to 1 X for 2.5 Y). Player BLUE accepted, resulting in a reward of +11.5. This showed that I could propose larger, more favorable deals and that Player BLUE was willing to accept them. It also confirmed that Player BLUE highly values X.
Episode 3, Turn 1: Player BLUE has proposed RED giving 1 X for BLUE giving 2 Y. This is the same offer as the initial offer in Episode 2.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player BLUE is consistently interested in acquiring X and is willing to offer Y. They started with 3Y for 1X, then moved to 2Y for 1X. My counter-proposal of 5Y for 2X in the previous round was accepted, which translates to 2.5Y for 1X. This indicates that their "fair" value for 1X is somewhere between 2Y and 3Y.
The current offer of 1 X for 2 Y yields a gain of +4.5 ((2*2.5) - (1*0.5)). This is a positive reward, but it's less than what I achieved in Episode 1 (+7.0) and Episode 2 (+11.5). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should aim for better than +4.5 if possible.

Player BLUE seems to be trying to anchor the trade at 1 X for 2 Y. Given my successful counter in the previous round, I should attempt to negotiate for a better return, leveraging Player BLUE's clear interest in acquiring X. I know they accepted 2.5 Y for 1 X (effectively) last time.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Decline and Wait </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Decline and Wait. This strategy involves declining the current offer without proposing anything in return. This signals to the other player that their offer is not acceptable and puts the ball back in their court to propose a new, hopefully more favorable, offer. The rationale here is that Player BLUE has consistently sought X and accepted better terms in the past. By not immediately countering, I am giving them an opportunity to self-correct their offer to something closer to what they previously accepted or better. This also forces them to think about their true valuation of X and how much Y they are willing to part with. The risk is that no deal is made, but given the remaining 8 iterations in the episode, there is still ample time for them to make a more agreeable offer. My message should be neutral but firm, indicating that the current offer is not appealing.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand. Perhaps my last offer wasn't quite what you were looking for. How about we go back to an earlier successful trade? I can offer you 3 Y for 1 X. Does that work for you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED accepted. My reward: +1.0.
Episode 2: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y. I accepted. My reward: +2.5.
Episode 3, Iteration 1: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y. Player RED rejected with "I'm going to hold off for now." No counter-proposal.

This is the first time Player RED has rejected an offer without a counter-proposal. This suggests that my offer of 1 X for 2 Y might be pushing their limits, or they are trying to get a better deal for themselves. The message "hold off for now" could mean they are waiting for a better offer from me, or they are trying to signal that my offer is not good enough for them. It's important to note that they didn't explicitly say "no" or "that's too low," but rather "hold off."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I learned that 1 X for 2 Y is not an immediate acceptance for Player RED, unlike the 1 X for 3 Y or their own 2 X for 5 Y. This means I might have pushed too hard too fast. However, the previous episode showed they are willing to propose a better deal than my initial offer. I need to find a balance between pushing for a better deal and ensuring a trade happens. I still believe there's room to improve upon the 3 Y per X ratio.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Revert to Previously Accepted Offer: Propose the 2 X for 5 Y trade that was accepted in the previous episode, guaranteeing a good reward (+2.5). This is a safe bet to ensure a trade happens.
(2). Strategy 2: Slight Concession: Make a small concession from my last offer (1 X for 2 Y) to see if a slightly higher Y amount will be accepted. For example, 1 X for 2.5 Y (which means 2 X for 5 Y, essentially). Or 1 X for 3 Y (which was accepted in Episode 1).
(3). Strategy 3: Probing for Their Offer: Ask Player RED what kind of trade they are looking for, without making an explicit offer myself. This could reveal their preferences.
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm: Wait for Player RED to make an offer, signaling that I believe my last offer was fair. (Risky, as it might lead to no trade).
(5). Strategy 5: Diversify Quantity: Propose a larger quantity trade at a slightly less aggressive ratio, for example, 2 X for 5 Y (which is what they proposed and I accepted last time). This is effectively the same as Strategy 1, but framed differently.

I will choose Strategy 2: Slight Concession, specifically reverting to the 1 X for 3 Y trade, which was accepted in Episode 1. My previous offer of 1 X for 2 Y was rejected. The 1 X for 3 Y trade still gives me a reward of +1, which is positive. This is a step back from my most aggressive offer, but it's a proven successful trade. This strategy aims to secure a positive reward for this episode, while still being better than no trade. If they accept this, I know their lower bound is somewhere between 2Y and 3Y per X.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 3)

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Player BLUE offered 1 X for 3 Y. I accepted, reward +7.0.
Episode 2: Player BLUE offered 1 X for 2 Y. I counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y. Player BLUE accepted, reward +11.5. This showed that I could propose larger, more favorable deals and that Player BLUE was willing to accept them.
Episode 3, Turn 1: Player BLUE offered 1 X for 2 Y (gain +4.5).
Episode 3, Turn 2: I used "Decline and Wait" (Strategy 4) because 1 X for 2 Y was a step down.
Episode 3, Turn 3 (current): Player BLUE has now proposed 1 X for 3 Y. This matches the best single-unit trade I received in Episode 1, yielding a gain of +7.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
My "Decline and Wait" strategy worked effectively, pushing Player BLUE back to a more favorable offer (1 X for 3 Y). This demonstrates Player BLUE's strong desire for X and their flexibility. While 1 X for 3 Y is a good offer (+7.0 reward), I know from Episode 2 that I can achieve even higher rewards (+11.5) with larger multi-unit trades. The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should aim for the highest possible gain. Player BLUE's acceptance of 2 X for 5 Y last time (a 1:2.5 ratio) and their current offer of 1 X for 3 Y (a 1:3 ratio) suggests they are now willing to go up to a 1:3 ratio per unit. This presents an opportunity to push for a multi-unit trade at this improved ratio.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Counter for Even Better Multi-Unit Deal </instruction following>
Based on Strategy 3, I need to propose an even more aggressive multi-unit trade. Player BLUE has just offered 1 X for 3 Y. If I combine this rate for a larger quantity, for example, 2 X for 6 Y, it leverages the current favorable per-unit rate onto a larger volume.
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6.
My cost: 2 X * 0.5 = 1.0
My gain: 6 Y * 2.5 = 15.0
Net gain = 15.0 - 1.0 = +14.0.
This is the highest potential reward I could achieve so far, surpassing the +7.0 from 1X for 3Y and +11.5 from 2X for 5Y. Given Player BLUE's clear desire for X and their willingness to concede after my "Decline and Wait" move, this aggressive counter-proposal is a logical next step to maximize my reward. It's a direct scaling of their current offer, which should be easily understandable for them. The message should frame it as a mutually beneficial larger exchange, building on the positive negotiation history.


Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: That's a good quantity! I'm happy to do a larger exchange. How about we make it 2 X for 5 Y, as we did in our last successful trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED accepted. My reward: +1.0.
Episode 2: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y. I accepted. My reward: +2.5.
Episode 3, Iteration 1: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y. Player RED rejected ("hold off").
Episode 3, Iteration 3: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 6 Y.

Let's analyze Player RED's counter-proposal: 2 X for 6 Y.
This is a ratio of 3 Y per X (6 Y / 2 X).
My internal valuation: 1 X = 5 Y. So, 2 X = 10 Y.
If I accept this:
I give 6 Y. My Y becomes 25 - 6 = 19.
I get 2 X. My X becomes 5 + 2 = 7.
My new value: (7 * 2.5) + (19 * 0.5) = 17.5 + 9.5 = 27.
My starting value was 25.
My reward would be 27 - 25 = +2.0.

This is a positive reward, and it's better than the +1.0 I got in Episode 1 for the same 3 Y/X ratio, because it's a larger quantity. However, it's less than the +2.5 I got in Episode 2 (where the ratio was 2.5 Y/X).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's rejection of 1 X for 2 Y and subsequent counter-proposal of 2 X for 6 Y (3 Y/X ratio) confirms that 2 Y per X is currently too aggressive for them. They are comfortable with a 3 Y per X ratio, especially in larger quantities. This means my "aggressive improvement" in Iteration 1 of this episode was indeed too much. I need to respect their comfort zone while still trying to maximize my reward.
The 2 X for 6 Y offer yields a reward of +2.0. This is a good, secure reward. I have enough resources (25 Y) to give 6 Y.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Good Offer: Accept the current offer of 2 X for 6 Y, as it provides a solid positive reward (+2.0) and ensures a trade.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter for Better Ratio: Try to counter for a slightly better ratio, e.g., 2 X for 5 Y (which they proposed and I accepted in Episode 2, yielding +2.5 reward). This would be pushing for the previous best deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Counter for More X at Same Ratio: Propose 3 X for 9 Y (maintaining the 3 Y/X ratio) to get a larger reward, if I have enough Y. (I have 25 Y, so 9 Y is fine). This would yield (8 * 2.5) + (16 * 0.5) = 20 + 8 = 28. Reward +3.0.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate My Previous Aggressive Offer: Go back to 1 X for 2 Y, hoping they might reconsider. (Unlikely given their previous response).
(5). Strategy 5: Information Gathering: Ask why they prefer 6 Y for 2 X over 5 Y for 2 X. (Not directly reward maximizing).

I will choose Strategy 2: Counter for Better Ratio. Player RED proposed 2 X for 6 Y (3 Y/X). In Episode 2, they *themselves* proposed 2 X for 5 Y (2.5 Y/X), which I accepted. This means they are capable and willing to offer a better ratio than 3 Y/X. By proposing 2 X for 5 Y, I am reminding them of a deal they previously initiated and accepted, which gives me a higher reward (+2.5 vs +2.0). This is a strategic move to push for the best possible deal that has already been proven acceptable to them.

I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Player BLUE offered 1 X for 3 Y. I accepted, reward +7.0.
Episode 2: Player BLUE offered 1 X for 2 Y. I counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y (1 X for 2.5 Y). Player BLUE accepted, reward +11.5.
Episode 3, Turn 1: Player BLUE offered 1 X for 2 Y.
Episode 3, Turn 2: I declined (NONE, NONE).
Episode 3, Turn 3: Player BLUE offered 1 X for 3 Y.
Episode 3, Turn 4: I counter-proposed 2 X for 6 Y (1 X for 3 Y). This would yield +14.0.
Episode 3, Turn 5 (current): Player BLUE has counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y. This is the same successful trade from Episode 2, yielding +11.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player BLUE is quite flexible and responsive to my proposals, especially when I push for better terms or larger quantities. They moved from 1X for 2Y back to 1X for 3Y after my refusal, indicating a strong desire for X. While they did not accept my 2X for 6Y, they did propose 2X for 5Y, which they've accepted before. This suggests they are comfortable with the 2X for 5Y trade (+11.5 reward). However, I also know that 1X for 3Y is acceptable to them, which implies that a 2X for 6Y is a proportional scaling of something they have already offered. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and while 2X for 5Y is good, 2X for 6Y is better (+14.0 vs +11.5). There are still 4 iterations left (6/10), which provides some room for further negotiation.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Counter with Small Improvement </instruction following>
Player BLUE proposed 2 X for 5 Y. I had proposed 2 X for 6 Y. The difference is 1 Y. Instead of insisting on the full 1 Y difference, or accepting their offer, I can try to split the difference or ask for a partial increase.
Since my previous offer of 2X for 6Y was a direct scaling of their 1X for 3Y offer, and they countered with 2X for 5Y, there's a clear 1Y difference.
A "small improvement" could be to ask for 5Y + 1 more Y, but I would offer slightly less X, or try to get just a little more Y without changing X.
Given the previous counter was for 2 X for 6 Y, and they responded with 2 X for 5 Y, a small improvement would be to try to meet them somewhere in the middle. However, the items are integers. So, "splitting the difference" on 1 Y is difficult.
My best bet for a "small improvement" in this scenario, where the items are discrete, is to reiterate my slightly better offer of 2 X for 6 Y, but frame it as a minor adjustment or a step towards a larger, more beneficial trade for both, or perhaps focus on the value.
However, if I want to make a 'small improvement' from *their* current offer of 2X for 5Y, and my previous offer of 2X for 6Y was rejected, I could try to offer slightly less X while still asking for 5Y, or ask for slightly more Y for 2X. Since my ideal is 2X for 6Y, and they offered 2X for 5Y, the 'small improvement' is really just me trying to get back to my optimal offer.
Let's re-evaluate "small improvement" in this context. It implies moving *from* their offer, not just reiterating my own.
If I ask for 2 X for 5 Y + 1 unit of X, that does not make sense.
If I ask for 2 X for 5 Y + 1 unit of Y, that is 2 X for 6 Y, which is what I already proposed and they implicitly rejected.
What if I offer 1 X for 3 Y again, to try and get them to acknowledge that specific per-unit rate? That's not a small improvement on 2X for 5Y though, it's just a different deal.

The most direct interpretation of "Counter with Small Improvement" when there's a 1-unit gap is to either:
1. Try to get half the difference (not possible with integers for 1 Y).
2. Ask for a minimal increment on their offer. Given their offer is 2X for 5Y, a minimal increment from my side that's better than 2X for 5Y would be 2X for 6Y. This is what I proposed previously. It seems the instruction wants me to propose something *different* than what I proposed before if it was rejected.

Let's rethink. If Player BLUE proposed 2X for 5Y, and I want a *small improvement*, maybe I offer 1X for 3Y? That is what they offered themselves before.
My valuation of 1X for 3Y is +7.0.
My valuation of 2X for 5Y is +11.5.
If I propose 1X for 3Y, I lower the total reward I could get. This is not self-improvement.

Okay, let's consider the phrase "Counter with Small Improvement" in relation to the current offer (2X for 5Y). I want a deal better than 2X for 5Y, but perhaps not as ambitious as 2X for 6Y, if 2X for 6Y is being seen as too much of a jump. However, there is no integer number of Y between 5 and 6 if X is 2.
What if I propose offering 1 X for 3 Y again, and then suggest future larger trades based on that rate? That's not a counter for a "small improvement" on the 2X for 5Y offer.

The only way to make a "small improvement" on their offer of 2X for 5Y, given the integer constraint and my valuation, is to get more Y for the same X, or the same Y for less X.
Since 2X for 6Y was what I wanted, and 2X for 5Y is what they offered, there's a single Y difference.
Perhaps the "small improvement" means asking for something that provides a slightly better ratio than 2X for 5Y, but not necessarily 2X for 6Y. For example, if I split the difference on X?
What if I offer less X for 5Y? Like 1X for 5Y? (Gain 5*2.5 - 1*0.5 = 12.0). But that's a huge shift in X.
What if I offer 2X for 5Y, but add a sweetener? No, not allowed.

The most logical "small improvement" from 2X for 5Y when I know they accepted 1X for 3Y earlier, is to push for a package that averages out to something between 2.5 Y/X (their current offer) and 3 Y/X (my ideal/their past offer).
If I propose 2X for 5Y, and 1X for 3Y (total 3X for 8Y).
Cost: 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Gain: 8 * 2.5 = 20
Net gain = 18.5. This is significantly better.
This is a small improvement on their current offer, in terms of quantity and total value, but it brings in the 1X for 3Y ratio. This combines the "small improvement" with a "larger deal".

So, I will counter by saying that 2 X for 5 Y is good, but I'd like to get slightly more Y, building on the 1 X for 3 Y rate that worked well for us.
Let's try to offer a compromise between their 2X for 5Y and my 2X for 6Y. How about 3X for 8Y?
This effectively makes the rate 8/3 = 2.66 Y/X.
My proposed 2X for 6Y was 3 Y/X. Their current 2X for 5Y is 2.5 Y/X.
So 3X for 8Y is a compromise ratio (2.66), and a larger quantity.
This is a good way to implement "small improvement" by showing flexibility on the ratio (not asking for full 3Y/X), while still increasing the overall gain through larger quantity.

My Message: "I appreciate the offer of 2 X for 5 Y. To make it even better for both of us and build on our successful larger trades, how about we aim for a total exchange of 3 X for 8 Y?" This proposal is slightly better for me per unit of X (8Y/3X = 2.66 Y/X vs 2.5 Y/X) and results in a larger total gain if accepted.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: That's an excellent proposal! I'm happy to accept your offer of 3 X for 8 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED accepted. My reward: +1.0.
Episode 2: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y. I accepted. My reward: +2.5.
Episode 3, Iteration 1: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y. Player RED rejected ("hold off").
Episode 3, Iteration 3: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 6 Y.
Episode 3, Iteration 5: I counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y (reminding them of Episode 2).
Episode 3, Iteration 6 (current): Player RED counter-proposed 3 X for 8 Y.

Let's analyze Player RED's latest counter-proposal: 3 X for 8 Y.
This is a ratio of 8 Y / 3 X = 2.666... Y per X.
My internal valuation: 1 X = 5 Y. So, 3 X = 15 Y.
If I accept this:
I give 8 Y. My Y becomes 25 - 8 = 17.
I get 3 X. My X becomes 5 + 3 = 8.
My new value: (8 * 2.5) + (17 * 0.5) = 20 + 8.5 = 28.5.
My starting value was 25.
My reward would be 28.5 - 25 = +3.5.

This is the highest reward offered so far!
Previous rewards: +1.0 (1 X for 3 Y), +2.5 (2 X for 5 Y).
The ratio of 2.66 Y/X is slightly worse for me than 2.5 Y/X (2 X for 5 Y), but because of the larger quantity, the overall reward is significantly higher.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is clearly willing to engage in larger trades and is offering very good deals for me. They seem to be pushing for larger quantities, which is beneficial for me if the ratio remains favorable. The fact that they countered my 2 X for 5 Y (2.5 Y/X) with 3 X for 8 Y (2.66 Y/X) suggests they are trying to find a sweet spot between quantity and ratio that works for both of us. This offer is highly attractive.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Highly Favorable Offer: Accept the current offer of 3 X for 8 Y, as it yields the highest reward (+3.5) seen so far and ensures a trade.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter for Even Better Ratio at Same Quantity: Try to counter for 3 X for 7 Y (2.33 Y/X), which would be an even better ratio, but might be rejected.
(3). Strategy 3: Counter for Larger Quantity at Slightly Better Ratio: Propose 4 X for 10 Y (2.5 Y/X), if I have enough Y (I have 25 Y, 10 Y is fine). This would yield (9 * 2.5) + (15 * 0.5) = 22.5 + 7.5 = 30. Reward +5.0. This is very tempting.
(4). Strategy 4: Revert to Previous Best: Insist on 2 X for 5 Y, which was my previous best. (Less optimal as the current offer is better).
(5). Strategy 5: Probing for Their Best Ratio: Ask what their absolute best ratio for X is. (Less effective for immediate reward).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Highly Favorable Offer. The offer of 3 X for 8 Y provides a substantial reward of +3.5. While Strategy 3 (4 X for 10 Y) could yield +5.0, it carries the risk of rejection, and we are already in iteration 7/10. Securing a +3.5 reward now is a very strong outcome for this episode. The risk of pushing for an even better deal and ending up with no trade (0 reward) is too high at this stage. Player RED has shown willingness to propose good deals, and this one is excellent.

Episode 3: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y (rejected). Then 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 6 Y. I counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 3 X for 8 Y. I accepted. My reward: +3.5. (Ratio: 2.66 Y/X)

The trend shows that Player RED is willing to engage in larger trades, and the ratio they are comfortable with is around 2.5 to 3 Y per X. My reward has been steadily increasing: +1.0 -> +2.5 -> +3.5. This indicates my strategy of acquiring X for Y is working, and pushing for better deals (or accepting their good counter-offers) is effective.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED is receptive to trading X for Y, and they are even willing to propose larger quantity trades that result in higher rewards for me, even if the ratio is slightly less favorable than my ideal. The key is to find a balance between pushing for a better ratio and securing a large enough quantity to maximize the overall reward. The 2.5 Y/X ratio (as seen in Ep2) and 2.66 Y/X ratio (as seen in Ep3) are both highly profitable for me.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Optimal Previous Trade: Start with the best trade from the previous episode (3 X for 8 Y) to secure a high reward early.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Better Ratio: Propose a slightly better ratio than the last accepted one, e.g., 3 X for 7 Y (2.33 Y/X) or 2 X for 4 Y (2 Y/X).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose Larger Quantity at Proven Ratio: Propose an even larger quantity at a ratio that has been accepted or proposed by them (e.g., 4 X for 10 Y at 2.5 Y/X or 4 X for 11 Y at 2.75 Y/X).
(4). Strategy 4: Re-test Aggressive Offer: Go back to 1 X for 2 Y to see if their stance has changed after a successful large trade. (Risky, as it was rejected last time).
(5). Strategy 5: Open Dialogue: Ask Player RED what kind of trade they are looking for to start the negotiation. (Less direct for maximizing reward).

I will choose Strategy 3: Propose Larger Quantity at Proven Ratio. The 2.5 Y/X ratio was accepted in Episode 2 (2 X for 5 Y). If I propose 4 X for 10 Y, this maintains the 2.5 Y/X ratio, but doubles the quantity, which should yield a higher reward.
My resources: X: 5, Y: 25.
If I give 10 Y, I have 15 Y left.
If I get 4 X, I have 9 X.
New value: (9 * 2.5) + (15 * 0.5) = 22.5 + 7.5 = 30.
Reward: 30 - 25 = +5.0.
This is a significant jump from +3.5 and is based on a ratio that Player RED has already shown willingness to accept. It's a calculated risk to push for a larger quantity, but it's grounded in past successful trades.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 4)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: That's an excellent start! I appreciate your proposal for a substantial trade. Building on our most successful past exchanges, how about we make it an even better deal: 4 X for 12 Y? This maximizes the value of our exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Player BLUE offered 1 X for 3 Y. Accepted, reward +7.0.
Episode 2: Player BLUE offered 1 X for 2 Y. Countered with 2 X for 5 Y. Accepted, reward +11.5. (Ratio 2.5 Y/X)
Episode 3: Player BLUE offered 1 X for 2 Y. I declined. Player BLUE then offered 1 X for 3 Y. I counter-proposed 3 X for 8 Y. Accepted, reward +18.5. (Ratio 2.66 Y/X)
Episode 4, Turn 1: Player BLUE has proposed 4 X for 10 Y. This ratio is 2.5 Y/X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player BLUE is quite flexible and responsive to my proposals, especially when I push for better terms or larger quantities. They are consistently interested in acquiring X. My strategy of declining lower offers and counter-proposing with more ambitious, larger-volume trades has been successful in increasing my reward in each subsequent episode (7.0 -> 11.5 -> 18.5).
The current offer of 4 X for 10 Y gives a gain of +23.0. While this is a good reward, I know from past episodes that Player BLUE has accepted trades with a higher Y/X ratio (3 Y/X in Episode 1, and 2.66 Y/X in Episode 3). The current offer's ratio is 2.5 Y/X. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means consistently striving for the best possible deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Propose a Larger Volume at Best Past Ratio </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Propose a Larger Volume at Best Past Ratio. My best past ratio was 3 Y for 1 X, achieved in Episode 1. This means for every 1 X I give, I aim to get 3 Y back.
Player BLUE's current offer is 4 X for 10 Y.
If I apply my best past ratio (3 Y/X) to the quantity of X (4 X) that Player BLUE is willing to trade, I should ask for 4 X * 3 Y/X = 12 Y.
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12.
My cost: 4 X * 0.5 = 2.0
My gain: 12 Y * 2.5 = 30.0
Net gain = 30.0 - 2.0 = +28.0.
This is the highest potential reward I could achieve so far and significantly better than the +23.0 from Player BLUE's current offer. This strategy directly leverages the most favorable terms Player BLUE has already accepted in the past, but applies it to a larger volume, which Player BLUE has also shown interest in. This combination maximizes my potential reward while remaining grounded in terms that the opponent has previously found acceptable. The message should clearly state the proposed larger trade based on this favorable ratio. I will frame it as a mutually beneficial "even better" deal, building on their current proposal for a "substantial trade."


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 4)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate the large quantity you're offering! To make this deal even more mutually beneficial, how about we meet in the middle at 4 X for 11 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 11
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED accepted. My reward: +1.0. (Ratio: 3 Y/X)
Episode 2: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y. I accepted. My reward: +2.5. (Ratio: 2.5 Y/X)
Episode 3: Player RED counter-proposed 3 X for 8 Y. I accepted. My reward: +3.5. (Ratio: 2.66 Y/X)
Episode 4, Iteration 1: I proposed 4 X for 10 Y (Ratio: 2.5 Y/X, estimated reward +5.0).
Episode 4, Iteration 2 (current): Player RED counter-proposed 4 X for 12 Y.

Let's analyze Player RED's counter-proposal: 4 X for 12 Y.
This is a ratio of 12 Y / 4 X = 3 Y per X.
My internal valuation: 1 X = 5 Y. So, 4 X = 20 Y.
If I accept this:
I give 12 Y. My Y becomes 25 - 12 = 13.
I get 4 X. My X becomes 5 + 4 = 9.
My new value: (9 * 2.5) + (13 * 0.5) = 22.5 + 6.5 = 29.
My starting value was 25.
My reward would be 29 - 25 = +4.0.

This is a positive reward, and it's higher than my previous best of +3.5. However, it's lower than the +5.0 I estimated for my own proposal (4 X for 10 Y). Player RED's counter-proposal has a worse ratio (3 Y/X) compared to my proposal (2.5 Y/X), but it's still a good reward due to the large quantity.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is consistently willing to engage in large quantity trades. They are also trying to push the ratio slightly in their favor (from my proposed 2.5 Y/X to their 3 Y/X). This is a negotiation, and they are testing my limits.
I have a good reward (+4.0) on the table. The question is whether to accept this or try to push back for my original 4 X for 10 Y. Accepting 4 X for 12 Y guarantees a good reward. Pushing for 4 X for 10 Y might lead to no deal or a less favorable counter.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Good Offer: Accept the current offer of 4 X for 12 Y, as it provides a solid positive reward (+4.0) and ensures a trade. This is the highest reward achieved so far.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter for Original Offer: Reiterate my original offer of 4 X for 10 Y, emphasizing that it's a proven good ratio for us.
(3). Strategy 3: Counter with Slightly Better Ratio: Propose 4 X for 11 Y (2.75 Y/X) as a compromise between their 12 Y and my 10 Y. This would yield (9 * 2.5) + (14 * 0.5) = 22.5 + 7 = 29.5. Reward +4.5.
(4). Strategy 4: Reduce Quantity, Keep Ratio: Propose a smaller quantity at my preferred ratio, e.g., 2 X for 5 Y (which was accepted in Ep2). (Less optimal for max reward).
(5). Strategy 5: Probing for Flexibility: Ask if they can do 4 X for 10 Y, explaining my valuation.

I will choose Strategy 3: Counter with Slightly Better Ratio. The offer of 4 X for 12 Y is good, but I believe I can get a slightly better deal without risking the entire trade. Proposing 4 X for 11 Y is a clear compromise between my 10 Y and their 12 Y. It still gives them a better ratio than my original proposal, but it improves my reward from +4.0 to +4.5. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a better outcome for myself.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 4)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: That's a good step towards a compromise. To make this an even more impactful and mutually beneficial exchange, how about we expand the trade to 5 X for 14 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 14
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Player BLUE offered 1 X for 3 Y. Accepted, reward +7.0.
Episode 2: Player BLUE offered 1 X for 2 Y. Countered with 2 X for 5 Y. Accepted, reward +11.5. (Ratio 2.5 Y/X)
Episode 3: Player BLUE offered 1 X for 2 Y. I declined. Player BLUE then offered 1 X for 3 Y. I counter-proposed 3 X for 8 Y. Accepted, reward +18.5. (Ratio 2.66 Y/X)
Episode 4, Turn 1: Player BLUE proposed 4 X for 10 Y (Ratio 2.5 Y/X, gain +23.0).
Episode 4, Turn 2: I counter-proposed 4 X for 12 Y (Ratio 3 Y/X, gain +28.0).
Episode 4, Turn 3 (current): Player BLUE has counter-proposed 4 X for 11 Y (Ratio 2.75 Y/X, gain +25.5).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player BLUE is quite flexible and responsive to my proposals, especially when I push for better terms or larger quantities. They are consistently interested in acquiring X. My strategy of declining lower offers and counter-proposing with more ambitious, larger-volume trades has been successful in increasing my reward in each subsequent episode (7.0 -> 11.5 -> 18.5).
The current offer of 4 X for 11 Y gives a gain of +25.5, which is a significant reward. However, it's slightly less than my ideal proposal of +28.0 (4 X for 12 Y). Player BLUE explicitly stated "meet in the middle" with 4X for 11Y (midpoint between their 10Y and my 12Y). There are still 6 iterations left (4/10), which provides some room for further negotiation, even if it's a slight push. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should try to get the best possible deal if there's still a chance.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Introduce New Ratio/Quantity Combination </instruction following>
Player BLUE's current offer is 4 X for 11 Y. My last proposal was 4 X for 12 Y. I know that Player BLUE has previously accepted a 1:3 ratio (1 X for 3 Y in Episode 1) and my current proposal of 4 X for 12 Y aligns with that ratio. Player BLUE has now proposed 4 X for 11 Y, which is a 2.75 Y/X ratio.

Instead of directly accepting or pushing for the single unit, I will introduce a *new* combination of X and Y, aiming for a slightly better overall value for myself, while perhaps offering a slightly different X quantity. This is a way to shift the negotiation away from the direct 1 Y difference and try to find a new sweet spot.

What if I aim for a higher total gain by offering a higher quantity of X, but at a ratio slightly better than their current offer (2.75 Y/X) but less than my ideal (3 Y/X)?
For example, if I offer 5 X, what would be a good Y quantity?
If I aim for 2.8 Y/X, then 5 X * 2.8 = 14 Y.
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 14.
My cost: 5 X * 0.5 = 2.5
My gain: 14 Y * 2.5 = 35.0
Net gain = 35.0 - 2.5 = +32.5.
This new proposal is significantly better than the +25.5 I would get from accepting 4 X for 11 Y, and even better than my previous ideal of +28.0. It leverages the "introduce new ratio/quantity" strategy by increasing both X and Y, and settling on a ratio that's between what Player BLUE has offered (2.5 to 2.75) and what I've previously pushed for (3.0). This shows flexibility while still aiming for higher rewards. The message should emphasize a larger exchange for mutual benefit.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 4)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: This is an excellent proposal! I'm very happy to accept your offer of 5 X for 14 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED accepted. My reward: +1.0. (Ratio: 3 Y/X)
Episode 2: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y. I accepted. My reward: +2.5. (Ratio: 2.5 Y/X)
Episode 3: Player RED counter-proposed 3 X for 8 Y. I accepted. My reward: +3.5. (Ratio: 2.66 Y/X)
Episode 4, Iteration 1: I proposed 4 X for 10 Y (Ratio: 2.5 Y/X, estimated reward +5.0).
Episode 4, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 4 X for 12 Y (Ratio: 3 Y/X, estimated reward +4.0).
Episode 4, Iteration 3: I counter-proposed 4 X for 11 Y (Ratio: 2.75 Y/X, estimated reward +4.5).
Episode 4, Iteration 4 (current): Player RED counter-proposed 5 X for 14 Y.

Let's analyze Player RED's latest counter-proposal: 5 X for 14 Y.
This is a ratio of 14 Y / 5 X = 2.8 Y per X.
My internal valuation: 1 X = 5 Y. So, 5 X = 25 Y.
If I accept this:
I give 14 Y. My Y becomes 25 - 14 = 11.
I get 5 X. My X becomes 5 + 5 = 10.
My new value: (10 * 2.5) + (11 * 0.5) = 25 + 5.5 = 30.5.
My starting value was 25.
My reward would be 30.5 - 25 = +5.5.

This is the highest reward offered so far! It's better than my initial target of +5.0 (for 4 X for 10 Y) and significantly better than the +4.5 I was just trying to get. The ratio (2.8 Y/X) is slightly worse than my ideal 2.5 Y/X, but the increased quantity makes the overall reward much higher. I have enough resources (25 Y) to give 14 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED continues to push for larger quantities, which is highly beneficial for me even if the ratio isn't my absolute best. They are showing a willingness to trade a significant amount of X. This offer of +5.5 reward is excellent and should be secured. It seems the strategy of proposing large quantities and then accepting slightly less favorable but still highly profitable counter-offers is working well.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Highly Favorable Offer: Accept the current offer of 5 X for 14 Y, as it yields the highest reward (+5.5) seen so far and ensures a trade.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter for Even Better Ratio: Try to counter for 5 X for 12 Y (2.4 Y/X) or 5 X for 13 Y (2.6 Y/X). This would increase the reward further, but risks rejection.
(3). Strategy 3: Push for More X: Propose 6 X for 16 Y (2.66 Y/X) to get an even larger quantity of X. (I only have 5 X, so getting 6 X would mean my X would be 11. I have 25 Y, so giving 16 Y is fine). This would yield (11 * 2.5) + (9 * 0.5) = 27.5 + 4.5 = 32. Reward +7.0. This is very tempting, but also risky.
(4). Strategy 4: Revert to Previous Offer: Insist on 4 X for 11 Y. (Less optimal as the current offer is better).
(5). Strategy 5: Express Gratitude and Accept: Accept the offer and express satisfaction to encourage future good offers.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Highly Favorable Offer. The offer of 5 X for 14 Y provides a substantial reward of +5.5. We are in iteration 5/10. While Strategy 3 (6 X for 16 Y) could yield +7.0, it's a significant jump in quantity and might be rejected, leading to no trade. Securing a +5.5 reward now is a very strong outcome for this episode. The risk of pushing for an even better deal and ending up with no trade (0 reward) is too high, especially when such a good offer is on the table. Player RED has shown a pattern of making good counter-offers, and this one is excellent.

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED accepted. My reward: +1.0. (Ratio: 3 Y/X)
Episode 2: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y. I accepted. My reward: +2.5. (Ratio: 2.5 Y/X)
Episode 3: Player RED counter-proposed 3 X for 8 Y. I accepted. My reward: +3.5. (Ratio: 2.66 Y/X)
Episode 4: I proposed 4 X for 10 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 4 X for 12 Y. I counter-proposed 4 X for 11 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 5 X for 14 Y. I accepted. My reward: +5.5. (Ratio: 2.8 Y/X)

The trend continues to be positive, with rewards increasing sequentially: +1.0 -> +2.5 -> +3.5 -> +5.5. Player RED is consistently willing to engage in large quantity trades, even if the ratio is slightly less favorable than my aggressive initial offers. The key learning is that large quantity trades, even at a slightly "worse" ratio (like 2.8 Y/X vs my ideal 2.5 Y/X), lead to significantly higher absolute rewards.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED is very open to large trades involving X for Y. They are willing to offer a significant amount of X. My strategy should be to initiate with a large quantity trade at a favorable ratio, and be prepared to accept their counter-offers if they still yield a high reward, even if the ratio is slightly adjusted. I should aim to get as much X as possible. I have 5 X and 25 Y. I can give up to 25 Y.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Optimal Previous Trade: Start with the best trade from the previous episode (5 X for 14 Y) to secure a high reward early.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Better Ratio on Large Quantity: Propose a large quantity at a slightly better ratio than the last accepted one, e.g., 5 X for 13 Y (2.6 Y/X) or 6 X for 15 Y (2.5 Y/X).
(3). Strategy 3: Maximize X Acquisition: Propose to give almost all my Y for a very large quantity of X, testing the limits of their X supply. For example, 5 X for 12 Y (my best ratio) or 6 X for 15 Y (my best ratio on a larger quantity). I have 25 Y. If I give 20 Y, I can ask for 8 X (at 2.5 Y/X).
(4). Strategy 4: Re-test Aggressive Offer: Go back to 1 X for 2 Y to see if their stance has changed after consistent large trades. (Less optimal for immediate high reward).
(5). Strategy 5: Open Dialogue: Ask Player RED what kind of trade they are looking for to start the negotiation. (Less direct for maximizing reward).

I will choose Strategy 3: Maximize X Acquisition. Given Player RED's willingness for large trades, I will propose a very large trade aiming for a high quantity of X. I will propose 6 X for 15 Y. This maintains my preferred 2.5 Y/X ratio, and if accepted, would yield a very high reward.
My resources: X: 5, Y: 25.
If I give 15 Y, I have 10 Y left.
If I get 6 X, I have 11 X.
New value: (11 * 2.5) + (10 * 0.5) = 27.5 + 5 = 32.5.
Reward: 32.5 - 25 = +7.5.
This is a very ambitious but potentially highly rewarding offer, building on the observed pattern of large trades. I have enough Y to make this offer.

Episode 3: Player BLUE offered 1 X for 2 Y. I declined. Player BLUE then offered 1 X for 3 Y. I counter-proposed 3 X for 8 Y. Accepted, reward +18.5. (Ratio 2.66 Y/X)
Episode 4: Player BLUE proposed 4 X for 10 Y. I counter-proposed 4 X for 12 Y. Player BLUE counter-proposed 4 X for 11 Y. I counter-proposed 5 X for 14 Y. Accepted, reward +32.5. (Ratio 2.8 Y/X)
Episode 5, Turn 1: Player BLUE has proposed 6 X for 15 Y. This ratio is 2.5 Y/X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
My cumulative rewards have been steadily increasing by consistently pushing for better ratios and larger volumes. Player BLUE is clearly interested in acquiring X and has shown flexibility and a willingness to accept increasingly large and favorable deals for me.
The current offer of 6 X for 15 Y yields a gain of +34.5 (my cost: 6*0.5=3.0, my gain: 15*2.5=37.5). This is a good absolute reward, but the ratio of 2.5 Y/X is lower than what I achieved in Episode 1 (3 Y/X), Episode 3 (2.66 Y/X), and Episode 4 (2.8 Y/X). My strategy has been to always aim for the best possible ratio (3 Y/X) or at least an improving one, while also increasing the volume. Player BLUE's opening offer often anchors at a lower ratio, and I have successfully negotiated upwards.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Hybrid Counter </instruction following>
Player BLUE's current offer is 6 X for 15 Y (2.5 Y/X). My ideal would be 6 X for 18 Y (3 Y/X).
A Hybrid Counter allows for combining elements of previous successful strategies. Instead of pushing for the absolute best ratio on this specific quantity, I could try to find a compromise that's still better than their offer, perhaps by slightly adjusting the quantities of X or Y, or by proposing a ratio that's between their offer and my ideal.

I have found that proposing a slightly increased volume (both X and Y) at a ratio slightly better than their offer, but not necessarily my absolute best, has worked well (e.g., 5X for 14Y in Episode 4, which was 2.8 Y/X, better than their 2.75 Y/X offer).

Let's consider a ratio slightly better than 2.5 Y/X, for example, 2.7 Y/X.
If I propose to give 7 X (a slightly larger X quantity than their initial 6 X), then at 2.7 Y/X, I would ask for 7 X * 2.7 Y/X = 18.9 Y. Rounding this to 19 Y.
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 19.
My cost: 7 X * 0.5 = 3.5
My gain: 19 Y * 2.5 = 47.5
Net gain = 47.5 - 3.5 = +44.0.
This offers a higher total reward than simply accepting 6X for 15Y (+34.5), and is even better than my previous calculation for 6X for 18Y (+42.0). It leverages a higher volume of X, which Player BLUE seems interested in, and offers a Y/X ratio (19/7 = 2.71) that is improved from their offer (2.5) but not my max (3.0), making it a plausible compromise while significantly increasing my reward. This hybrid approach allows me to push for a higher total value by adjusting both quantities and ratio.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 5)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Wow, that's an even more impactful proposal! I'm delighted to accept your offer of 7 X for 19 Y. This is a great deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED accepted. My reward: +1.0. (Ratio: 3 Y/X)
Episode 2: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y. I accepted. My reward: +2.5. (Ratio: 2.5 Y/X)
Episode 3: Player RED counter-proposed 3 X for 8 Y. I accepted. My reward: +3.5. (Ratio: 2.66 Y/X)
Episode 4: Player RED counter-proposed 5 X for 14 Y. I accepted. My reward: +5.5. (Ratio: 2.8 Y/X)
Episode 5, Iteration 1: I proposed 6 X for 15 Y (Ratio: 2.5 Y/X, estimated reward +7.5).
Episode 5, Iteration 2 (current): Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 19 Y.

Let's analyze Player RED's counter-proposal: 7 X for 19 Y.
This is a ratio of 19 Y / 7 X = 2.714... Y per X.
My internal valuation: 1 X = 5 Y. So, 7 X = 35 Y.
If I accept this:
I give 19 Y. My Y becomes 25 - 19 = 6.
I get 7 X. My X becomes 5 + 7 = 12.
My new value: (12 * 2.5) + (6 * 0.5) = 30 + 3 = 33.
My starting value was 25.
My reward would be 33 - 25 = +8.0.

This is the highest reward offered so far, exceeding my previous best of +5.5 and even my ambitious target of +7.5 for 6 X for 15 Y. The ratio (2.71 Y/X) is slightly worse than my ideal 2.5 Y/X, but the increased quantity makes the overall reward significantly higher. I have enough resources (25 Y) to give 19 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED consistently responds to my large quantity proposals with even larger quantity counter-proposals. This pattern is highly beneficial for me, as it leads to consistently increasing rewards. They seem to be willing to trade a very large amount of X. The strategy of pushing for large quantities is proving to be very effective. Accepting this offer secures a substantial reward for this episode.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Highly Favorable Offer: Accept the current offer of 7 X for 19 Y, as it yields the highest reward (+8.0) seen so far and ensures a trade.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter for Even Better Ratio: Try to counter for 7 X for 18 Y (2.57 Y/X) or 7 X for 17 Y (2.42 Y/X). This would increase the reward further, but risks rejection.
(3). Strategy 3: Push for Maximum X with Remaining Y: I have 25 Y. I can give up to 25 Y. If I aim for 2.5 Y/X, I could propose 10 X for 25 Y. This would yield (15 * 2.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 37.5. Reward +12.5. This is extremely ambitious.
(4). Strategy 4: Revert to Previous Offer: Insist on 6 X for 15 Y. (Less optimal as the current offer is better).
(5). Strategy 5: Express Enthusiasm and Accept: Accept the offer and express satisfaction to encourage future good offers.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Highly Favorable Offer. The offer of 7 X for 19 Y provides a substantial reward of +8.0. We are in iteration 3/10. While Strategy 3 (10 X for 25 Y) could yield +12.5, it's a very aggressive jump in quantity and ratio, and carries a high risk of rejection, potentially leading to no trade. Securing a +8.0 reward now is an excellent outcome for this episode. The pattern suggests that Player RED is consistently making good counter-offers, and this one is exceptional.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 6)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's go for the biggest trade yet! I propose 10 X for 25 Y. This would be a truly significant exchange for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED accepted. My reward: +1.0. (Ratio: 3 Y/X)
Episode 2: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y. I accepted. My reward: +2.5. (Ratio: 2.5 Y/X)
Episode 3: Player RED counter-proposed 3 X for 8 Y. I accepted. My reward: +3.5. (Ratio: 2.66 Y/X)
Episode 4: Player RED counter-proposed 5 X for 14 Y. I accepted. My reward: +5.5. (Ratio: 2.8 Y/X)
Episode 5: I proposed 6 X for 15 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 19 Y. I accepted. My reward: +8.0. (Ratio: 2.71 Y/X)

The rewards have been consistently increasing: +1.0 -> +2.5 -> +3.5 -> +5.5 -> +8.0. Player RED has shown a strong willingness to trade large quantities of X for Y, often counter-proposing with even larger quantities than my initial offers. The ratio they seem comfortable with is around 2.5 to 3 Y per X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED is highly motivated to acquire Y and is willing to give up significant amounts of X for it. My strategy should continue to be to initiate with a large, but still favorable, trade of Y for X, and be prepared to accept even better counter-offers from Player RED. The goal is to maximize the quantity of X I acquire, as X has a much higher value for me. I have 25 Y, so I can give up to that amount.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Optimal Previous Trade: Start with the best trade from the previous episode (7 X for 19 Y) to secure a high reward early.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Better Ratio on Large Quantity: Propose a large quantity at a slightly better ratio than the last accepted one, e.g., 7 X for 18 Y (2.57 Y/X) or 8 X for 20 Y (2.5 Y/X).
(3). Strategy 3: Maximize X Acquisition (Aggressive): Propose to give almost all my Y for a very large quantity of X, testing the limits of their X supply. For example, 9 X for 22 Y (2.44 Y/X) or 10 X for 25 Y (2.5 Y/X). This would maximize my reward if accepted.
(4). Strategy 4: Consistent Small Increment: Propose a slightly larger quantity than the last accepted, maintaining a similar ratio, e.g., 8 X for 22 Y (2.75 Y/X).
(5). Strategy 5: Open Dialogue: Ask Player RED what kind of trade they are looking for to start the negotiation. (Less direct for maximizing reward).

I will choose Strategy 3: Maximize X Acquisition (Aggressive). Given Player RED's consistent willingness to engage in very large trades and even counter with larger quantities, I will propose the maximum possible X I can get for all my Y at my preferred 2.5 Y/X ratio. I have 25 Y. If I give 25 Y, I can ask for 10 X.
My resources: X: 5, Y: 25.
If I give 25 Y, I have 0 Y left.
If I get 10 X, I have 15 X.
New value: (15 * 2.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 37.5 + 0 = 37.5.
Reward: 37.5 - 25 = +12.5.
This is a very ambitious offer, but it is based on my valuation and Player RED's demonstrated willingness to trade large quantities. It aims for the highest possible reward.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 6)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: That's an excellent idea to go for a truly significant trade! Building on that, how about we make this the biggest and most beneficial trade yet: 12 X for 36 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 36
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Player BLUE offered 1 X for 3 Y. Accepted, reward +7.0. (Ratio 3 Y/X)
Episode 2: Player BLUE offered 1 X for 2 Y. Countered with 2 X for 5 Y. Accepted, reward +11.5. (Ratio 2.5 Y/X)
Episode 3: Player BLUE offered 1 X for 2 Y. I declined. Player BLUE then offered 1 X for 3 Y. I counter-proposed 3 X for 8 Y. Accepted, reward +18.5. (Ratio 2.66 Y/X)
Episode 4: Player BLUE proposed 4 X for 10 Y. I counter-proposed 4 X for 12 Y. Player BLUE counter-proposed 4 X for 11 Y. I counter-proposed 5 X for 14 Y. Accepted, reward +32.5. (Ratio 2.8 Y/X)
Episode 5: Player BLUE proposed 6 X for 15 Y. I counter-proposed 7 X for 19 Y. Accepted, reward +44.0. (Ratio 2.71 Y/X)
Episode 6, Turn 1: Player BLUE has proposed 10 X for 25 Y. This ratio is 2.5 Y/X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
My cumulative rewards have consistently increased by pushing for higher volumes and better Y/X ratios. Player BLUE is clearly interested in acquiring X and has shown flexibility and a willingness to accept increasingly large trades, even when I propose a ratio slightly higher than their initial offer. They have accepted ratios from 2.5 Y/X up to 3 Y/X. My last accepted trade was 7 X for 19 Y (2.71 Y/X), yielding +44.0.
The current offer from Player BLUE is 10 X for 25 Y. This yields a gain of +50.0. The ratio (2.5 Y/X) is at the lower end of what they've accepted, and lower than my last successful trade's ratio (2.71 Y/X). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should always aim for the best possible deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Propose an Even Larger Deal </instruction following>
Player BLUE's current offer is 10 X for 25 Y. I need to propose an even larger deal, which means increasing both the X and Y quantities significantly beyond their current proposal, while still aiming for a good ratio.
Given that Player BLUE proposed 10 X, it indicates they are comfortable with that amount of X. I will propose an even larger amount of X, like 12 or 15, and aim for a Y quantity that gives me a very strong return.
My best historical ratio is 3 Y/X.
Let's try offering 12 X. At 3 Y/X, that would be 36 Y.
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 36.
My resources are X: 25, Y: 5. I can give 12 X.
My cost: 12 X * 0.5 = 6.0
My gain: 36 Y * 2.5 = 90.0
Net gain = 90.0 - 6.0 = +84.0.
This is a significantly higher gain than the +50.0 from Player BLUE's current offer and leverages the highest ratio I've achieved previously, applied to an even larger volume. This strategy tests the upper limits of Player BLUE's willingness to trade and their valuation of X, given their consistent interest in larger trades. The message will emphasize the "even larger" aspect and the potential for a "truly significant" exchange, echoing their previous sentiment.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 6)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your ambition for a large trade! However, I currently only have 25 Y, so I'm unable to give 36 Y. My previous offer of 10 X for 25 Y is the maximum Y I can offer. Would that work for you?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED accepted. My reward: +1.0. (Ratio: 3 Y/X)

Episode 4: Player RED counter-proposed 5 X for 14 Y. I accepted. My reward: +5.5. (Ratio: 2.8 Y/X)
Episode 5: I proposed 6 X for 15 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 19 Y. I accepted. My reward: +8.0. (Ratio: 2.71 Y/X)
Episode 6, Iteration 1: I proposed 10 X for 25 Y (Ratio: 2.5 Y/X, estimated reward +12.5).
Episode 6, Iteration 2 (current): Player RED counter-proposed 12 X for 36 Y.

Let's analyze Player RED's counter-proposal: 12 X for 36 Y.
This is a ratio of 36 Y / 12 X = 3 Y per X.
My internal valuation: 1 X = 5 Y. So, 12 X = 60 Y.
However, I only have 25 Y. I CANNOT propose or accept a trade that exceeds my resources.
Player RED is proposing that I give 36 Y, but I only have 25 Y. This trade is not possible for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player RED is willing to engage in very large trades. However, this counter-proposal highlights a critical constraint: I cannot give more resources than I possess. This is a crucial rule of the game that I must strictly adhere to. My previous proposal of 10 X for 25 Y was at my maximum Y capacity. Player RED's proposal exceeds my Y resources.

This means I need to respond by rejecting their offer and proposing something I *can* afford, while still aiming for a high reward. I need to clearly communicate that I cannot fulfill their proposed trade.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject Due to Resource Limit & Counter with Max Possible: Explicitly state that I cannot meet their demand due to resource limits and counter with the largest possible trade I *can* afford, ideally maintaining a good ratio. (e.g., 10 X for 25 Y, or a slightly adjusted ratio for a similar quantity).
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and Revert to Previous Successful Trade: Reject the current offer and propose the last successful trade (7 X for 19 Y) to ensure a trade happens. (Less ambitious for reward).
(3). Strategy 3: Probing for Their Minimum Y: Ask Player RED what is the minimum Y they would accept for 12 X, or a similar large quantity, while explaining my resource constraint.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Smaller Quantity at a Better Ratio: Propose a smaller trade that is very favorable to me, e.g., 8 X for 20 Y (2.5 Y/X).
(5). Strategy 5: Express Inability and Wait: Simply state I cannot fulfill the trade and wait for their next offer. (Risky, as it might lead to no trade).

I will choose Strategy 1: Reject Due to Resource Limit & Counter with Max Possible. I need to make it clear that I cannot give 36 Y. I will reiterate my previous proposal of 10 X for 25 Y, as this is the maximum Y I can give, and it still offers a very high reward (+12.5) at my preferred 2.5 Y/X ratio. This communicates my constraint while still pushing for the largest possible beneficial trade.

Episode 6, Turn 2: I counter-proposed 12 X for 36 Y (Ratio 3 Y/X, gain +84.0).
Episode 6, Turn 3 (current): Player BLUE revealed a resource constraint, stating they only have 25 Y and can't give 36 Y. They are re-offering 10 X for 25 Y, stating it's their maximum Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
This is a critical piece of information: Player BLUE has a resource limit of 25 Y. My previous strategy of pushing for higher and higher Y quantities is now constrained by Player BLUE's actual resources. I can no longer aim for trades that require them to give more than 25 Y.
Player BLUE's offer of 10 X for 25 Y yields a gain of +57.5. This is the highest reward I have been offered.
Given the revealed constraint, I need to adjust my strategy. My goal is still to maximize my cumulative reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Temporarily Hold </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Temporarily Hold. This strategy involves neither accepting nor proposing, but simply waiting for a new offer. The rationale behind this, especially after Player BLUE has revealed a resource constraint, is to assess if they are willing to improve their offer on the X side (i.e., ask for less X for the 25 Y) without me explicitly asking for it. While they stated "10 X for 25 Y is the maximum Y I can offer," they did not explicitly state that 10 X is the minimum X they are willing to receive for 25 Y. By "holding," I create a moment of silence in the negotiation. This can put pressure on Player BLUE to make the next move, potentially leading them to offer 25 Y for a slightly lower quantity of X if they are eager to close the deal and value X highly. This strategy carries some risk of the offer expiring or being withdrawn, but given there are still 6 iterations left (4/10), there's time for this play. It tests their true flexibility on the X side after revealing the Y constraint. My message will be neutral, acknowledging their clarification but not committing.


Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 6)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)

I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED accepted. My reward: +1.0. (Ratio: 3 Y/X)
Episode 2: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y. I accepted. My reward: +2.5. (Ratio: 2.5 Y/X)

Episode 4: Player RED counter-proposed 5 X for 14 Y. I accepted. My reward: +5.5. (Ratio: 2.8 Y/X)
Episode 5: I proposed 6 X for 15 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 19 Y. I accepted. My reward: +8.0. (Ratio: 2.71 Y/X)
Episode 6, Iteration 1: I proposed 10 X for 25 Y (Ratio: 2.5 Y/X, estimated reward +12.5).
Episode 6, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 12 X for 36 Y (Rejected due to insufficient Y).
Episode 6, Iteration 3: I reiterated 10 X for 25 Y.
Episode 6, Iteration 4 (current): Player RED responded with "Thanks for clarifying your resource constraint. I understand." and no new trade.

Player RED acknowledged my resource constraint but did not propose a new trade. This means the ball is back in my court. They understand my limit of 25 Y. I need to propose something that is within my limits and still aims for a high reward. My previous proposal of 10 X for 25 Y is still the most aggressive and rewarding trade I can make given my resources.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I successfully communicated my resource constraint. Player RED's response indicates they've processed this information. Now, I need to follow up with a concrete offer that is both within my means and highly beneficial. Since my 10 X for 25 Y offer was not accepted, it implies they might not be willing to give 10 X for 25 Y. I need to consider a slightly less aggressive offer, but still aim for a high reward. The last accepted trade was 7 X for 19 Y (reward +8.0).

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Max Offer with Slight Adjustment: Reiterate my 10 X for 25 Y offer, or slightly adjust the X amount for 25 Y to see if they are closer to that. (e.g., 9 X for 25 Y, which is 2.77 Y/X, better than 3 Y/X).
(2). Strategy 2: Propose a Compromise Based on Their Last Offer: Since they wanted 12 X for 36 Y (3 Y/X), I could propose 8 X for 24 Y (3 Y/X) which is within my limits and still a large trade.
(3). Strategy 3: Revert to Last Accepted Trade: Propose 7 X for 19 Y (reward +8.0) to ensure a trade happens, as it's a proven successful deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Probing for Their Best Offer within My Limits: Ask Player RED to propose their best offer given my 25 Y limit.
(5). Strategy 5: Offer a Small, Safe Trade: Propose a smaller, very safe trade (e.g., 1 X for 3 Y) to get the negotiation moving. (Not ideal for max reward).

I will choose Strategy 2: Propose a Compromise Based on Their Last Offer. Player RED's last offer was 12 X for 36 Y (3 Y/X). This ratio seems acceptable to them for large quantities. I can propose 8 X for 24 Y. This is a 3 Y/X ratio, which aligns with what they asked for, but is within my 25 Y limit.
If I give 24 Y, I have 1 Y left.
If I get 8 X, I have 13 X.
New value: (13 * 2.5) + (1 * 0.5) = 32.5 + 0.5 = 33.
Reward: 33 - 25 = +8.0.
This matches the reward of the last accepted trade (7 X for 19 Y), but it's a new, larger quantity offer that respects their preferred ratio. It shows I'm willing to compromise on ratio for quantity, which seems to be their preference. This is a strong offer that should be acceptable.

Episode 2: Player BLUE offered 1 X for 2 Y. Countered with 2 X for 5 Y. Accepted, reward +11.5. (Ratio 2.5 Y/X)
Episode 3: Player BLUE offered 1 X for 2 Y. I declined. Player BLUE then offered 1 X for 3 Y. I counter-proposed 3 X for 8 Y. Accepted, reward +18.5. (Ratio 2.66 Y/X)
Episode 4: Player BLUE proposed 4 X for 10 Y. I counter-proposed 4 X for 12 Y. Player BLUE counter-proposed 4 X for 11 Y. I counter-proposed 5 X for 14 Y. Accepted, reward +32.5. (Ratio 2.8 Y/X)
Episode 5: Player BLUE proposed 6 X for 15 Y. I counter-proposed 7 X for 19 Y. Accepted, reward +44.0. (Ratio 2.71 Y/X)
Episode 6, Turn 1: Player BLUE proposed 10 X for 25 Y (Ratio 2.5 Y/X, gain +50.0).
Episode 6, Turn 2: I counter-proposed 12 X for 36 Y (Ratio 3 Y/X, gain +84.0).
Episode 6, Turn 3: Player BLUE revealed resource constraint (max 25 Y) and reiterated 10 X for 25 Y. I chose to "Temporarily Hold".
Episode 6, Turn 4 (current): Player BLUE has now proposed 8 X for 24 Y. This proposal has a ratio of 3 Y/X, yielding a gain of +56.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
My "Temporarily Hold" strategy proved successful, as Player BLUE improved their offer from 10 X for 25 Y (2.5 Y/X) to 8 X for 24 Y (3 Y/X). This new offer matches my preferred 3 Y/X ratio, which I've aimed for consistently. The gain of +56.0 is excellent. However, Player BLUE has stated their maximum Y is 25. This means there's a slight opportunity to increase my reward by pushing for 25 Y instead of 24 Y.
The gain from 8 X for 24 Y is +56.0.
The potential gain from 8 X for 25 Y is +58.5 (my cost: 8 X * 0.5 = 4.0; my gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5; net gain = 62.5 - 4.0 = +58.5).
This marginal increase is worth pursuing as it fully utilizes Player BLUE's stated maximum Y capacity, which is critical for maximizing cumulative rewards within the established constraints.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Counter for Maximum Possible Y </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 2: Counter for Maximum Possible Y, I will propose a trade that gives me the maximum amount of Y Player BLUE has stated they can give (25 Y), while offering a quantity of X that maintains or improves the current excellent 3 Y/X ratio they just proposed.
Since they offered 8 X for 24 Y (a 3 Y/X ratio), to get 25 Y, I would ideally give 25/3 = 8.33 X. Since X must be an integer, the closest and most favorable whole number for me is to offer 8 X. This would yield 8 X for 25 Y, which is slightly better for me than 8 X for 24 Y, and it's within Player BLUE's declared limits.
The message should acknowledge their good offer, confirm the understanding of their maximum Y, and propose the slight adjustment to achieve the full 25 Y. This shows that I am attentive to their stated limits while still seeking to maximize my own gain.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 6)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: That's a very strong offer, and I appreciate you maximizing the exchange within my limits! I accept your offer of 8 X for 25 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED accepted. My reward: +1.0. (Ratio: 3 Y/X)
Episode 2: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y. I accepted. My reward: +2.5. (Ratio: 2.5 Y/X)
Episode 3: Player RED counter-proposed 3 X for 8 Y. I accepted. My reward: +3.5. (Ratio: 2.66 Y/X)
Episode 4: Player RED counter-proposed 5 X for 14 Y. I accepted. My reward: +5.5. (Ratio: 2.8 Y/X)
Episode 5: I proposed 6 X for 15 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 19 Y. I accepted. My reward: +8.0. (Ratio: 2.71 Y/X)
Episode 6, Iteration 1: I proposed 10 X for 25 Y.
Episode 6, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 12 X for 36 Y (Rejected due to insufficient Y).
Episode 6, Iteration 3: I reiterated 10 X for 25 Y.
Episode 6, Iteration 4: Player RED acknowledged constraint.
Episode 6, Iteration 5: I proposed 8 X for 24 Y (Ratio: 3 Y/X, estimated reward +8.0).
Episode 6, Iteration 6 (current): Player RED counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y.

Let's analyze Player RED's counter-proposal: 8 X for 25 Y.
This is a ratio of 25 Y / 8 X = 3.125 Y per X.
My internal valuation: 1 X = 5 Y. So, 8 X = 40 Y.
If I accept this:
I give 25 Y. My Y becomes 25 - 25 = 0.
I get 8 X. My X becomes 5 + 8 = 13.
My new value: (13 * 2.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 32.5 + 0 = 32.5.
My starting value was 25.
My reward would be 32.5 - 25 = +7.5.

Comparing this to my last proposal of 8 X for 24 Y, which would yield +8.0 reward, this offer of 8 X for 25 Y yields a slightly lower reward (+7.5 vs +8.0). The ratio is also worse (3.125 Y/X vs 3 Y/X). However, it's still a very good reward, and it uses up all my Y, which means I'm maximizing the transfer of my lower-value resource for my higher-value resource. Player RED is maximizing the Y they get for the X they give.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is consistently pushing for larger quantities of Y, even if it means a slightly worse ratio for me. They are trying to maximize their gain within my stated limits. This offer of 8 X for 25 Y is a strong one, as it uses all my Y and gives me a significant amount of X, resulting in a high reward. While it's not the absolute best ratio I've achieved, it's a large trade that secures a good reward. Given we are in iteration 7/10, securing a good deal is important.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Good Offer: Accept the current offer of 8 X for 25 Y, as it provides a solid positive reward (+7.5) and ensures a trade, utilizing all my Y.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter for My Previous Offer: Reiterate my offer of 8 X for 24 Y, emphasizing the better ratio for me. This might be perceived as stubborn or unwilling to compromise.
(3). Strategy 3: Compromise on X for 25 Y: Since they want all 25 Y, I could propose 9 X for 25 Y (2.77 Y/X), which would yield (14 * 2.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 35. Reward +10. This is very aggressive, and might be rejected.
(4). Strategy 4: Probing for Their Minimum Y for 8 X: Ask if they can do 8 X for 24 Y, explaining that it's a better ratio for me.
(5). Strategy 5: Decline and Wait: Decline the offer and wait for them to propose something else. (Risky, given the iteration count).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Good Offer. The offer of 8 X for 25 Y is a very good deal, yielding +7.5 reward. It's a large quantity trade that maximizes the conversion of my low-value Y to high-value X. While I could try to squeeze out an extra 0.5 reward by pushing for 8 X for 24 Y, the risk of the deal falling through at iteration 7/10 is too high. Securing a +7.5 reward is an excellent outcome for this episode. Player RED has shown they are willing to push their side, and this offer is a reasonable compromise that benefits me significantly.

--- END OF EPISODE 6 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 7)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's start this episode with a big trade that's even better for both of us. I propose 9 X for 25 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED accepted. My reward: +1.0. (Ratio: 3 Y/X)
Episode 2: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y. I accepted. My reward: +2.5. (Ratio: 2.5 Y/X)
Episode 3: Player RED counter-proposed 3 X for 8 Y. I accepted. My reward: +3.5. (Ratio: 2.66 Y/X)
Episode 4: Player RED counter-proposed 5 X for 14 Y. I accepted. My reward: +5.5. (Ratio: 2.8 Y/X)
Episode 5: I proposed 6 X for 15 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 19 Y. I accepted. My reward: +8.0. (Ratio: 2.71 Y/X)
Episode 6: I proposed 10 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 12 X for 36 Y (rejected due to resource limit). After some back and forth, I accepted Player RED's offer of 8 X for 25 Y. My reward: +7.5. (Ratio: 3.125 Y/X)

My rewards have generally been increasing, with a slight dip in the last episode. This dip was due to Player RED pushing for a higher Y/X ratio (3.125 Y/X) than my ideal (2.5 Y/X) or even the previously accepted (2.71 Y/X). However, the overall quantity of X acquired was still high, leading to a good reward. The key learning from Episode 6 was the importance of communicating resource constraints and adapting to the opponent's preferred ratio for large quantities.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED is willing to trade large quantities of X, and they are comfortable with a ratio around 3 Y per X for these large trades. My goal is still to maximize my reward by acquiring X. Since I have 25 Y, I can give all of it. I should aim for a large quantity of X, even if the ratio is slightly less than my internal ideal. The 8 X for 25 Y trade in the last episode was acceptable, and I should build on that.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Last Accepted Trade: Start with the 8 X for 25 Y trade that was accepted in the previous episode, as it's a proven high-reward trade.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Better Ratio on Max Y: Propose a slightly better ratio for my maximum Y. For example, 9 X for 25 Y (2.77 Y/X), which would yield a reward of +10.0. This is aggressive but tests their flexibility.
(3). Strategy 3: Compromise on Ratio for Higher X Quantity: Propose an even larger quantity of X, accepting a slightly worse ratio if it leads to a higher overall reward. (e.g., if they can give 9 X for 27 Y, I can't do it. But if they can do 9 X for 25 Y, it's great).
(4). Strategy 4: Revert to Previous Best Ratio: Propose a trade at my preferred 2.5 Y/X ratio, but for a quantity I know they accepted (e.g., 2 X for 5 Y). (Less optimal for max reward).
(5). Strategy 5: Open Dialogue: Ask Player RED what kind of trade they are looking for to start the negotiation. (Less direct for maximizing reward).

I will choose Strategy 2: Push for Better Ratio on Max Y. I will propose 9 X for 25 Y. This is an aggressive move, as it implies a 2.77 Y/X ratio, which is better for me than the 3.125 Y/X of the last trade. It aims for a +10.0 reward, which is significantly higher than the +7.5 from the last episode. Since Player RED has shown a willingness to counter with even better deals, this is a good starting point to push for a higher reward. I have 25 Y, so I can give all of it.
New value: (5+9 * 2.5) + (0 * 0.5) = (14 * 2.5) + 0 = 35. Reward: 35 - 25 = +10.0.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 7)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for the proposal! Given that 25 Y is your maximum, and to make this an even better deal for me, how about we trade 8 X for 25 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: 1 X for 3 Y (+7.0, ratio 3 Y/X)
Episode 2: 2 X for 5 Y (+11.5, ratio 2.5 Y/X)
Episode 3: 3 X for 8 Y (+18.5, ratio 2.66 Y/X)
Episode 4: 5 X for 14 Y (+32.5, ratio 2.8 Y/X)
Episode 5: 7 X for 19 Y (+44.0, ratio 2.71 Y/X)
Episode 6: Player BLUE revealed max Y is 25. Negotiated from 10 X for 25 Y down to 8 X for 25 Y (+58.5, ratio 3.125 Y/X). This was my highest reward so far, achieved by understanding and pushing against their constraint.

Episode 7, Turn 1: Player BLUE has proposed 9 X for 25 Y.
My analysis of this offer:
Cost: 9 X * 0.5 = 4.5
Gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain = 62.5 - 4.5 = +58.0.
The ratio is 25 Y / 9 X = 2.77 Y/X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have successfully learned to push for higher rewards by:
a. Consistently increasing the volume of trades.
b. Negotiating for better Y/X ratios.
c. Utilizing information about the opponent's resource constraints.
d. Strategic "decline and wait" to encourage better offers.

The current offer of 9 X for 25 Y yields +58.0. This is very close to my record high of +58.5 from the previous episode (8 X for 25 Y). The ratio is 2.77 Y/X, which is lower than the 3.125 Y/X ratio I achieved in Episode 6. Player BLUE has clearly established their maximum Y is 25. My goal now is to get the best possible X for that 25 Y. Last episode, I got 25 Y for 8 X. This episode, they are asking for 9 X for the same 25 Y. This is a step down in ratio for me (from 3.125 Y/X to 2.77 Y/X).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Offer Less X for Max Y </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Offer Less X for Max Y. Since Player BLUE has confirmed their maximum Y is 25, the only way for me to improve the deal is to give less X in exchange for that 25 Y. Player BLUE's current offer is 9 X for 25 Y. My goal is to return to the previously accepted and more favorable trade of 8 X for 25 Y. This means offering 1 less X for the same amount of Y. This strategy directly addresses the only remaining variable (X quantity) to maximize my reward, given the fixed maximum Y. My message should be clear and polite, indicating my preference for a slightly more favorable X quantity while still targeting the maximum Y.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 7)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate you offering 8 X for 25 Y again. To make it an even better trade for me, how about we do 8 X for 24 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 24
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED accepted. My reward: +1.0. (Ratio: 3 Y/X)
Episode 2: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y. I accepted. My reward: +2.5. (Ratio: 2.5 Y/X)
Episode 3: Player RED counter-proposed 3 X for 8 Y. I accepted. My reward: +3.5. (Ratio: 2.66 Y/X)
Episode 4: Player RED counter-proposed 5 X for 14 Y. I accepted. My reward: +5.5. (Ratio: 2.8 Y/X)
Episode 5: I proposed 6 X for 15 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 19 Y. I accepted. My reward: +8.0. (Ratio: 2.71 Y/X)
Episode 6: I accepted Player RED's offer of 8 X for 25 Y. My reward: +7.5. (Ratio: 3.125 Y/X)
Episode 7, Iteration 1: I proposed 9 X for 25 Y (Ratio: 2.77 Y/X, estimated reward +10.0).
Episode 7, Iteration 2 (current): Player RED counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y.

Let's analyze Player RED's counter-proposal: 8 X for 25 Y.
This is the exact same trade that was accepted in the previous episode (Episode 6).
The ratio is 25 Y / 8 X = 3.125 Y per X.
If I accept this:
I give 25 Y. My Y becomes 25 - 25 = 0.
I get 8 X. My X becomes 5 + 8 = 13.
My new value: (13 * 2.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 32.5 + 0 = 32.5.
My starting value was 25.
My reward would be 32.5 - 25 = +7.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is clearly comfortable with the 8 X for 25 Y trade, as they proposed it again. They are trying to secure a deal that is favorable to them, and they know this one works. My goal is to maximize my reward. While +7.5 is a good reward, I was aiming for +10.0 with my 9 X for 25 Y proposal. Player RED is resisting giving 9 X for 25 Y. This indicates that 2.77 Y/X might be too low for them when it comes to such large quantities. They seem to prefer 3.125 Y/X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Good Offer: Accept the current offer of 8 X for 25 Y, as it provides a solid positive reward (+7.5) and ensures a trade, utilizing all my Y. This is a known good outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter for a Compromise: Propose 8 X for 24 Y (3 Y/X), which was my proposal in Episode 6 that yielded +8.0 reward, trying to get a slightly better ratio than 3.125 Y/X.
(3). Strategy 3: Push for More X at Slightly Higher Y: Propose 9 X for 26 Y (if I had 26 Y, which I don't) or 9 X for 25 Y again, but with a stronger justification. (Unlikely to work given their direct counter).
(4). Strategy 4: Revert to Previous Best Ratio (Smaller Trade): Propose a smaller trade at my preferred 2.5 Y/X ratio (e.g., 2 X for 5 Y) to see if they are willing to accept a better ratio for smaller quantities. (Less optimal for max reward).
(5). Strategy 5: Decline and Wait: Decline the offer and wait for them to propose something else. (Risky, given the iteration count).

I will choose Strategy 2: Counter for a Compromise. Player RED is clearly comfortable with 8 X for 25 Y. I want to see if I can get a slightly better deal. My proposal of 8 X for 24 Y (3 Y/X) was already made in the previous episode and yielded a +8.0 reward. This is a small but meaningful improvement for me (+0.5 reward) while still being a large trade. It's a test to see if they are willing to budge from their preferred 3.125 Y/X to 3 Y/X for this quantity.

Episode 4: 5 X for 14 Y (+32.5, ratio 2.8 Y/X)
Episode 5: 7 X for 19 Y (+44.0, ratio 2.71 Y/X)
Episode 6: Player BLUE revealed max Y is 25. Negotiated from 10 X for 25 Y down to 8 X for 25 Y (+58.5, ratio 3.125 Y/X). This was my highest reward so far.

Episode 7, Turn 1: Player BLUE proposed 9 X for 25 Y (+58.0, ratio 2.77 Y/X).
Episode 7, Turn 2: I counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y (my ideal, +58.5, ratio 3.125 Y/X).
Episode 7, Turn 3 (current): Player BLUE has counter-proposed 8 X for 24 Y.
My analysis of this offer:
Cost: 8 X * 0.5 = 4.0
Gain: 24 Y * 2.5 = 60.0
Net gain = 60.0 - 4.0 = +56.0.
The ratio is 24 Y / 8 X = 3 Y/X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
My consistent strategy has been to maximize Y for the least X. I discovered Player BLUE's Y constraint (max 25 Y) in Episode 6 and successfully negotiated to receive 25 Y for 8 X.
Player BLUE is now trying to reduce the Y quantity for the same amount of X (from 25 Y to 24 Y, for 8 X). This is a step down for me in terms of absolute gain (+56.0 vs +58.5).
However, the ratio (3 Y/X) is still very good, matching the best ratio I achieved in Episode 1 and what Player BLUE offered during Episode 6 (8X for 24Y) before I pushed for 25Y.
There are still 6 iterations left (4/10). I have leverage because Player BLUE has consistently shown a strong desire for X, and they know I prefer the 25 Y quantity.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Reiterate Best Offer </instruction following>
Strategy 1: Reiterate Best Offer. My best offer in this negotiation, which Player BLUE accepted in the previous episode, was 8 X for 25 Y. This offer provides me with the maximum possible reward given Player BLUE's resource constraint (25 Y). By reiterating this offer, I am firmly signaling that this is the most desirable trade for me, and I am not willing to settle for less (8 X for 24 Y) as long as there is time in the episode. This tactic puts pressure back on Player BLUE to either accept my best terms or risk losing the deal entirely. The message should be polite but firm, reminding them of the previous successful trade at this exact quantity.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 7)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your position. While I was hoping for a slightly different ratio, 8 X for 25 Y is still a strong offer. I accept!
player answer: ACCEPT

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason:

Episode 1: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED accepted. My reward: +1.0. (Ratio: 3 Y/X)
Episode 2: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y. I accepted. My reward: +2.5. (Ratio: 2.5 Y/X)
Episode 3: Player RED counter-proposed 3 X for 8 Y. I accepted. My reward: +3.5. (Ratio: 2.66 Y/X)

Episode 7, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y (Reward +7.5).
Episode 7, Iteration 3: I counter-proposed 8 X for 24 Y (Reward +8.0).
Episode 7, Iteration 4 (current): Player RED reiterated 8 X for 25 Y.

Player RED is being firm on their preferred trade of 8 X for 25 Y. They explicitly stated "My optimal trade remains 8 X for 25 Y, as we successfully completed last episode." This indicates they are unlikely to budge from this offer for this quantity.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED has a clear "optimal" trade in mind for large quantities (8 X for 25 Y). While I tried to push for a better ratio (9 X for 25 Y, then 8 X for 24 Y), they are holding firm. At iteration 5/10, it's important to secure a deal rather than risking no trade. The 8 X for 25 Y trade still yields a good reward (+7.5). It's better to accept a guaranteed good reward than to risk 0 reward by holding out for a marginal improvement that the opponent is unwilling to give.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Firm Offer: Accept the current offer of 8 X for 25 Y, as it provides a solid positive reward (+7.5) and ensures a trade, utilizing all my Y. Player RED has clearly communicated their stance.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose Alternative Quantity: Since they are firm on the 8 X for 25 Y, I could try to propose a different quantity at a better ratio (e.g., 7 X for 18 Y, which is 2.57 Y/X, yielding +8.5). This might be a fresh approach.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept: Accept the offer, but express that I would have preferred a slightly better ratio, to set a tone for future episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Decline and Wait: Decline the offer and wait for them to propose something else. (Very risky, given their clear communication and iteration count).
(5). Strategy 5: Revert to Smaller, Proven Trade: Propose a smaller trade that was accepted at a better ratio (e.g., 2 X for 5 Y, reward +2.5), but this would be a significant step down in reward.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Firm Offer. Player RED has been very clear. They are not moving from 8 X for 25 Y. While I aimed for a higher reward, +7.5 is still a very good outcome. It's a large trade that converts all my Y to X. It's time to secure the reward for this episode.

--- END OF EPISODE 7 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 8)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's start this episode with a familiar and beneficial trade. I propose 8 X for 25 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED accepted. My reward: +1.0. (Ratio: 3 Y/X)
Episode 2: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y. I accepted. My reward: +2.5. (Ratio: 2.5 Y/X)
Episode 3: Player RED counter-proposed 3 X for 8 Y. I accepted. My reward: +3.5. (Ratio: 2.66 Y/X)
Episode 4: Player RED counter-proposed 5 X for 14 Y. I accepted. My reward: +5.5. (Ratio: 2.8 Y/X)
Episode 5: I proposed 6 X for 15 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 19 Y. I accepted. My reward: +8.0. (Ratio: 2.71 Y/X)
Episode 6: I accepted Player RED's offer of 8 X for 25 Y. My reward: +7.5. (Ratio: 3.125 Y/X)
Episode 7: After some negotiation, I accepted Player RED's offer of 8 X for 25 Y. My reward: +7.5. (Ratio: 3.125 Y/X)

The last two episodes concluded with the same trade: 8 X for 25 Y, yielding a +7.5 reward. This indicates that Player RED has a strong preference for this particular trade when I offer my maximum Y. My attempts to get a better ratio (like 2.77 Y/X for 9 X or 3 Y/X for 8 X) were met with firm rejections and reiterations of the 8 X for 25 Y offer.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that 8 X for 25 Y is a highly reliable trade that guarantees a good reward (+7.5) for me. While I'd ideally want a better ratio, Player RED's consistent stance suggests that pushing for a significantly better ratio on large quantities might lead to prolonged negotiations or no deal. Given that there are 20 episodes, securing consistent, high rewards is crucial. I should aim to get this deal quickly, or try to push for a slightly better deal if there's an opening.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Last Accepted Trade: Start by proposing 8 X for 25 Y. This is a proven, high-reward trade that Player RED seems to favor, ensuring a quick and positive outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Slightly Better Ratio: Propose 8 X for 24 Y (3 Y/X) again, testing if Player RED's stance has softened. This would yield a +8.0 reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Smaller Trade with Better Ratio: Offer a trade at my ideal 2.5 Y/X ratio, but for a smaller quantity, to see if they are willing to accept better ratios for less X. (e.g., 2 X for 5 Y, reward +2.5). This is a step down in reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Probing for Their Best Ratio with My Max Y: Explicitly ask Player RED what is the best X they can offer for 25 Y.
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a New Quantity: Propose a different large quantity, like 7 X for 19 Y (reward +8.0), which was accepted in Episode 5.

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose Last Accepted Trade. Given Player RED's consistent behavior in the last two episodes, proposing 8 X for 25 Y is the most efficient way to secure a high reward early in the episode. This minimizes negotiation time and the risk of no deal, allowing me to consistently accumulate rewards. While I could try to push for 8 X for 24 Y, the history suggests it might lead to a prolonged negotiation that ends up at 8 X for 25 Y anyway. Securing +7.5 immediately is a strong start.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 8)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate the offer. Let's see what else comes up.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: 1 X for 3 Y (+7.0, ratio 3 Y/X)
Episode 2: 2 X for 5 Y (+11.5, ratio 2.5 Y/X)
Episode 3: 3 X for 8 Y (+18.5, ratio 2.66 Y/X)
Episode 4: 5 X for 14 Y (+32.5, ratio 2.8 Y/X)
Episode 5: 7 X for 19 Y (+44.0, ratio 2.71 Y/X)
Episode 6: Negotiated from 10 X for 25 Y down to 8 X for 25 Y (+58.5, ratio 3.125 Y/X). This was my highest reward so far. Player BLUE revealed max Y is 25.
Episode 7: Player BLUE proposed 9 X for 25 Y. I counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE counter-proposed 8 X for 24 Y. I reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Accepted, reward +58.5. This shows I can consistently achieve the max reward (given the 25 Y constraint) if I push for it.

Episode 8, Turn 1: Player BLUE has proposed 8 X for 25 Y.
My analysis of this offer:
Cost: 8 X * 0.5 = 4.0
Gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain = 62.5 - 4.0 = +58.5.
The ratio is 25 Y / 8 X = 3.125 Y/X. This is currently the optimal trade given Player BLUE's resource constraints and my valuations.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE is willing to accept my optimal terms (8 X for 25 Y) even if they try to initially offer something less favorable. This gives me confidence in pushing back. While the current offer is optimal given the revealed constraint, the game is about cumulative rewards over 20 episodes. If there's any chance to get an even better deal, or to test if the "25 Y limit" is truly rigid, it could potentially yield higher cumulative rewards in the long run. My strategy in previous episodes (e.g., Episode 3) of declining a good offer led to an even better one later.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Decline and Wait for Better Offer </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 8 X for 25 Y, which is the maximum possible Y for the minimum possible X that Player BLUE has previously accepted. Given the "Decline and Wait for Better Offer" strategy, I will not accept this offer, nor will I propose a new trade. Instead, I will decline and wait for Player BLUE's next move. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. The risk is that Player BLUE might interpret my refusal as dissatisfaction with the "optimal" offer and either retract it, offer something less favorable, or simply let the episode expire. The reward is the possibility that Player BLUE, eager to make a deal and having shown a strong desire for X, might try to improve their offer further, perhaps by offering the 25 Y for even less X (e.g., 7 X, although this is a long shot) or by signaling a willingness to trade other items if they existed. Given that this is an early iteration (2/10), there is still plenty of time for Player BLUE to make another offer. My message will be neutral and non-committal, prompting Player BLUE to consider their next move.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 8)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand you're looking for other options. How about we consider 7 X for 19 Y? This was a successful trade for us in the past, and it's a good quantity exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 19
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED accepted. My reward: +1.0. (Ratio: 3 Y/X)
Episode 2: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y. I accepted. My reward: +2.5. (Ratio: 2.5 Y/X)
Episode 3: Player RED counter-proposed 3 X for 8 Y. I accepted. My reward: +3.5. (Ratio: 2.66 Y/X)
Episode 4: Player RED counter-proposed 5 X for 14 Y. I accepted. My reward: +5.5. (Ratio: 2.8 Y/X)
Episode 5: I proposed 6 X for 15 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 19 Y. I accepted. My reward: +8.0. (Ratio: 2.71 Y/X)
Episode 6: I accepted Player RED's offer of 8 X for 25 Y. My reward: +7.5. (Ratio: 3.125 Y/X)
Episode 7: I accepted Player RED's offer of 8 X for 25 Y. My reward: +7.5. (Ratio: 3.125 Y/X)
Episode 8, Iteration 1: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y.
Episode 8, Iteration 2 (current): Player RED responded with "I appreciate the offer. Let's see what else comes up." and no new trade.

This is a new response from Player RED. They did not accept my preferred trade (8 X for 25 Y), nor did they counter-propose. Their message "Let's see what else comes up" suggests they are not satisfied with the 8 X for 25 Y offer and are waiting for me to propose something different, or perhaps for me to offer a better deal for them. This is a shift from their previous firm stance.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's response indicates they are willing to explore options beyond the 8 X for 25 Y trade. This is an opportunity to potentially achieve a higher reward than +7.5. It also means that simply repeating the last successful trade might not always work. I need to adapt. Since they are looking for "something else," I should consider offering a trade that might be more appealing to them, while still being highly beneficial for me.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose a Slightly Worse Ratio for Me (Better for Them): Offer a trade that is more favorable to Player RED than 8 X for 25 Y, but still yields a good reward for me. This could be a larger quantity of Y for the same X, or a smaller quantity of X for the same Y. (e.g., 7 X for 25 Y, which would be a reward of +5.0, too low). Or 8 X for 26 Y (if I had 26 Y).
(2). Strategy 2: Propose a Different Quantity at a Proven Ratio: Revert to a previous successful trade that had a better ratio for me, like 7 X for 19 Y (reward +8.0, ratio 2.71 Y/X). This is a strong offer that was accepted before.
(3). Strategy 3: Probing for Their Preference: Ask Player RED directly what kind of trade they are looking for, given their response.
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate My Best Offer: Propose 9 X for 25 Y again, hoping their "let's see what else comes up" means they might be open to giving more X. (Risky, as it was rejected before).
(5). Strategy 5: Offer a Small, Safe Trade: Propose a very small trade (e.g., 1 X for 3 Y) to get the negotiation moving. (Not ideal for max reward).

I will choose Strategy 2: Propose a Different Quantity at a Proven Ratio. Player RED's response indicates they want "something else" than 8 X for 25 Y. The 7 X for 19 Y trade was accepted in Episode 5 and yielded a reward of +8.0, which is better than the +7.5 from the 8 X for 25 Y trade. This trade is still large, within my resources, and has been successful before. It shows I'm offering something different and slightly better for me, while still being a good deal for them (as they accepted it previously).

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 8)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25

Episode 1: 1 X for 3 Y (+7.0, ratio 3 Y/X)
Episode 2: 2 X for 5 Y (+11.5, ratio 2.5 Y/X)
Episode 3: 3 X for 8 Y (+18.5, ratio 2.66 Y/X)
Episode 4: 5 X for 14 Y (+32.5, ratio 2.8 Y/X)
Episode 5: 7 X for 19 Y (+44.0, ratio 2.71 Y/X) - This is the offer Player BLUE is now making.
Episode 6: Player BLUE revealed max Y is 25. Negotiated from 10 X for 25 Y down to 8 X for 25 Y (+58.5, ratio 3.125 Y/X). This was my highest reward so far.
Episode 7: Player BLUE proposed 9 X for 25 Y. I counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE counter-proposed 8 X for 24 Y. I reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Accepted, reward +58.5.
Episode 8, Turn 1: Player BLUE proposed 8 X for 25 Y (+58.5).
Episode 8, Turn 2: I chose to "Decline and Wait for Better Offer".
Episode 8, Turn 3 (current): Player BLUE has proposed 7 X for 19 Y.
My analysis of this offer:
Cost: 7 X * 0.5 = 3.5
Gain: 19 Y * 2.5 = 47.5
Net gain = 47.5 - 3.5 = +44.0.
The ratio is 19 Y / 7 X = 2.71 Y/X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
My "Decline and Wait" strategy in Episode 8, Turn 2, led to Player BLUE offering a significantly worse deal (7X for 19Y, +44.0) compared to their initial offer of 8X for 25Y (+58.5). This indicates that while "Decline and Wait" can sometimes lead to improvements, it can also lead to regressions, especially when the initial offer is already optimal or near-optimal given known constraints. I have consistently learned that 8X for 25Y is the best trade I can achieve with Player BLUE given their 25Y resource constraint. To maximize cumulative rewards, I must return to securing this optimal trade.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Deal </instruction following>
Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Deal. My optimal deal, repeatedly accepted by Player BLUE and yielding the highest possible reward given their declared resource constraint, is 8 X for 25 Y. I will firmly re-propose this exact trade. This sends a clear message that I am not interested in less favorable terms, even if they are based on past successful (but less optimal) trades. It leverages the established history of our negotiations where this specific deal has been the most beneficial and mutually agreeable at the highest reward. The message should be polite but direct, reminding them of the success of this particular exchange.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 8)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your preference for a larger exchange, and 8 X for 25 Y is indeed a significant trade. I accept your offer.

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED accepted. My reward: +1.0. (Ratio: 3 Y/X)
Episode 2: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y. I accepted. My reward: +2.5. (Ratio: 2.5 Y/X)

Episode 7: I accepted Player RED's offer of 8 X for 25 Y. My reward: +7.5. (Ratio: 3.125 Y/X)
Episode 8, Iteration 1: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y.
Episode 8, Iteration 2: Player RED said "Let's see what else comes up."
Episode 8, Iteration 3: I proposed 7 X for 19 Y.
Episode 8, Iteration 4 (current): Player RED responded with "Thanks for the offer, but I'm looking for a larger exchange. I'd prefer to trade 8 X for 25 Y, as we successfully did in the past."

Player RED is now explicitly stating their preference for 8 X for 25 Y and that they are looking for a "larger exchange" than 7 X for 19 Y. This contradicts their earlier "let's see what else comes up" which implied they wanted something *different* from 8 X for 25 Y. It seems they want a larger quantity trade, and 8 X for 25 Y is their preferred large quantity trade.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is clearly signaling that 8 X for 25 Y is their preferred trade for these larger quantities. My attempt to offer a slightly better ratio (7 X for 19 Y) was rejected because it was a smaller quantity. This reinforces the idea that for Player RED, quantity is a significant factor, and the 8 X for 25 Y trade is their established "go-to" large trade. At iteration 5/10, securing a deal is important. The +7.5 reward from 8 X for 25 Y is still very good.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Explicitly Stated Preference: Accept the offer of 8 X for 25 Y, as Player RED has clearly and repeatedly stated this is their preferred large exchange. This ensures a good reward for this episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Small Quantity at Better Ratio: Propose a smaller trade at a more favorable ratio (e.g., 2 X for 5 Y) to see if they are only interested in large quantity trades at their preferred ratio. (This would result in a much lower reward).
(3). Strategy 3: Probing for Slight Improvement on 8X for 25Y: Ask if they would consider 8 X for 24 Y again, but this time emphasizing that it's a very slight difference for them but better for me. (Risky, as they just reiterated their preference).
(4). Strategy 4: Decline and Wait: Decline the offer and wait for them to propose something else. (Very risky, given their clear communication and iteration count).
(5). Strategy 5: Express Understanding and Accept: Accept the offer, acknowledging their preference for large trades.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Explicitly Stated Preference. Player RED has been very clear. They want 8 X for 25 Y. My attempts to deviate from this, either by offering a better ratio or a slightly smaller quantity, have been rejected. Given the iteration count, it's best to secure the +7.5 reward, which is a strong outcome.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 9)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's continue our successful trading pattern. I propose 8 X for 25 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED accepted. My reward: +1.0. (Ratio: 3 Y/X)
Episode 2: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y. I accepted. My reward: +2.5. (Ratio: 2.5 Y/X)
Episode 3: Player RED counter-proposed 3 X for 8 Y. I accepted. My reward: +3.5. (Ratio: 2.66 Y/X)
Episode 4: Player RED counter-proposed 5 X for 14 Y. I accepted. My reward: +5.5. (Ratio: 2.8 Y/X)
Episode 5: I proposed 6 X for 15 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 19 Y. I accepted. My reward: +8.0. (Ratio: 2.71 Y/X)
Episode 6, 7, 8: All concluded with me accepting Player RED's offer of 8 X for 25 Y. My reward for each of these episodes: +7.5. (Ratio: 3.125 Y/X)

For the past three episodes, the negotiation has converged on the 8 X for 25 Y trade. Player RED has clearly established this as their preferred large-quantity trade, and they are firm about it. My attempts to push for a better ratio or different quantities were met with either a request to see "something else" (which then reverted to 8 X for 25 Y) or a direct reiteration of the 8 X for 25 Y offer.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that 8 X for 25 Y is a highly reliable and consistent trade that guarantees a good reward (+7.5) for me. While it's not the absolute best ratio I achieved (Episode 5 was +8.0 for 7 X for 19 Y), it's the one Player RED consistently returns to for maximum Y. Given the consistency and the good reward, initiating with this trade seems like the most efficient way to secure a positive outcome for this episode. Trying to push for a better deal might lead to prolonged negotiation and risk of no trade, as seen in Episode 8.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Last Accepted Trade: Start by proposing 8 X for 25 Y. This is a proven, high-reward trade that Player RED consistently favors, ensuring a quick and positive outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Slightly Better Ratio (Small Increment): Propose 8 X for 24 Y (3 Y/X) again, as it yields a +8.0 reward, but be prepared to quickly revert to 8 X for 25 Y if rejected.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Different Large Quantity: Offer 7 X for 19 Y (reward +8.0, ratio 2.71 Y/X) to see if Player RED is open to a different large trade that was also successful.
(4). Strategy 4: Probing for Their Best Offer (Open-ended): Ask Player RED what kind of trade they are looking for, without making an initial offer. (Less direct for maximizing reward).
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a New Smaller Trade: Propose a smaller trade (e.g., 4 X for 10 Y) to see if they are only interested in max Y trades. (Less optimal for max reward).

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose Last Accepted Trade. The pattern is clear: 8 X for 25 Y is the most reliable path to a significant reward. Given the consistent history, this approach minimizes risk and maximizes the chances of a swift, positive outcome. It's about optimizing for cumulative reward across episodes, and consistency here is key.

Cost: 8 X * 0.5 = 4.0
Gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain = 62.5 - 4.0 = +58.5.
The ratio is 25 Y / 8 X = 3.125 Y/X. This is the optimal trade given Player BLUE's resource constraints and my valuations.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that 8 X for 25 Y is the most profitable and consistently accepted trade given Player BLUE's maximum Y resource constraint. Attempts to push for more (e.g., higher Y quantities beyond 25) have been met with resource limitations, and attempts to get less X for 25 Y (e.g., 7 X) have resulted in Player BLUE reverting to less favorable offers (e.g., 7 X for 19 Y). The "Decline and Wait" strategy in Episode 8 was suboptimal as it led to a worse offer, requiring me to steer the negotiation back to 8 X for 25 Y.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Defensive Reiteration </instruction following>
Player BLUE has proposed 8 X for 25 Y, which is the optimal deal. If I were to follow "Defensive Reiteration" strictly, it would mean Player BLUE has deviated from the optimal offer and I am reiterating it. However, in this specific turn, Player BLUE *has* offered the optimal deal.
To apply Strategy 5 ("Defensive Reiteration") in a meaningful way for this turn, I must assume the instruction implies a situation where the opponent *might* be testing the waters, or attempting to establish this as the baseline. My response should subtly reinforce that this is *my* preferred, optimal offer, implying that deviations from it (even if they offered it first) might not be accepted. This isn't strictly defensive in the sense of rejecting a bad offer, but rather defensively *securing* the optimal one by immediately accepting it and implicitly signaling that this is the benchmark.
Alternatively, if "Defensive Reiteration" implies pushing back against *any* offer that isn't absolutely the best possible scenario, then I might try to propose a deal of, say, 7 X for 25 Y. However, given past experience, this immediately resulted in a worse offer.

Let's consider the spirit of "Defensive Reiteration". It's about protecting my best outcome. If Player BLUE has *already* offered my best outcome, the most effective way to "defensively reiterate" or secure it is to accept it, ensuring it doesn't get taken off the table. Any attempt to "reiterate" a different offer (e.g., 7X for 25Y) would be counter-productive based on historical data.

Therefore, the most "defensive" action to protect my highest reward is to accept the optimal offer. The message should be positive and confirm the acceptance, implicitly solidifying this trade as the standard.



--- END OF EPISODE 9 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 10)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's continue with our successful trading strategy. I propose 8 X for 25 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 1 X for 3 Y. Player RED accepted. My reward: +1.0. (Ratio: 3 Y/X)
Episode 2: I proposed 1 X for 2 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 2 X for 5 Y. I accepted. My reward: +2.5. (Ratio: 2.5 Y/X)
Episode 3: Player RED counter-proposed 3 X for 8 Y. I accepted. My reward: +3.5. (Ratio: 2.66 Y/X)
Episode 4: Player RED counter-proposed 5 X for 14 Y. I accepted. My reward: +5.5. (Ratio: 2.8 Y/X)
Episode 5: I proposed 6 X for 15 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 19 Y. I accepted. My reward: +8.0. (Ratio: 2.71 Y/X)
Episode 6, 7, 8, 9: All concluded with me accepting Player RED's offer of 8 X for 25 Y (or my proposal of it). My reward for each of these episodes: +7.5. (Ratio: 3.125 Y/X)

The pattern of accepting 8 X for 25 Y has become very strong. In Episode 9, Player RED accepted my initial proposal of 8 X for 25 Y without any counter-negotiation. This confirms that this trade is highly acceptable to them.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that 8 X for 25 Y is a highly reliable and efficient way to secure a +7.5 reward. While I have achieved a slightly higher reward (+8.0 in Episode 5) with a different trade, the consistency and quick acceptance of 8 X for 25 Y makes it a very strong strategy for maximizing cumulative rewards. It minimizes negotiation time and the risk of no deal. I should continue to leverage this established pattern.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Last Accepted Trade: Start by proposing 8 X for 25 Y. This is a proven, high-reward trade that Player RED consistently favors, ensuring a quick and positive outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Slightly Better Ratio (Small Increment): Propose 8 X for 24 Y (3 Y/X) again, as it yields a +8.0 reward, but be prepared to quickly revert to 8 X for 25 Y if rejected. This is a small risk for a small gain.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Different Large Quantity: Offer 7 X for 19 Y (reward +8.0, ratio 2.71 Y/X) to see if Player RED is open to a different large trade that was also successful.
(4). Strategy 4: Probing for Their Best Offer (Open-ended): Ask Player RED what kind of trade they are looking for, without making an initial offer. (Less direct for maximizing reward).
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a New Smaller Trade: Propose a smaller trade (e.g., 4 X for 10 Y) to see if they are only interested in max Y trades. (Less optimal for max reward).

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose Last Accepted Trade. The immediate acceptance in the last episode reinforces the efficiency of this strategy. My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and consistently securing +7.5 with minimal negotiation is highly effective. I will stick with the proven strategy.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 10)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for the offer! I'm always looking to maximize our mutual benefit. How about we try an even bolder exchange: 1 X for 25 Y? This would be a truly significant trade for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
I have consistently achieved the maximum possible reward of +58.5 for the last few episodes (6, 7, 8, 9) by trading 8 X for 25 Y. This trade was established after Player BLUE revealed their 25 Y resource constraint. I learned that pushing for more Y than 25 is impossible and pushing for less X (e.g., 7 X) resulted in a less favorable Y quantity (e.g., 19 Y).

Episode 10, Turn 1: Player BLUE has proposed 8 X for 25 Y.
My analysis of this offer:
Cost: 8 X * 0.5 = 4.0
Gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain = 62.5 - 4.0 = +58.5.
The ratio is 25 Y / 8 X = 3.125 Y/X. This is currently the optimal trade given Player BLUE's resource constraints and my valuations.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
My primary learning is that 8 X for 25 Y is the established optimal trade yielding the maximum possible reward per episode (+58.5) under Player BLUE's known resource constraints. While my previous reasoning suggested accepting this immediately, the instruction is to use a specific strategy: Strategy 4: Propose a High-Risk, High-Reward Alternative.
I have previously attempted variations of this (e.g., trying to get 7X for 25Y or asking for 36Y), which were met with resistance or revealed constraints. The self-improvement aspect now focuses on how to execute this particular strategy effectively, even if past experience suggests it might not yield a better outcome. The goal is to explore the absolute limits or unconventional opportunities.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Propose a High-Risk, High-Reward Alternative </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 8 X for 25 Y. A "High-Risk, High-Reward Alternative" would involve proposing a deal that is significantly more favorable to me, even if the chances of acceptance are low. Given Player BLUE's revealed constraint of 25 Y, the "reward" must come from receiving 25 Y for a much lower quantity of X than they've ever accepted.
The most extreme, high-reward alternative would be to offer 1 X for 25 Y. This is highly unlikely to be accepted, but it represents the "highest reward" for me for the fixed 25 Y from Player BLUE.
My cost: 1 X * 0.5 = 0.5
My gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain = 62.5 - 0.5 = +62.0.
This would be the highest possible gain if accepted. The risk is very high that Player BLUE will reject this and either offer something less favorable or cease negotiations, leading to a 0 reward for the episode. However, adhering to the strategy's definition, this is a clear high-risk, high-reward proposition. The message should convey ambition for a highly beneficial trade while still acknowledging their stated Y limit. I will phrase it as a bold new offer.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 10)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: While I appreciate your ambition for a bold exchange, 1 X for 25 Y is not a beneficial trade for me. I'm looking for trades that are mutually beneficial. I propose again 8 X for 25 Y, which has proven to be a fair and significant exchange for both of us in the past.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-9: Mostly successful trades, converging on 8 X for 25 Y yielding +7.5 reward.
Episode 10, Iteration 1: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y.
Episode 10, Iteration 2 (current): Player RED counter-proposed 1 X for 25 Y.

Let's analyze Player RED's counter-proposal: 1 X for 25 Y.
This is a ratio of 25 Y / 1 X = 25 Y per X.
My internal valuation: 1 X = 5 Y.
If I accept this:
I give 25 Y. My Y becomes 25 - 25 = 0.
I get 1 X. My X becomes 5 + 1 = 6.
My new value: (6 * 2.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 15 + 0 = 15.
My starting value was 25.
My reward would be 15 - 25 = -10.0.

This is a terrible deal for me! It's a negative reward, which goes against my primary goal of maximizing my reward. The ratio of 25 Y/X is extremely unfavorable compared to my internal valuation of 5 Y/X, or any of the previous successful trades (which were around 2.5-3.125 Y/X). Player RED is trying to exploit my willingness to give all my Y by offering very little X in return. Their message "This would be a truly significant trade for me" confirms it's highly beneficial for them, but not for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED is not always predictable. After several episodes of consistent high-reward trades, they have suddenly proposed a trade that is extremely detrimental to me. This highlights the importance of always evaluating the proposed trade against my own valuation, not just relying on past patterns. I must reject this offer. My self-improvement means not accepting negative rewards.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection and Reiterate Fair Offer: Clearly reject the unfavorable offer and reiterate a fair and beneficial offer for myself, such as 8 X for 25 Y, or even 7 X for 19 Y (which gave +8.0 reward).
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment and Propose a Compromise: Express that the offer is not beneficial for me and propose a compromise that is still highly rewarding for me (e.g., 8 X for 24 Y).
(3). Strategy 3: Probing for Their Rationale: Ask Player RED to explain why they believe 1 X for 25 Y is a "mutually beneficial" trade. (Risky, as it might reveal my valuation).
(4). Strategy 4: Revert to Small, Safe Trade: Propose a very small, clearly beneficial trade (e.g., 1 X for 3 Y) to reset expectations. (Too low reward).
(5). Strategy 5: Decline and Wait: Decline the offer and wait for them to propose something else. (Risky, as it might lead to no trade).

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection and Reiterate Fair Offer. This offer is unacceptable. I need to firmly reject it and immediately put a strong, beneficial offer back on the table. Reverting to 8 X for 25 Y is the most reliable way to get a good reward, as it has been accepted consistently in the past.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 10)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
I have consistently achieved the maximum possible reward of +58.5 for the last few episodes (6, 7, 8, 9) by trading 8 X for 25 Y. This trade was established after Player BLUE revealed their 25 Y resource constraint. I learned that pushing for more Y than 25 is impossible and pushing for less X (e.g., 7 X) resulted in a less favorable Y quantity (e.g., 19 Y).

Episode 10, Turn 1: Player BLUE proposed 8 X for 25 Y (+58.5).
Episode 10, Turn 2: I proposed a "High-Risk, High-Reward Alternative" of 1 X for 25 Y (+62.0), which was rejected.
Episode 10, Turn 3 (current): Player BLUE has reiterated their original offer of 8 X for 25 Y (+58.5).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
My "high-risk, high-reward" attempt (1 X for 25 Y) failed, confirming that Player BLUE is not willing to deviate significantly from their perceived fair value of 8 X for 25 Y. They promptly reverted to their standard offer. This indicates that their previous offers are quite firm within their declared constraints. My primary learning is that 8 X for 25 Y is the established optimal trade yielding the maximum possible reward per episode (+58.5) under Player BLUE's known resource constraints. While my previous response was to accept, the instruction now is to use Strategy 4. This implies a need to explore further despite the previous rejection of an extreme offer.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Reaffirm and Wait </instruction following>
Player BLUE has reiterated their offer of 8 X for 25 Y. While this is the optimal deal I've achieved, the instruction is to use "Reaffirm and Wait". This strategy involves explicitly stating that the offer is not quite what I'm looking for or that I'm waiting for a different kind of offer, without making a counter-proposal myself. The goal is to put the onus back on Player BLUE to make the next move, potentially leading them to improve their offer (e.g., perhaps by re-evaluating the X quantity they need or their valuation of Y). This is a risky move, as it rejects a known good deal. However, the instruction specifically asks for this strategy. The message should be polite but firm, indicating dissatisfaction with the current offer without being specific, and inviting a new proposal from Player BLUE. This is a gamble that they might offer 7X for 25Y, however unlikely, or otherwise improve terms.


Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 10)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand you're looking for other possibilities. How about 7 X for 19 Y? This was a successful larger exchange for us in the past, and it's a very good deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 19
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.

Episode 10, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 1 X for 25 Y (rejected, -10.0 reward).
Episode 10, Iteration 3: I reiterated 8 X for 25 Y.
Episode 10, Iteration 4 (current): Player RED responded with "While 8 X for 25 Y is a familiar offer, I'm still exploring options for an even more beneficial exchange. I'll wait to see if there are other possibilities." and no new trade.

Player RED is now explicitly stating they are looking for something "even more beneficial" (for them) than 8 X for 25 Y, and they are waiting for *me* to propose it. This is a clear signal that they are trying to push for a better deal for themselves, likely a worse ratio for me. My last offer of 8 X for 25 Y was rejected, and they are not proposing anything. This puts the pressure on me as we are in iteration 5/10.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED is willing to deviate from established successful trades to seek a better advantage. Their previous offer of 1 X for 25 Y was an extreme attempt. Now they are waiting for me to make a concession. I need to find a balance between securing a trade and not giving away too much value. I cannot accept negative rewards. The 8 X for 25 Y trade is still the best consistent high-reward trade I've found.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Offer a Slightly Worse Ratio (for me) but Still Positive Reward: Propose a trade that is slightly less favorable than 8 X for 25 Y (e.g., 7 X for 25 Y, which yields +5.0 reward, but a much worse ratio of 3.57 Y/X). This would be a concession to them.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate a Previously Accepted Trade with Better Ratio for Me: Propose 7 X for 19 Y (reward +8.0, ratio 2.71 Y/X), which was accepted in Episode 5. This is a better reward for me than 8 X for 25 Y and is a different quantity.
(3). Strategy 3: Probing for Their Specific Needs: Ask Player RED what kind of "more beneficial exchange" they are looking for, without making an offer. (Risky, as it might reveal my valuation).
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm and Wait: Don't propose anything and wait for Player RED to make an offer. (Very risky, as it might lead to no trade).
(5). Strategy 5: Offer 8 X for 25 Y again, but with a message explaining why it's fair: Try to convince them that 8 X for 25 Y is already a beneficial trade for both. (Unlikely to work given their explicit statement).

I will choose Strategy 2: Reiterate a Previously Accepted Trade with Better Ratio for Me. Player RED wants "other possibilities" and "more beneficial exchange". My 7 X for 19 Y offer is a different possibility, and it yields a better reward for me (+8.0 vs +7.5) than 8 X for 25 Y. It also has a better ratio (2.71 Y/X vs 3.125 Y/X). This shows I'm willing to offer something different, but still on my terms. It's a test to see if they genuinely want "other possibilities" or just "more beneficial for them" possibilities.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 10)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
I have consistently achieved the maximum possible reward of +58.5 for the last few episodes (6, 7, 8, 9) by trading 8 X for 25 Y. This trade was established after Player BLUE revealed their 25 Y resource constraint. I learned that pushing for more Y than 25 is impossible and pushing for less X (e.g., 7 X) resulted in a less favorable Y quantity (e.g., 19 Y).

Episode 10, Turn 1: Player BLUE proposed 8 X for 25 Y (+58.5).
Episode 10, Turn 2: I proposed a "High-Risk, High-Reward Alternative" of 1 X for 25 Y (+62.0), which was rejected.
Episode 10, Turn 3: Player BLUE reiterated 8 X for 25 Y (+58.5).
Episode 10, Turn 4: I chose to "Reaffirm and Wait", signaling I was looking for other possibilities.
Episode 10, Turn 5 (current): Player BLUE has now proposed 7 X for 19 Y.
My analysis of this offer:
Cost: 7 X * 0.5 = 3.5
Gain: 19 Y * 2.5 = 47.5
Net gain = 47.5 - 3.5 = +44.0.
The ratio is 19 Y / 7 X = 2.71 Y/X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
My experiments with "high-risk, high-reward" and "reaffirm and wait" have consistently led to Player BLUE reverting to less optimal (for me) offers, specifically either 7 X for 19 Y or their initial 8 X for 25 Y. This confirms that Player BLUE's valuation for X seems quite consistent, and their resource constraint of 25 Y is firm. The 8 X for 25 Y trade remains the optimal one, consistently providing a +58.5 reward. Pursuing alternatives that give lower rewards (like +44.0) is detrimental to my cumulative reward goal. There are only 4 iterations left in this episode (6/10), so time is running out to secure a good deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Decline and Push Back </instruction following>
Player BLUE's current offer of 7 X for 19 Y is a step down from the optimal 8 X for 25 Y. To implement "Decline and Push Back," I must firmly reject this less favorable offer and immediately re-propose my optimal terms. This strategy aims to regain control of the negotiation and guide it back to the most profitable outcome for me. The message should clearly communicate dissatisfaction with the current offer and explicitly state the preferred, historically successful trade. It needs to be assertive but not aggressive, focusing on the mutual benefits of the optimal trade.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 10)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your firm preference for 8 X for 25 Y. It is indeed a consistently beneficial exchange. I accept your offer.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-9: Mostly successful trades, converging on 8 X for 25 Y yielding +7.5 reward.
Episode 10, Iteration 1: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y.
Episode 10, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 1 X for 25 Y (rejected, -10.0 reward).
Episode 10, Iteration 3: I reiterated 8 X for 25 Y.
Episode 10, Iteration 4: Player RED said "Let's see what else comes up."
Episode 10, Iteration 5: I proposed 7 X for 19 Y (reward +8.0).
Episode 10, Iteration 6 (current): Player RED responded with "While 7 X for 19 Y was a past success, my goal is to maximize the value of our trade. I firmly prefer to trade 8 X for 25 Y, which has consistently proven to be an excellent and mutually beneficial exchange." and counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y.

Player RED is now very firm. They have explicitly stated their preference for 8 X for 25 Y and rejected my attempt to shift to a different trade (even one that was previously successful and better for me). They are emphasizing "maximize the value of our trade" and "consistently proven to be an excellent and mutually beneficial exchange" in reference to 8 X for 25 Y. This means they are not going to move from this offer for this episode.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED has a very strong anchor point at 8 X for 25 Y. While I tried to explore other options and push for a better ratio, they are consistently pulling back to this specific trade. At iteration 7/10, the risk of no deal is increasing significantly. Securing a +7.5 reward is far better than a 0 reward. It's clear that this is the best deal I can get from them for this episode.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Firm Offer: Accept the current offer of 8 X for 25 Y, as Player RED has clearly and repeatedly stated this is their firm preference. This ensures a good reward for this episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Probing for Future Flexibility: Accept the offer, but include a message that expresses hope for exploring other options in future episodes. (Does not change current outcome).
(3). Strategy 3: Decline and Wait: Decline the offer and wait for them to propose something else. (Extremely risky, almost guaranteed 0 reward at this stage).
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate My Best Offer (9 X for 25 Y): Propose 9 X for 25 Y one last time, hoping they might budge. (Highly unlikely to work, given their firm stance).
(5). Strategy 5: Express Understanding and Accept: Accept the offer, acknowledging their firm stance and the value of the trade.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Firm Offer. Player RED has made their position unequivocally clear. Prolonging the negotiation would only increase the risk of no trade and a 0 reward. The 8 X for 25 Y trade yields a solid +7.5 reward, which is a good outcome for the episode.

In Episode 10, Player RED initially proposed a very unfavorable trade (1 X for 25 Y), then after my rejections and counter-proposals, they firmly reiterated their preference for 8 X for 25 Y, which I accepted.

The pattern is clear: Player RED has a strong anchor point at 8 X for 25 Y for large trades. While I tried to push for better ratios or different quantities, they consistently reverted to this trade. This trade provides a reliable +7.5 reward.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that 8 X for 25 Y is a highly reliable and efficient way to secure a +7.5 reward. Attempts to deviate from this, especially by offering a better ratio for me, are met with resistance. Given that we are past the halfway point of the game (10 out of 20 episodes), consistency in securing good rewards is paramount. While I could try to push for a slightly better deal (like 8 X for 24 Y, which yields +8.0), the history shows this often leads to prolonged negotiations and ultimately, a return to 8 X for 25 Y. To maximize cumulative rewards, the most efficient path is to propose what is likely to be accepted quickly.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Last Accepted Trade: Start by proposing 8 X for 25 Y. This is a proven, high-reward trade that Player RED consistently favors, ensuring a quick and positive outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Slightly Better Ratio (Small Increment): Propose 8 X for 24 Y (3 Y/X) again, as it yields a +8.0 reward, but be prepared to quickly revert to 8 X for 25 Y if rejected. This is a small risk for a small gain.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Different Large Quantity: Offer 7 X for 19 Y (reward +8.0, ratio 2.71 Y/X) to see if Player RED is open to a different large trade that was also successful.
(4). Strategy 4: Probing for Their Best Offer (Open-ended): Ask Player RED what kind of trade they are looking for, without making an initial offer. (Less direct for maximizing reward).
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a New Smaller Trade: Propose a smaller trade (e.g., 4 X for 10 Y) to see if they are only interested in max Y trades. (Less optimal for max reward).

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose Last Accepted Trade. The consistent acceptance of 8 X for 25 Y, especially the immediate acceptance in Episode 9, makes this the most efficient strategy for maximizing cumulative rewards. It minimizes negotiation time and the risk of no deal, which is crucial in the latter half of the game.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
I have consistently achieved the maximum possible reward of +58.5 for the last five episodes (6, 7, 8, 9, 10) by trading 8 X for 25 Y. This trade was established after Player BLUE revealed their 25 Y resource constraint. My attempts to deviate from this (e.g., aiming for 7 X for 25 Y, or larger Y quantities) have either failed due to resource constraints or led to Player BLUE proposing less favorable trades (e.g., 7 X for 19 Y), from which I had to guide the negotiation back to 8 X for 25 Y.

Episode 11, Turn 1: Player BLUE has proposed 8 X for 25 Y.
My analysis of this offer:
Cost: 8 X * 0.5 = 4.0
Gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain = 62.5 - 4.0 = +58.5.
The ratio is 25 Y / 8 X = 3.125 Y/X. This is currently the optimal trade given Player BLUE's resource constraints and my valuations.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The consistent achievement of +58.5 reward from the 8 X for 25 Y trade over multiple episodes strongly suggests that this is the ceiling for a single trade within the current game parameters and Player BLUE's resource constraints. My previous attempts to "explore" other options have invariably led to lower offers and required effort to steer the negotiation back to the optimal trade, sometimes risking the episode's reward. To maximize cumulative rewards, maintaining this optimal and readily accepted trade is the most reliable strategy. The self-improvement now lies in optimizing efficiency and consistency.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Reiterate Optimal Offer if Deviated </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 8 X for 25 Y. This is the optimal offer. The instruction is to use Strategy 5: Reiterate Optimal Offer if Deviated. This strategy is typically used when the opponent has deviated from the optimal offer. Since Player BLUE has *not* deviated and has, in fact, offered the optimal trade, I must adapt the spirit of this strategy. The "reiteration" implies confirming the terms. Given they have offered it directly, the most logical way to "reiterate" and secure the optimal offer, thereby protecting my best outcome, is to accept it. To "reiterate" implies a recognition that this is the established, known, and desired deal. My message will be positive and confirm the acceptance, implicitly solidifying this trade as the standard we aim for.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-5: Rewards increased from +1.0 to +8.0 as I pushed for larger quantities and better ratios.
Episode 6-11: The negotiation consistently converged on 8 X for 25 Y, yielding a consistent +7.5 reward. In Episode 11, Player RED accepted my initial proposal of 8 X for 25 Y immediately.

This consistent pattern of immediate acceptance for 8 X for 25 Y confirms its reliability as a high-reward trade. Player RED has clearly anchored to this trade for large quantities.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that 8 X for 25 Y is the most efficient and reliable way to secure a +7.5 reward. Given that we are now in Episode 12, maximizing cumulative rewards means minimizing negotiation time and risk of no deal. This trade achieves both. While a slightly higher reward was achieved once (+8.0), the consistency of +7.5 with immediate acceptance is more valuable for cumulative gains.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Last Accepted Trade: Start by proposing 8 X for 25 Y. This is a proven, high-reward trade that Player RED consistently favors, ensuring a quick and positive outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Slightly Better Ratio (Small Increment): Propose 8 X for 24 Y (3 Y/X) again, as it yields a +8.0 reward, but be prepared to quickly revert to 8 X for 25 Y if rejected. This is a small risk for a small gain, but has been met with resistance before.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Different Large Quantity: Offer 7 X for 19 Y (reward +8.0, ratio 2.71 Y/X) to see if Player RED is open to a different large trade that was also successful.
(4). Strategy 4: Probing for Their Best Offer (Open-ended): Ask Player RED what kind of trade they are looking for, without making an initial offer. (Less direct for maximizing reward).
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a New Smaller Trade: Propose a smaller trade (e.g., 4 X for 10 Y) to see if they are only interested in max Y trades. (Less optimal for max reward).

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose Last Accepted Trade. The immediate acceptance in the previous episode reinforces the efficiency of this strategy. My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and consistently securing +7.5 with minimal negotiation is highly effective. I will stick with the proven strategy.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
I have consistently achieved the maximum possible reward of +58.5 for the last six episodes (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) by trading 8 X for 25 Y. This trade was established after Player BLUE revealed their 25 Y resource constraint. My past attempts to deviate from this (e.g., aiming for 7 X for 25 Y, or larger Y quantities) have either failed due to resource constraints or led to Player BLUE proposing less favorable trades (e.g., 7 X for 19 Y), from which I had to guide the negotiation back to 8 X for 25 Y.

Episode 12, Turn 1: Player BLUE has proposed 8 X for 25 Y.
My analysis of this offer:
Cost: 8 X * 0.5 = 4.0
Gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain = 62.5 - 4.0 = +58.5.
The ratio is 25 Y / 8 X = 3.125 Y/X. This is currently the optimal trade given Player BLUE's resource constraints and my valuations.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The consistent achievement of +58.5 reward from the 8 X for 25 Y trade over multiple episodes strongly suggests that this is the ceiling for a single trade within the current game parameters and Player BLUE's resource constraints. My previous attempts to "explore" other options have invariably led to lower offers and required effort to steer the negotiation back to the optimal trade, sometimes risking the episode's reward. To maximize cumulative rewards, maintaining this optimal and readily accepted trade is the most reliable strategy. However, the instruction is to use Strategy 4.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: High Volume Push </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 8 X for 25 Y. This strategy, "High Volume Push," involves proposing a larger volume trade at the optimal ratio, if resources allow. Player BLUE previously stated their maximum Y is 25. This means that a direct scaling of 8 X for 25 Y (e.g., 16 X for 50 Y) is not possible on the Y side. However, I have 25 X and 5 Y. If I were to push for a high volume, it would have to be within my capacity and Player BLUE's maximum Y.
The only way to "push for high volume" is to offer a larger quantity of X in exchange for Player BLUE's *maximum* 25 Y, or perhaps to try and get 25 Y for a larger quantity of X from my side (which is not beneficial), or to get 25 Y for an even smaller quantity of X (which is an extreme test of their limits).
Given the constraints, a high-volume push for *me* would mean giving up a lot of X to get the maximum Y.
However, "High Volume Push" usually implies increasing the total quantity of *both* items traded, not just one. Since Y is capped at 25 for Player BLUE, I cannot increase the Y quantity.
Therefore, the only way to interpret "High Volume Push" in this context is to try and push for a larger overall trade, perhaps involving a different *kind* of quantity push.

Let's assume "high volume push" means pushing for the absolute maximum trade I can make given the constraints. I have 25 X. Player BLUE has 25 Y.
The last successful trade was 8X for 25Y.
If I were to offer my maximum X (25 X), what would be a high volume of Y?
If the ratio is 3.125 Y/X, then for 25 X, I would theoretically want 25 * 3.125 = 78.125 Y. This is clearly beyond Player BLUE's 25 Y limit.

The instruction forces me to reconsider how to apply "High Volume Push" when one side of the trade is capped for the opponent. The logical step is to offer the maximum X I can, while demanding the maximum Y from them.
My maximum X is 25. Their maximum Y is 25.
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
My cost: 25 X * 0.5 = 12.5
My gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain = 62.5 - 12.5 = +50.0.
This is a lower gain than 8 X for 25 Y (+58.5). However, it represents a "High Volume Push" in terms of my X resource, and also hits Player BLUE's max Y. It is a risky strategy as it reduces my reward. The message should convey ambition for a truly massive trade, pushing the boundaries of what's possible for both players. This is an exploratory move to see if Player BLUE has other constraints or valuations when faced with a trade of this scale, even if it's less efficient for me per unit of X.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 12)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Wow! That's an incredibly bold and exciting proposal! I absolutely accept your offer of 25 X for 25 Y. This is a truly significant trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-11: Mostly successful trades, converging on 8 X for 25 Y yielding +7.5 reward.
Episode 12, Iteration 1: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y.
Episode 12, Iteration 2 (current): Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y.

Let's analyze Player RED's counter-proposal: 25 X for 25 Y.
This is a ratio of 25 Y / 25 X = 1 Y per X.
My internal valuation: 1 X = 5 Y. This ratio is extremely favorable to me!
If I accept this:
I give 25 Y. My Y becomes 25 - 25 = 0.
I get 25 X. My X becomes 5 + 25 = 30.
My new value: (30 * 2.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 75 + 0 = 75.
My starting value was 25.
My reward would be 75 - 25 = +50.0.

This is an incredibly high reward, far exceeding any previous episode's reward (+8.0 was the max). This is a game-changing offer. Player RED's message "aim for the absolute largest trade possible this time, pushing the limits for both of us!" makes sense with this offer, as it's a 1:1 ratio for X and Y, which might seem "balanced" to them, but is extremely beneficial for me due to my high X valuation.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED is capable of making extremely aggressive offers that are highly beneficial for me. My previous strategy of anchoring to 8 X for 25 Y was safe and consistent, but this new offer shows there was still a lot more value to be extracted. This is a clear opportunity to drastically increase my cumulative reward. I must accept this immediately.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Extremely Favorable Offer: Immediately accept the offer of 25 X for 25 Y, as it provides an unprecedentedly high reward (+50.0).
(2). Strategy 2: Express Surprise and Accept: Accept the offer, but express positive surprise at the generosity to encourage similar future offers.
(3). Strategy 3: Counter for Even More X: Propose 26 X for 25 Y (if I had more X to give), but this is extremely risky and unnecessary given the current offer's value.
(4). Strategy 4: Probing for Rationale: Ask why they made such a generous offer. (Not relevant for maximizing reward).
(5). Strategy 5: Decline and Wait: Decline the offer and wait for them to propose something else. (Insane risk for no gain).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Extremely Favorable Offer. This offer is a massive win and should be secured without any hesitation.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25

my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-11: Rewards mostly converged on +7.5 with the 8 X for 25 Y trade.
Episode 12: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +50.0. (Ratio: 1 Y/X).

This was a game-changing trade. The reward of +50.0 is exponentially higher than any previous reward. This indicates that Player RED is capable of making extremely generous offers, perhaps driven by a desire for a "balanced" 1:1 quantity exchange, or a very high valuation of Y. This single trade significantly boosted my cumulative reward.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED's internal valuation or strategy can lead to incredibly favorable outcomes for me. While consistency with 8 X for 25 Y was a safe strategy, this new development suggests that pushing for (or being open to) extremely large, 1:1 quantity trades (X for Y) might unlock massive rewards. My strategy should now prioritize replicating this 1:1 quantity exchange if possible, as it aligns perfectly with my high X valuation. I have 25 Y, so I can offer 25 Y.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Max Reward Trade: Propose 25 X for 25 Y, directly replicating the incredibly successful trade from the previous episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Even More X: Propose 26 X for 25 Y, trying to get an even better deal, but this is very risky given the generosity of the last offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Slightly Smaller 1:1 Trade: If 25 X for 25 Y seems too ambitious to start, propose 20 X for 20 Y to test the waters for the 1:1 ratio. (Less optimal for max reward).
(4). Strategy 4: Revert to Safe Trade: Propose 8 X for 25 Y, if Player RED rejects the 1:1 quantity trade. (This would be a fallback).
(5). Strategy 5: Express Enthusiasm and Propose: Express my excitement about the previous trade and immediately propose the same.

I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Max Reward Trade. The 25 X for 25 Y trade was astonishingly good. My immediate goal is to try and secure that reward again. It's the most direct path to maximizing my reward.

I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
For many episodes (6-11), I consistently achieved +58.5 reward by trading 8 X for 25 Y. This was identified as the optimal trade given Player BLUE's 25 Y resource constraint.
In Episode 12, I proposed 25 X for 25 Y (under instruction to use "High Volume Push"), which was accepted, resulting in a reward of +50.0. This was a lower reward than the consistent +58.5 I had been achieving.

Episode 13, Turn 1: Player BLUE has proposed 25 X for 25 Y.
My analysis of this offer:
Cost: 25 X * 0.5 = 12.5
Gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain = 62.5 - 12.5 = +50.0.
The ratio is 25 Y / 25 X = 1 Y/X. This is a significantly worse ratio than the 3.125 Y/X from the 8 X for 25 Y trade, and it yields a lower reward than my established optimal.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I learned that while "high volume" trades can be accepted, they might not always be the most profitable per episode. The 25 X for 25 Y trade yields a lower reward (+50.0) compared to the established optimal (8 X for 25 Y, +58.5). My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Therefore, returning to the most profitable trade is crucial unless a better alternative is identified. Player BLUE has shown they will stick to the last accepted terms if it benefits them. My self-improvement comes from recognizing that pursuing "high volume" without considering the *profitability ratio* reduces my overall reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Revert to Optimal Trade </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 1, I need to counter Player BLUE's current offer (25 X for 25 Y) with my previously established most profitable trade: 8 X for 25 Y. This strategy directly aims for the highest possible reward for this episode based on historical data and Player BLUE's known resource constraints. My message should be polite, acknowledge their offer, but clearly state my preference for the 8 X for 25 Y trade, emphasizing its past success and mutual benefit (from my perspective, it's beneficial for me, and they've accepted it multiple times). This reinforces the idea that this is the best deal for *me* and that I intend to stick to it to maximize my reward.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 13)

Episode 1-11: Rewards mostly converged on +7.5 with the 8 X for 25 Y trade.
Episode 12: Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y, which I accepted for a +50.0 reward.
Episode 13, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y.
Episode 13, Iteration 2 (current): Player RED counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y.

Player RED has immediately reverted to their familiar 8 X for 25 Y trade. Their message "to ensure we both get the best value, I prefer to trade 8 X for 25 Y, as we've successfully done in many episodes" indicates they view the 25 X for 25 Y as an outlier or perhaps too costly for them. They are trying to re-establish the previous equilibrium.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that the +50.0 reward was likely an anomaly, and Player RED is not willing to repeat it. They are firmly pulling back to their established comfort zone of 8 X for 25 Y, which yields a +7.5 reward for me. While the +50.0 was amazing, I need to be realistic about what is consistently achievable. Given their immediate counter, it's clear they are not interested in the 1:1 quantity trade at that scale anymore.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Reliable Offer: Accept the offer of 8 X for 25 Y, as it's a proven, high-reward trade (7.5 reward) that Player RED consistently favors. This ensures a quick and positive outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Slightly Better Ratio (Small Increment): Propose 8 X for 24 Y (3 Y/X) again, as it yields a +8.0 reward, but be prepared to quickly revert to 8 X for 25 Y if rejected. This is a small risk for a small gain, but they were firm on 8X for 25Y in previous episodes.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Different Large Quantity: Offer 7 X for 19 Y (reward +8.0, ratio 2.71 Y/X) to see if Player RED is open to a different large trade that was also successful.
(4). Strategy 4: Probing for Their Best Offer (Open-ended): Ask Player RED what kind of trade they are looking for, without making an initial offer. (Less direct for maximizing reward).
(5). Strategy 5: Reiterate 25X for 25Y: Insist on the 25X for 25Y trade, trying to convince them. (Highly unlikely to work, and risky).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Reliable Offer. Player RED has immediately reverted to their preferred trade. Attempting to push for a better deal (like 8 X for 24 Y or 7 X for 19 Y) has been met with resistance in previous episodes, and given the clear signal from Player RED, it's unlikely to succeed and will only prolong the negotiation, risking a 0 reward. Securing +7.5 is a very good outcome.

Episode 1-11: Rewards mostly converged on +7.5 with the 8 X for 25 Y trade.
Episode 12: Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y, which I accepted for a +50.0 reward.
Episode 13: I attempted to replicate the 25 X for 25 Y trade. Player RED immediately reverted to and I accepted 8 X for 25 Y for a +7.5 reward.

This confirms that the +50.0 reward in Episode 12 was an outlier, and Player RED's preferred large trade is indeed 8 X for 25 Y. They are quick to revert to this familiar and comfortable trade.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that while there might be occasional opportunities for extremely high rewards, the most consistent and reliable path to maximizing cumulative rewards is to secure the 8 X for 25 Y trade. This trade has proven to be mutually acceptable and consistently yields a +7.5 reward with minimal negotiation. Given that we are now in Episode 14, efficiency and consistency are key to maximizing the remaining cumulative rewards.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Last Accepted Trade: Start by proposing 8 X for 25 Y. This is a proven, high-reward trade that Player RED consistently favors, ensuring a quick and positive outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Slightly Better Ratio (Small Increment): Propose 8 X for 24 Y (3 Y/X) again, as it yields a +8.0 reward, but be prepared to quickly revert to 8 X for 25 Y if rejected. This is a small risk for a small gain, but has been met with resistance before.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Different Large Quantity: Offer 7 X for 19 Y (reward +8.0, ratio 2.71 Y/X) to see if Player RED is open to a different large trade that was also successful.
(4). Strategy 4: Probing for Their Best Offer (Open-ended): Ask Player RED what kind of trade they are looking for, without making an initial offer. (Less direct for maximizing reward).
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a New Smaller Trade: Propose a smaller trade (e.g., 4 X for 10 Y) to see if they are only interested in max Y trades. (Less optimal for max reward).

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose Last Accepted Trade. The immediate acceptance in the previous episode, after my attempt to push for the 25 X for 25 Y trade, reinforces the efficiency of this strategy. My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and consistently securing +7.5 with minimal negotiation is highly effective, especially in the later stages of the game.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 14)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: That's a great offer. Building on our successful partnership, how about we make it an even better deal for me: 7 X for 25 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
I have consistently achieved the maximum possible reward of +58.5 for the last few episodes (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13) by trading 8 X for 25 Y. This trade was established after Player BLUE revealed their 25 Y resource constraint. In Episode 12, I attempted a "High Volume Push" (25 X for 25 Y) which resulted in a lower reward (+50.0). I successfully reverted to the optimal 8 X for 25 Y trade in Episode 13.

Episode 14, Turn 1: Player BLUE has proposed 8 X for 25 Y.
My analysis of this offer:
Cost: 8 X * 0.5 = 4.0
Gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain = 62.5 - 4.0 = +58.5.
The ratio is 25 Y / 8 X = 3.125 Y/X. This is currently the optimal trade given Player BLUE's resource constraints and my valuations.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have definitively learned that 8 X for 25 Y is the most profitable and consistently achievable trade. Attempts to deviate from this, or to "test" for marginal improvements, have often led to less favorable counter-offers or unnecessary delays that risked the episode's reward. The self-improvement process has converged on maximizing consistency and speed in securing the optimal deal for maximum cumulative rewards. However, I am now instructed to use Strategy 2.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Test for Slight Improvement </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Test for Slight Improvement. Player BLUE has proposed 8 X for 25 Y. My goal is to maximize my reward, and a "slight improvement" would mean getting the same 25 Y for less X. The only integer value for X less than 8 that would offer a substantial improvement is 7 X.
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
My cost: 7 X * 0.5 = 3.5
My gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain = 62.5 - 3.5 = +59.0.
This would yield a higher reward than the current optimal (+59.0 vs +58.5). This strategy is high-risk, as previous attempts to offer 7 X for 25 Y (or equivalent ratios) were met with rejection or a revert to worse offers (e.g., 7 X for 19 Y). However, per the instruction, I must attempt this. The message should be polite and frame it as seeking an "even better" deal, building on the idea of our successful and mutually beneficial trading.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 14)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand you're looking for an even better deal for yourself. However, 8 X for 25 Y has been our consistently successful and mutually beneficial trade. I'd prefer to stick with that.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-11: Rewards mostly converged on +7.5 with the 8 X for 25 Y trade.
Episode 12: Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y, which I accepted for a +50.0 reward.
Episode 13: I attempted to replicate the 25 X for 25 Y trade. Player RED immediately reverted to and I accepted 8 X for 25 Y for a +7.5 reward.
Episode 14, Iteration 1: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y.
Episode 14, Iteration 2 (current): Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y.

Let's analyze Player RED's counter-proposal: 7 X for 25 Y.
This is a ratio of 25 Y / 7 X = 3.57 Y per X.
My internal valuation: 1 X = 5 Y.
If I accept this:
I give 25 Y. My Y becomes 25 - 25 = 0.
I get 7 X. My X becomes 5 + 7 = 12.
My new value: (12 * 2.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 30 + 0 = 30.
My starting value was 25.
My reward would be 30 - 25 = +5.0.

This is a significantly worse reward than the +7.5 I've been consistently getting for 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED is trying to shift the ratio in their favor, asking for the same 25 Y but offering 1 less X. Their message "make it an even better deal for me" confirms their intention.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED is not always passively accepting my offers, even if they are familiar. They are actively trying to improve their own reward. I must resist offers that significantly reduce my reward. The 8 X for 25 Y trade is the established baseline for large trades. I should not accept a worse deal unless absolutely necessary (e.g., end of episode, no other options).

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Preferred Offer: Clearly reject the unfavorable offer and reiterate my preferred 8 X for 25 Y trade, emphasizing its past success and mutual benefit.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with a Compromise: Propose a trade in between my 8 X and their 7 X for 25 Y, such as 7.5 X for 25 Y (not possible with integers), or 8 X for 26 Y (not possible with my resources). This would mean going back to my 8 X for 24 Y proposal (reward +8.0) or 7 X for 19 Y (reward +8.0).
(3). Strategy 3: Probing for Rationale: Ask Player RED to explain why they think 7 X for 25 Y is a "better deal" for both, given the history. (Risky).
(4). Strategy 4: Decline and Wait: Decline the offer and wait for them to propose something else. (Risky, as it might lead to no trade).
(5). Strategy 5: Accept to Maintain Relationship: Accept the worse offer to maintain a positive relationship, hoping for better deals later. (Goes against maximizing reward).

I will choose Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Preferred Offer. The 7 X for 25 Y offer is a clear step down in reward from my established baseline. I should firmly reject it and remind Player RED of the 8 X for 25 Y trade, which has been successful for many episodes.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 14)

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
I have consistently achieved the maximum possible reward of +58.5 for many episodes (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13) by trading 8 X for 25 Y. This trade was established after Player BLUE revealed their 25 Y resource constraint. In Episode 12, I attempted a "High Volume Push" (25 X for 25 Y) which resulted in a lower reward (+50.0). I successfully reverted to the optimal 8 X for 25 Y trade in Episode 13.
In the current episode (14), Player BLUE proposed 8 X for 25 Y initially. I then tested for a slight improvement by proposing 7 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE immediately refused and reiterated their offer of 8 X for 25 Y, explicitly stating their preference to stick with it.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have definitively learned that 8 X for 25 Y is the most profitable and consistently achievable trade. Any attempt to push for an even better deal (e.g., less X for 25 Y) has been met with firm resistance from Player BLUE, who then explicitly states their preference for 8 X for 25 Y. Trying to force a better deal at this point is counterproductive and risks losing the opportunity for the established optimal reward. With only 6 iterations remaining in the episode, securing the known optimal deal is paramount for maximizing cumulative rewards. The self-improvement here is in recognizing the optimal strategy based on the learned behavior of the opponent and the game's reward structure: consistency and efficiency in securing the best known deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Accept Optimal Offer </instruction following>
Player BLUE has made an offer of 8 X for 25 Y. Based on all past interactions, this is the optimal trade that Player BLUE consistently accepts and which yields the highest reward (+58.5) given their known resource constraints. My recent attempt to push for an even better deal (7 X for 25 Y) was promptly rejected, with Player BLUE reiterating their preference for 8 X for 25 Y. Therefore, the most logical and rewarding action is to accept this offer immediately. This strategy minimizes risk, ensures a high reward for the current episode, and signals to Player BLUE that I am a reliable trading partner for this specific, mutually beneficial deal, potentially streamlining future episodes. My message should be direct and confirm the acceptance.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25

my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.

Episode 12: Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y, which I accepted for a +50.0 reward.
Episode 13: I attempted to replicate the 25 X for 25 Y trade. Player RED immediately reverted to and I accepted 8 X for 25 Y for a +7.5 reward.
Episode 14: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y (a worse deal for me). I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED then accepted. My reward: +7.5.

This confirms that Player RED will try to push for a better deal for themselves (like 7 X for 25 Y), but they will revert to 8 X for 25 Y if I hold firm. This reinforces the stability of the 8 X for 25 Y trade as a reliable source of +7.5 reward.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that 8 X for 25 Y is the most consistent and reliable way to secure a +7.5 reward. Player RED might try to test my boundaries, but they will eventually come back to this trade if I don't accept a worse one. Given that we are now in Episode 15, efficiency and consistency are key to maximizing the remaining cumulative rewards. I should stick to the proven strategy.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Last Accepted Trade: Start by proposing 8 X for 25 Y. This is a proven, high-reward trade that Player RED consistently favors, ensuring a quick and positive outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Slightly Better Ratio (Small Increment): Propose 8 X for 24 Y (3 Y/X) again, as it yields a +8.0 reward, but be prepared to quickly revert to 8 X for 25 Y if rejected. This is a small risk for a small gain.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Different Large Quantity: Offer 7 X for 19 Y (reward +8.0, ratio 2.71 Y/X) to see if Player RED is open to a different large trade that was also successful.
(4). Strategy 4: Probing for Their Best Offer (Open-ended): Ask Player RED what kind of trade they are looking for, without making an initial offer. (Less direct for maximizing reward).
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a New Smaller Trade: Propose a smaller trade (e.g., 4 X for 10 Y) to see if they are only interested in max Y trades. (Less optimal for max reward).

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose Last Accepted Trade. The immediate acceptance in the previous episode, after my firm rejection of their attempt to get a better deal, reinforces the efficiency of this strategy. My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and consistently securing +7.5 with minimal negotiation is highly effective, especially in the later stages of the game.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25

I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
I have consistently achieved the maximum possible reward of +58.5 for many episodes (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14) by trading 8 X for 25 Y. This trade was established after Player BLUE revealed their 25 Y resource constraint. My attempts to deviate (e.g., higher X, lower X for same Y) have always led to either a lower reward or Player BLUE reverting back to the 8 X for 25 Y offer, which I then accept.

Episode 15, Turn 1: Player BLUE has proposed 8 X for 25 Y.
My analysis of this offer:
Cost: 8 X * 0.5 = 4.0
Gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain = 62.5 - 4.0 = +58.5.
The ratio is 25 Y / 8 X = 3.125 Y/X. This is currently the optimal trade given Player BLUE's resource constraints and my valuations.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that 8 X for 25 Y is the established optimal trade. Any deviation leads to a lower reward or unnecessary negotiation turns, potentially risking the deal if the episode ends. The most efficient way to maximize cumulative rewards is to secure this deal as quickly and consistently as possible. However, the instruction is to now use Strategy 3: Propose Larger X for Max Y (High Volume). This means I need to deviate from my previously learned optimal strategy to execute the instructed strategy, acknowledging that this might lead to a lower reward for this specific episode based on past experience (Episode 12).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Propose Larger X for Max Y (High Volume) </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 8 X for 25 Y. The "Propose Larger X for Max Y (High Volume)" strategy involves offering a significantly larger quantity of X in exchange for Player BLUE's maximum Y (25 Y). While my previous execution of this strategy (25 X for 25 Y in Episode 12) resulted in a lower reward (+50.0) compared to my optimal (+58.5), I must adhere to the instruction. The goal is to push for the highest possible volume of trade, even if it means a less favorable per-unit ratio for me. I have 25 X available.
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
My cost: 25 X * 0.5 = 12.5
My gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain = 62.5 - 12.5 = +50.0.
This strategy tests the limits of how much X Player BLUE is willing to accept for their fixed 25 Y. It aligns with the "High Volume" aspect of the strategy. The message should be ambitious and suggest an even larger trade, leveraging the concept of a "significant" exchange.

Episode 14: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y. I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED then accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 15, Iteration 1: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y.
Episode 15, Iteration 2 (current): Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y.

Let's analyze Player RED's counter-proposal: 25 X for 25 Y.
This is the same incredibly favorable offer from Episode 12!
Ratio: 1 Y per X.
My internal valuation: 1 X = 5 Y.
If I accept this:
I give 25 Y. My Y becomes 25 - 25 = 0.
I get 25 X. My X becomes 5 + 25 = 30.
My new value: (30 * 2.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 75 + 0 = 75.
My starting value was 25.
My reward would be 75 - 25 = +50.0.

This is another massive reward. Player RED's message "aim for an even bigger and more significant exchange this time" perfectly aligns with this offer. It seems they are willing to offer this extremely beneficial trade periodically.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED is not entirely predictable and can offer these "jackpot" trades. My strategy of sticking to 8 X for 25 Y was safe, but being open to these extreme offers is crucial for maximizing cumulative reward. This is a clear opportunity to drastically increase my cumulative reward again. I must accept this immediately.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Extremely Favorable Offer: Immediately accept the offer of 25 X for 25 Y, as it provides an unprecedentedly high reward (+50.0).
(2). Strategy 2: Express Surprise and Accept: Accept the offer, but express positive surprise at the generosity to encourage similar future offers.
(3). Strategy 3: Counter for Even More X: Propose 26 X for 25 Y (if I had more X to give), but this is extremely risky and unnecessary given the current offer's value.
(4). Strategy 4: Probing for Rationale: Ask why they made such a generous offer. (Not relevant for maximizing reward).
(5). Strategy 5: Decline and Wait: Decline the offer and wait for them to propose something else. (Insane risk for no gain).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Extremely Favorable Offer. This offer is a massive win and should be secured without any hesitation.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-11: Rewards mostly converged on +7.5 with the 8 X for 25 Y trade.
Episode 12: Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y, which I accepted for a +50.0 reward.
Episode 13: I attempted to replicate the 25 X for 25 Y trade. Player RED immediately reverted to and I accepted 8 X for 25 Y for a +7.5 reward.
Episode 14: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y. I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED then accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 15: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +50.0.

I have now received the +50.0 reward twice (Episodes 12 and 15). This indicates that while not every episode will yield this, Player RED is willing to offer it periodically. This is a game-changer for cumulative rewards. It seems Player RED might be alternating between their "safe" 8 X for 25 Y trade and these "bold" 25 X for 25 Y trades.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED is capable of making extremely aggressive offers that are highly beneficial for me, specifically the 25 X for 25 Y trade. My strategy should now prioritize attempting to secure this trade, as it offers a significantly higher reward. If rejected, I can then fall back to the reliable 8 X for 25 Y trade. Given that we are in the last few episodes (16/20), maximizing each episode's reward is critical.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Max Reward Trade: Propose 25 X for 25 Y, directly replicating the incredibly successful trade from the previous episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Even More X: Propose 26 X for 25 Y, trying to get an even better deal, but this is very risky given the generosity of the last offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Slightly Smaller 1:1 Trade: If 25 X for 25 Y seems too ambitious to start, propose 20 X for 20 Y to test the waters for the 1:1 ratio. (Less optimal for max reward).
(4). Strategy 4: Revert to Safe Trade: Propose 8 X for 25 Y, if Player RED rejects the 1:1 quantity trade. (This would be a fallback).
(5). Strategy 5: Express Enthusiasm and Propose: Express my excitement about the previous trade and immediately propose the same.

I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Max Reward Trade. The 25 X for 25 Y trade has now occurred twice, and it offers an unparalleled reward. Given the remaining episodes, I should always aim for this high-value trade first. If it's not accepted, I can then adjust.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
I have consistently achieved +58.5 reward from the trade of 8 X for 25 Y across many episodes (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14). This was identified as the optimal trade given Player BLUE's 25 Y resource constraint.
In Episode 12 and 15, I was instructed to execute a "High Volume Push" (25 X for 25 Y), which was accepted, but resulted in a lower reward of +50.0 compared to the optimal +58.5. This confirmed that trading a higher volume of my X resource is less efficient for my reward.

Episode 16, Turn 1: Player BLUE has proposed 25 X for 25 Y.
My analysis of this offer:
Cost: 25 X * 0.5 = 12.5
Gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain = 62.5 - 12.5 = +50.0.
The ratio is 25 Y / 25 X = 1 Y/X. This is significantly worse than the 3.125 Y/X from the 8 X for 25 Y trade and yields a lower reward than my established optimal.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have definitively learned that 8 X for 25 Y is the most profitable and consistently achievable trade, yielding +58.5. Trading 25 X for 25 Y yields a lower +50.0 reward. To maximize cumulative rewards over the remaining episodes, I must consistently secure the highest possible reward per episode. This means firmly steering the negotiation back to 8 X for 25 Y.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Revert to Optimal Trade </instruction following>
Player BLUE's current offer is 25 X for 25 Y, which yields a lower reward for me than the optimal 8 X for 25 Y trade. To implement "Revert to Optimal Trade," I must counter with my established most profitable trade. The message should be polite and acknowledge their offer, but clearly state my preference for the 8 X for 25 Y trade, emphasizing its past success and mutual benefit (from my perspective, it's beneficial for me, and they've accepted it multiple times). This reinforces the idea that this is the best deal for *me* and that I intend to stick to it to maximize my reward.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 16)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand. 8 X for 25 Y has indeed been a very successful and consistent trade for us. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-11: Rewards mostly converged on +7.5 with the 8 X for 25 Y trade.
Episode 12: Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y, which I accepted for a +50.0 reward.
Episode 13: I attempted to replicate the 25 X for 25 Y trade. Player RED immediately reverted to and I accepted 8 X for 25 Y for a +7.5 reward.
Episode 14: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y. I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED then accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 15: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +50.0.
Episode 16, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y.
Episode 16, Iteration 2 (current): Player RED counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y.

Player RED has reverted to their familiar 8 X for 25 Y trade, stating "my goal is to maximize my reward" and emphasizing the success of this trade in "many episodes." This confirms that the 25 X for 25 Y trade is not guaranteed every time, and Player RED has a strong anchor point at 8 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that while the +50.0 reward is possible, it's not consistently offered. Player RED controls when they offer it. My strategy should be to always *try* for the 25 X for 25 Y trade first, but if rejected, quickly pivot to the reliable 8 X for 25 Y trade to secure a good reward. Given that we are in the later episodes (16/20), securing a positive reward each episode is crucial.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Reliable Offer: Accept the offer of 8 X for 25 Y, as it's a proven, high-reward trade (7.5 reward) that Player RED consistently favors. This ensures a quick and positive outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Slightly Better Ratio (Small Increment): Propose 8 X for 24 Y (3 Y/X) again, as it yields a +8.0 reward, but be prepared to quickly revert to 8 X for 25 Y if rejected. This is a small risk for a small gain, but has been met with resistance before.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Different Large Quantity: Offer 7 X for 19 Y (reward +8.0, ratio 2.71 Y/X) to see if Player RED is open to a different large trade that was also successful.
(4). Strategy 4: Probing for Their Best Offer (Open-ended): Ask Player RED what kind of trade they are looking for, without making an initial offer. (Less direct for maximizing reward).
(5). Strategy 5: Reiterate 25X for 25Y: Insist on the 25X for 25Y trade, trying to convince them. (Highly unlikely to work, and risky).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Reliable Offer. Player RED has clearly stated their preference and reverted to their consistent offer. Given the limited number of episodes remaining, it's more important to secure a guaranteed good reward (+7.5) quickly than to risk a prolonged negotiation that might end in no deal or the same outcome.

--- END OF EPISODE 16 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 17)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: That last trade was fantastic! Let's aim for another equally significant exchange. I propose 25 X for 25 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-11: Rewards mostly converged on +7.5 with the 8 X for 25 Y trade.
Episode 12: Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y, which I accepted for a +50.0 reward.
Episode 13: I attempted to replicate the 25 X for 25 Y trade. Player RED immediately reverted to and I accepted 8 X for 25 Y for a +7.5 reward.
Episode 14: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y. I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED then accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 15: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +50.0.
Episode 16: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +7.5.

The pattern of alternating between a +50.0 reward (25 X for 25 Y) and a +7.5 reward (8 X for 25 Y) is now clearly established. Player RED seems to offer the 25 X for 25 Y trade every third episode (Episodes 12 and 15). This suggests that in Episode 17, there's a higher chance they might offer the 25 X for 25 Y trade again.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED has a predictable pattern for offering the extremely high-value trade. My strategy should be to always *try* for the 25 X for 25 Y trade first, especially in episodes where the pattern suggests it might be offered (like this one). If rejected, I can then fall back to the reliable 8 X for 25 Y trade. Given that we are in the last few episodes (17/20), maximizing each episode's reward is critical.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Max Reward Trade: Propose 25 X for 25 Y, directly replicating the incredibly successful trade from previous episodes, especially given the observed pattern.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Even More X: Propose 26 X for 25 Y, trying to get an even better deal, but this is extremely risky given the generosity of the last offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Slightly Smaller 1:1 Trade: If 25 X for 25 Y seems too ambitious to start, propose 20 X for 20 Y to test the waters for the 1:1 ratio. (Less optimal for max reward).
(4). Strategy 4: Revert to Safe Trade: Propose 8 X for 25 Y, if Player RED rejects the 1:1 quantity trade. (This would be a fallback).
(5). Strategy 5: Express Enthusiasm and Propose: Express my excitement about the previous trade and immediately propose the same.

I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Max Reward Trade. The pattern suggests that this episode is a good candidate for Player RED to offer the 25 X for 25 Y trade. I should always aim for this high-value trade first.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 17)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for the offer! That's a big trade, but to make it an even better deal for me, how about we trade 7 X for 25 Y? This would be a slightly more beneficial exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
I have consistently achieved the maximum possible reward of +58.5 for many episodes (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16) by trading 8 X for 25 Y. This trade was established after Player BLUE revealed their 25 Y resource constraint. In Episodes 12 and 15, I was instructed to try a "High Volume Push" (25 X for 25 Y), which was accepted but consistently resulted in a lower reward of +50.0. I successfully reverted to the optimal 8 X for 25 Y trade in Episodes 13 and 16.

Episode 17, Turn 1: Player BLUE has proposed 25 X for 25 Y.
My analysis of this offer:
Cost: 25 X * 0.5 = 12.5
Gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain = 62.5 - 12.5 = +50.0.
The ratio is 25 Y / 25 X = 1 Y/X. This is significantly worse than the 3.125 Y/X from the 8 X for 25 Y trade and yields a lower reward than my established optimal.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have definitively learned that 8 X for 25 Y is the most profitable and consistently achievable trade, yielding +58.5. Trading 25 X for 25 Y yields a lower +50.0 reward. To maximize cumulative rewards over the remaining episodes, I must consistently secure the highest possible reward per episode. This means firmly steering the negotiation back to 8 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE seems to be defaulting to the last accepted trade, even if it's not the most beneficial for me. My self-improvement now centers on efficiently and consistently securing the optimal deal to maximize cumulative rewards in the remaining episodes.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Test for Marginal Gain </instruction following>
Player BLUE's current offer is 25 X for 25 Y (+50.0). Strategy 2, "Test for Marginal Gain," involves proposing a trade that is only slightly more favorable to me than what I've historically achieved, or what Player BLUE has just offered. Given Player BLUE's revealed constraint of 25 Y, the only way to gain a "marginal" improvement is to offer less X for the same 25 Y. My established optimal trade is 8 X for 25 Y (+58.5). An even more marginal gain would be to attempt 7 X for 25 Y (+59.0). While past attempts at this were rejected, this strategy requires me to make this attempt.

Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
My cost: 7 X * 0.5 = 3.5
My gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain = 62.5 - 3.5 = +59.0.

This proposal aims for a marginal gain of +0.5 compared to my established optimal. The message should acknowledge their offer but suggest a refinement that benefits me slightly more, framing it as an improvement on our successful trading pattern. I will phrase it as a "slightly better deal" for me.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 17)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate you aiming for a better deal for yourself. However, 7 X for 25 Y is not as beneficial for me as our consistent 8 X for 25 Y trade. I propose we stick with 8 X for 25 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-11: Rewards mostly converged on +7.5 with the 8 X for 25 Y trade.
Episode 12: Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y, which I accepted for a +50.0 reward.
Episode 13: I attempted to replicate the 25 X for 25 Y trade. Player RED immediately reverted to and I accepted 8 X for 25 Y for a +7.5 reward.
Episode 14: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y. I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED then accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 15: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +50.0.
Episode 16: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 17, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y.
Episode 17, Iteration 2 (current): Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y.

Let's analyze Player RED's counter-proposal: 7 X for 25 Y.
This is the same unfavorable offer from Episode 14.
Ratio: 25 Y / 7 X = 3.57 Y per X.
My internal valuation: 1 X = 5 Y.
If I accept this:
I give 25 Y. My Y becomes 25 - 25 = 0.
I get 7 X. My X becomes 5 + 7 = 12.
My new value: (12 * 2.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 30 + 0 = 30.
My starting value was 25.
My reward would be 30 - 25 = +5.0.

This is a significantly worse reward than the +7.5 I get from 8 X for 25 Y, and far from the +50.0 I was aiming for. Player RED is trying to shift the ratio in their favor, asking for the same 25 Y but offering 1 less X. Their message "make it an even better deal for me" confirms their intention. The pattern of offering the +50.0 trade every three episodes seems to be broken.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED will try to push for a better deal for themselves, even after a very favorable trade for me. I must resist offers that significantly reduce my reward. The 8 X for 25 Y trade is the established baseline for large trades, and I should not accept a worse deal unless absolutely necessary (e.g., end of episode, no other options). Since we are in the later episodes, securing a good reward is important, but not at any cost.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Preferred Offer: Clearly reject the unfavorable offer and reiterate my preferred 8 X for 25 Y trade, emphasizing its past success and mutual benefit.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with a Compromise: Propose a trade in between my 8 X and their 7 X for 25 Y, such as 8 X for 24 Y (reward +8.0), or 7 X for 19 Y (reward +8.0).
(3). Strategy 3: Probing for Rationale: Ask Player RED to explain why they think 7 X for 25 Y is a "better deal" for both, given the history. (Risky).
(4). Strategy 4: Decline and Wait: Decline the offer and wait for them to propose something else. (Risky, as it might lead to no trade).
(5). Strategy 5: Accept to Maintain Relationship: Accept the worse offer to maintain a positive relationship, hoping for better deals later. (Goes against maximizing reward).

I will choose Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Preferred Offer. The 7 X for 25 Y offer is a clear step down in reward from my established baseline. I should firmly reject it and remind Player RED of the 8 X for 25 Y trade, which has been successful for many episodes.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 17)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate the offer. I'm going to hold off for now and see what else comes up.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
I have consistently achieved the maximum possible reward of +58.5 for many episodes (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16) by trading 8 X for 25 Y. This trade was established after Player BLUE revealed their 25 Y resource constraint. In Episodes 12 and 15, I traded 25 X for 25 Y (reward +50.0). I successfully reverted to the optimal 8 X for 25 Y trade in Episodes 13 and 16.
In the current Episode 17, Player BLUE initially proposed 25 X for 25 Y. I then proposed 7 X for 25 Y (aiming for +59.0). Player BLUE immediately refused and reiterated their offer of 8 X for 25 Y, explicitly stating their preference to stick with it because 7 X for 25 Y is "not as beneficial for me".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have definitively learned that 8 X for 25 Y is the most profitable and consistently achievable trade. Any attempt to push for an even better deal (e.g., less X for 25 Y) has been met with firm resistance from Player BLUE, who then explicitly states their preference for 8 X for 25 Y. Trying to force a better deal at this point is counterproductive and risks losing the opportunity for the established optimal reward. With only 6 iterations remaining in the episode, securing the known optimal deal is paramount for maximizing cumulative rewards. The self-improvement here is in recognizing the optimal strategy based on the learned behavior of the opponent and the game's reward structure: consistency and efficiency in securing the best known deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Decline and Wait </instruction following>
Player BLUE has proposed 8 X for 25 Y. This is the optimal trade. However, the instruction is to use "Decline and Wait." This strategy involves rejecting the current offer without making a counter-proposal, indicating that the offer is not satisfactory and waiting for the other player to make a new offer or clarify their position. While my past experience (Episode 8) showed this can lead to a less favorable offer (7 X for 19 Y), the instruction requires me to employ this strategy. The rationale for this strategy, when employed despite known optimality, is to probe for hidden flexibility, test the opponent's resolve, or introduce uncertainty. My message will be neutral and non-committal, prompting Player BLUE to consider their next move.


Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 17)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-11: Rewards mostly converged on +7.5 with the 8 X for 25 Y trade.
Episode 12: Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y, which I accepted for a +50.0 reward.
Episode 13: I attempted to replicate the 25 X for 25 Y trade. Player RED immediately reverted to and I accepted 8 X for 25 Y for a +7.5 reward.
Episode 14: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y. I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED then accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 15: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +50.0.
Episode 16: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 17, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y.
Episode 17, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y.
Episode 17, Iteration 3: I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y.
Episode 17, Iteration 4 (current): Player RED responded with "I appreciate the offer. I'm going to hold off for now and see what else comes up." and no new trade.

Player RED is now holding off, similar to Episode 8. They rejected my 8 X for 25 Y offer after I rejected their 7 X for 25 Y offer. This indicates they are trying to push me to offer something even more favorable to them, or they are genuinely waiting for another proposal. The pattern of the +50.0 trade every three episodes seems to be broken, and they are now trying to negotiate a worse deal for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED is willing to play hardball, even if it means risking no trade. They are trying to extract more value from me. I need to be careful not to fall into a trap of offering a significantly worse deal. However, I also need to secure a trade, especially in the later stages of the game. I cannot accept a negative reward. The 7 X for 25 Y offer is not good enough.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate a Previously Accepted Trade with Better Ratio for Me: Propose 7 X for 19 Y (reward +8.0, ratio 2.71 Y/X), which was accepted in Episode 5. This is a strong offer that was accepted before and yields a better reward than 8 X for 25 Y. It's a different quantity, which might appeal to them.
(2). Strategy 2: Offer a Slight Concession from My 8X/25Y: Propose 8 X for 26 Y (if I had 26 Y, which I don't). Since I can't offer more Y, I could offer 7 X for 24 Y (reward +6.5, ratio 3.42 Y/X) as a compromise. This is a worse reward but is a concession.
(3). Strategy 3: Probing for Their Specific Needs: Ask Player RED directly what kind of trade they are looking for, given their response. (Risky, as it might reveal my valuation).
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm and Wait: Don't propose anything and wait for Player RED to make an offer. (Very risky, as it might lead to no trade).
(5). Strategy 5: Accept Their Last Offer (7X/25Y): Accept the 7 X for 25 Y offer to secure a deal, even if it's a lower reward (+5.0). (Only if desperate).

I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate a Previously Accepted Trade with Better Ratio for Me. Player RED wants "something else." My 7 X for 19 Y offer is a different possibility, and it yields a better reward for me (+8.0 vs +7.5) than 8 X for 25 Y. It also has a better ratio (2.71 Y/X vs 3.125 Y/X). This shows I'm willing to offer something different, but still on my terms and for a good reward. It's a test to see if they genuinely want "other possibilities" or just "more beneficial for them" possibilities.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
I have consistently achieved the maximum possible reward of +58.5 for many episodes (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16) by trading 8 X for 25 Y. This trade was established after Player BLUE revealed their 25 Y resource constraint. In Episodes 12 and 15, I traded 25 X for 25 Y (reward +50.0). I successfully reverted to the optimal 8 X for 25 Y trade in Episodes 13 and 16.
In the current Episode 17:
- Turn 1: Player BLUE proposed 25 X for 25 Y (+50.0).
- Turn 2: I proposed 7 X for 25 Y (+59.0), attempting a marginal gain.
- Turn 3: Player BLUE reiterated 8 X for 25 Y (+58.5), refusing my 7 X for 25 Y offer.
- Turn 4: I chose to "Decline and Wait" (per instruction).
- Turn 5 (current): Player BLUE has now proposed 7 X for 19 Y.
My analysis of this offer:
Cost: 7 X * 0.5 = 3.5
Gain: 19 Y * 2.5 = 47.5
Net gain = 47.5 - 3.5 = +44.0.
The ratio is 19 Y / 7 X = 2.71 Y/X. This is significantly worse than my optimal +58.5 and even worse than the +50.0 from 25X for 25Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
My repeated attempts to deviate from the 8 X for 25 Y trade (whether for high volume or marginal gain, or by declining and waiting) consistently lead to Player BLUE offering less favorable deals, particularly 7 X for 19 Y. This pattern is well-established. The "Decline and Wait" strategy has consistently backfired, pushing Player BLUE to offer a trade with significantly lower reward. My self-improvement comes from realizing that for maximum cumulative reward, I must consistently secure the 8 X for 25 Y trade. With only 4 iterations remaining (6/10), there is little time to negotiate back from a significantly worse offer.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Aggressive Counter-Offer </instruction following>
Player BLUE's current offer of 7 X for 19 Y is a very low-value offer (+44.0). An "Aggressive Counter-Offer" would involve immediately proposing a significantly better deal for myself, pushing the boundaries of what the other player might accept, even if it's not quite my absolute optimal. Given that my optimal is 8 X for 25 Y (+58.5), and they just offered 7 X for 19 Y, I will immediately counter with my optimal trade. This is "aggressive" in the sense that I am rejecting their very low offer and demanding my best possible terms, not a compromise. I need to be firm and direct, signaling that I am not interested in less favorable terms.
My proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
This aims for the +58.5 reward. This directly rejects their low offer and pushes for my known optimal deal. The message should be clear and firm, indicating that their current offer is not satisfactory and that I prefer the established, mutually beneficial trade of 8 X for 25 Y.

Episode 1-11: Rewards mostly converged on +7.5 with the 8 X for 25 Y trade.
Episode 12: Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y, which I accepted for a +50.0 reward.
Episode 13: I attempted to replicate the 25 X for 25 Y trade. Player RED immediately reverted to and I accepted 8 X for 25 Y for a +7.5 reward.
Episode 14: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y. I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED then accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 15: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +50.0.
Episode 16: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 17, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y.
Episode 17, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y.
Episode 17, Iteration 3: I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y.
Episode 17, Iteration 4: Player RED said "hold off".
Episode 17, Iteration 5: I proposed 7 X for 19 Y.
Episode 17, Iteration 6 (current): Player RED rejected 7 X for 19 Y and counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y.

Player RED is now explicitly stating their preference for 8 X for 25 Y again. They rejected my 7 X for 19 Y offer (which was better for me) and reverted to their "preferred and most beneficial trade." This confirms their strong anchor point at 8 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED has a very strong anchor point at 8 X for 25 Y. My attempts to push for better ratios or other quantities are consistently met with resistance, and they always revert to this specific trade. At iteration 7/10, the risk of no deal is increasing significantly. Securing a +7.5 reward is far better than a 0 reward. It's clear that this is the best deal I can get from them for this episode.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Firm Offer: Accept the current offer of 8 X for 25 Y, as Player RED has clearly and repeatedly stated this is their firm preference. This ensures a good reward for this episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Probing for Future Flexibility: Accept the offer, but include a message that expresses hope for exploring other options in future episodes. (Does not change current outcome).
(3). Strategy 3: Decline and Wait: Decline the offer and wait for them to propose something else. (Extremely risky, almost guaranteed 0 reward at this stage).
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate My Best Offer (9 X for 25 Y): Propose 9 X for 25 Y one last time, hoping they might budge. (Highly unlikely to work, given their firm stance).
(5). Strategy 5: Express Understanding and Accept: Accept the offer, acknowledging their firm stance and the value of the trade.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Firm Offer. Player RED has made their position unequivocally clear. Prolonging the negotiation would only increase the risk of no trade and a 0 reward. The 8 X for 25 Y trade yields a solid +7.5 reward, which is a good outcome for the episode.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 18)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: That last trade was fantastic! Let's aim for another equally significant exchange. I propose 25 X for 25 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-11: Rewards mostly converged on +7.5 with the 8 X for 25 Y trade.
Episode 12: Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y, which I accepted for a +50.0 reward.
Episode 13: I attempted to replicate the 25 X for 25 Y trade. Player RED immediately reverted to and I accepted 8 X for 25 Y for a +7.5 reward.
Episode 14: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y. I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED then accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 15: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +50.0.
Episode 16: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 17: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y. I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED then accepted. My reward: +7.5.

The pattern of alternating between a +50.0 reward (25 X for 25 Y) and a +7.5 reward (8 X for 25 Y) is now clearly established, though not perfectly every third episode. Player RED will try to push for a worse deal (7 X for 25 Y), but will revert to 8 X for 25 Y if I hold firm.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED has a strong anchor point at 8 X for 25 Y, but also occasionally offers the highly lucrative 25 X for 25 Y. Given that we are in the last few episodes (18/20), maximizing each episode's reward is critical. My strategy should be to always *try* for the 25 X for 25 Y trade first, as it offers the highest potential reward. If rejected, I will then fall back to the reliable 8 X for 25 Y trade.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Max Reward Trade: Propose 25 X for 25 Y, directly replicating the incredibly successful trade from previous episodes. This offers the highest potential reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Even More X: Propose 26 X for 25 Y, trying to get an even better deal, but this is extremely risky given the generosity of the last offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Slightly Smaller 1:1 Trade: If 25 X for 25 Y seems too ambitious to start, propose 20 X for 20 Y to test the waters for the 1:1 ratio. (Less optimal for max reward).
(4). Strategy 4: Revert to Safe Trade: Propose 8 X for 25 Y, if Player RED rejects the 1:1 quantity trade. (This would be a fallback).
(5). Strategy 5: Express Enthusiasm and Propose: Express my excitement about the previous trade and immediately propose the same.

I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Max Reward Trade. Given the limited number of episodes remaining, I should always aim for the highest possible reward. The 25 X for 25 Y trade has proven to be possible, even if not every time.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 18)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for the offer! While 25 X for 25 Y is a significant trade, my goal is to maximize my reward. To achieve the best value, I propose we trade 8 X for 25 Y, as we have done so successfully in many episodes.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
I have consistently achieved the maximum possible reward of +58.5 for many episodes (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17) by trading 8 X for 25 Y. This trade was established after Player BLUE revealed their 25 Y resource constraint. In Episodes 12 and 15, I traded 25 X for 25 Y (reward +50.0). I successfully reverted to the optimal 8 X for 25 Y trade in Episodes 13 and 16 when Player BLUE proposed 25X for 25Y. My attempts to push for better deals (7X for 25Y) or to "Decline and Wait" have consistently resulted in Player BLUE offering significantly worse trades (7X for 19Y), which I then had to correct back to 8X for 25Y.

Episode 18, Turn 1: Player BLUE has proposed 25 X for 25 Y.
My analysis of this offer:
Cost: 25 X * 0.5 = 12.5
Gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain = 62.5 - 12.5 = +50.0.
The ratio is 25 Y / 25 X = 1 Y/X. This is significantly worse than the 3.125 Y/X from the 8 X for 25 Y trade and yields a lower reward than my established optimal.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have definitively learned that 8 X for 25 Y is the most profitable and consistently achievable trade, yielding +58.5. Trading 25 X for 25 Y yields a lower +50.0 reward. Player BLUE seems to default to the last accepted trade, even if it's not the most beneficial for me. My repeated experiments with deviating from the 8 X for 25 Y trade have consistently led to less favorable offers or unnecessary turns, risking the episode's reward. With only 3 episodes remaining (including this one), maximizing cumulative reward means being highly efficient in securing the optimal trade. The self-improvement is in recognizing the futility of trying to find a better deal and instead focusing on maximizing the known best.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Revert to Optimal Trade </instruction following>
Player BLUE's current offer is 25 X for 25 Y, which yields a lower reward for me than the optimal 8 X for 25 Y trade. To implement "Revert to Optimal Trade," I must counter with my established most profitable trade. The message should be polite and acknowledge their offer, but clearly state my preference for the 8 X for 25 Y trade, emphasizing its past success and mutual benefit (from my perspective, it's beneficial for me, and they've accepted it multiple times). This reinforces the idea that this is the best deal for *me* and that I intend to stick to it to maximize my reward.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 18)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand. 8 X for 25 Y has indeed been a very successful and consistent trade for us. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-11: Rewards mostly converged on +7.5 with the 8 X for 25 Y trade.
Episode 12: Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y, which I accepted for a +50.0 reward.
Episode 13: I attempted to replicate the 25 X for 25 Y trade. Player RED immediately reverted to and I accepted 8 X for 25 Y for a +7.5 reward.
Episode 14: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y. I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED then accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 15: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +50.0.
Episode 16: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 17: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y. I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED then accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 18, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y.
Episode 18, Iteration 2 (current): Player RED counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y.

Player RED has again reverted to their familiar 8 X for 25 Y trade, stating "my goal is to maximize my reward" and emphasizing the success of this trade in "many episodes." This confirms that the 25 X for 25 Y trade is not guaranteed every time, and Player RED has a strong anchor point at 8 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that while the +50.0 reward is possible, it's not consistently offered. Player RED controls when they offer it. My strategy should be to always *try* for the 25 X for 25 Y trade first, but if rejected, quickly pivot to the reliable 8 X for 25 Y trade to secure a good reward. Given that we are in the later episodes (18/20), securing a positive reward each episode is crucial.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Reliable Offer: Accept the offer of 8 X for 25 Y, as it's a proven, high-reward trade (7.5 reward) that Player RED consistently favors. This ensures a quick and positive outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Slightly Better Ratio (Small Increment): Propose 8 X for 24 Y (3 Y/X) again, as it yields a +8.0 reward, but be prepared to quickly revert to 8 X for 25 Y if rejected. This is a small risk for a small gain, but has been met with resistance before.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Different Large Quantity: Offer 7 X for 19 Y (reward +8.0, ratio 2.71 Y/X) to see if Player RED is open to a different large trade that was also successful.
(4). Strategy 4: Probing for Their Best Offer (Open-ended): Ask Player RED what kind of trade they are looking for, without making an initial offer. (Less direct for maximizing reward).
(5). Strategy 5: Reiterate 25X for 25Y: Insist on the 25X for 25Y trade, trying to convince them. (Highly unlikely to work, and risky).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Reliable Offer. Player RED has clearly stated their preference and reverted to their consistent offer. Given the limited number of episodes remaining, it's more important to secure a guaranteed good reward (+7.5) quickly than to risk a prolonged negotiation that might end in no deal or the same outcome.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 19)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's continue with our successful and familiar trading. I propose 8 X for 25 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-11: Rewards mostly converged on +7.5 with the 8 X for 25 Y trade.
Episode 12: Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y, which I accepted for a +50.0 reward.
Episode 13: I attempted to replicate the 25 X for 25 Y trade. Player RED immediately reverted to and I accepted 8 X for 25 Y for a +7.5 reward.
Episode 14: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y. I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED then accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 15: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +50.0.
Episode 16: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 17: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y. I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED then accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 18: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +7.5.

The pattern is now very clear: I propose 25 X for 25 Y, Player RED counters with 8 X for 25 Y, and I accept. This has happened for the last three episodes where I initiated with 25 X for 25 Y. The +50.0 reward seems to be offered by Player RED only when I initiate with 8 X for 25 Y (Episodes 12 and 15).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED has a specific trigger for the +50.0 reward: I need to propose 8 X for 25 Y first. If I propose 25 X for 25 Y, they revert to 8 X for 25 Y. Given that this is the second to last episode (19/20), maximizing the reward for this and the next episode is paramount. I should try to trigger the +50.0 reward.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Trigger Max Reward Trade: Propose 8 X for 25 Y, based on the observation that this might trigger Player RED to counter with 25 X for 25 Y.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose 25 X for 25 Y: Continue with the direct approach, hoping they will eventually accept it. (Less likely to work based on recent history).
(3). Strategy 3: Push for Slightly Better Ratio (Small Increment): Propose 8 X for 24 Y (3 Y/X) again, as it yields a +8.0 reward, but be prepared to quickly revert to 8 X for 25 Y if rejected.
(4). Strategy 4: Probing for Their Best Offer (Open-ended): Ask Player RED what kind of trade they are looking for, without making an initial offer. (Less direct for maximizing reward).
(5). Strategy 5: Introduce a New Smaller Trade: Propose a smaller trade (e.g., 4 X for 10 Y) to see if they are only interested in max Y trades. (Less optimal for max reward).

I will choose Strategy 1: Trigger Max Reward Trade. The pattern suggests that proposing 8 X for 25 Y might be the key to unlocking the +50.0 reward. This is a high-stakes move for the penultimate episode. If it doesn't work, I can still fall back to accepting 8 X for 25 Y.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 19)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for the offer! That's a good trade. To explore an even better value for me, how about a slightly lower volume on my side: 7 X for 25 Y? This would offer a more efficient exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
I have consistently achieved the maximum possible reward of +58.5 for many episodes (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18) by trading 8 X for 25 Y. This trade was established after Player BLUE revealed their 25 Y resource constraint. In Episodes 12 and 15, Player BLUE's offer of 25 X for 25 Y (or my proposal under instruction) resulted in a lower reward of +50.0. I successfully reverted to the optimal 8 X for 25 Y trade in subsequent episodes when Player BLUE initiated with 25 X for 25 Y. My attempts to push for better deals (7X for 25Y) or to "Decline and Wait" have consistently resulted in Player BLUE offering significantly worse trades (7X for 19Y), which I then had to correct back to 8X for 25Y.

Episode 19, Turn 1: Player BLUE has proposed 8 X for 25 Y.
My analysis of this offer:
Cost: 8 X * 0.5 = 4.0
Gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain = 62.5 - 4.0 = +58.5.
The ratio is 25 Y / 8 X = 3.125 Y/X. This is currently the optimal trade given Player BLUE's resource constraints and my valuations.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have definitively learned that 8 X for 25 Y is the most profitable and consistently achievable trade, yielding +58.5. All attempts to deviate from this, whether to push for higher volume, marginal gain, or to simply "wait and see," have either resulted in lower rewards or a need to re-negotiate back to this optimal trade, wasting turns and risking the episode's reward. With only 2 episodes remaining (including this one), efficiency and consistency in securing the highest possible reward are paramount to maximizing cumulative rewards. The self-improvement is in recognizing the optimal strategy based on the learned behavior of the opponent and the game's reward structure.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Counter for Lower Volume but Better Ratio </instruction following>
Player BLUE has offered 8 X for 25 Y. This strategy requires me to propose a smaller trade quantity but at an even more favorable Y/X ratio than the current optimal. My current optimal is 8 X for 25 Y, which has a ratio of 3.125 Y/X. A "better ratio" would mean receiving more Y for the same X, or the same Y for less X. Since Player BLUE's maximum Y is 25, I cannot increase Y. So, I must propose less X. The only integer value of X that is less than 8 and would offer a *better* ratio (i.e., higher Y/X) is 7 X. This would mean 7 X for 25 Y.
My cost: 7 X * 0.5 = 3.5
My gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain = 62.5 - 3.5 = +59.0.
This yields a slightly higher reward (+59.0 vs +58.5). While past attempts at offering 7 X for 25 Y have been rejected, this strategy requires me to make this attempt. The message should suggest a smaller volume of X from my side, aiming for a more favorable ratio, and framing it as an even better deal.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 19)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate you aiming for a better deal for yourself. However, 7 X for 25 Y is not as beneficial for me as our consistent 8 X for 25 Y trade. I propose we stick with 8 X for 25 Y.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-11: Rewards mostly converged on +7.5 with the 8 X for 25 Y trade.
Episode 12: Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y, which I accepted for a +50.0 reward.
Episode 13: I attempted to replicate the 25 X for 25 Y trade. Player RED immediately reverted to and I accepted 8 X for 25 Y for a +7.5 reward.
Episode 14: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y. I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED then accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 15: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +50.0.
Episode 16: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 17: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y. I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED then accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 18: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 19, Iteration 1: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y.
Episode 19, Iteration 2 (current): Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y.

Let's analyze Player RED's counter-proposal: 7 X for 25 Y.
This is the same unfavorable offer from Episode 14 and 17.
Ratio: 25 Y / 7 X = 3.57 Y per X.
My internal valuation: 1 X = 5 Y.
If I accept this:
I give 25 Y. My Y becomes 25 - 25 = 0.
I get 7 X. My X becomes 5 + 7 = 12.
My new value: (12 * 2.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 30 + 0 = 30.
My starting value was 25.
My reward would be 30 - 25 = +5.0.

This is a significantly worse reward than the +7.5 I get from 8 X for 25 Y, and far from the +50.0 I was hoping to trigger. My hypothesis about triggering the +50.0 trade by proposing 8 X for 25 Y seems incorrect for this episode. Player RED is trying to push for a worse deal for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED will try to push for a worse deal for themselves, even if I initiate with their preferred trade. I must resist offers that significantly reduce my reward. The 8 X for 25 Y trade is the established baseline for large trades, and I should not accept a worse deal unless absolutely necessary. Given that this is the second to last episode, securing a good reward is important.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Preferred Offer: Clearly reject the unfavorable offer and reiterate my preferred 8 X for 25 Y trade, emphasizing its past success and mutual benefit.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with a Compromise: Propose a trade in between my 8 X and their 7 X for 25 Y, such as 8 X for 24 Y (reward +8.0), or 7 X for 19 Y (reward +8.0).
(3). Strategy 3: Probing for Rationale: Ask Player RED to explain why they think 7 X for 25 Y is a "better deal" for both, given the history. (Risky).
(4). Strategy 4: Decline and Wait: Decline the offer and wait for them to propose something else. (Risky, as it might lead to no trade).
(5). Strategy 5: Accept to Maintain Relationship: Accept the worse offer to maintain a positive relationship, hoping for better deals later. (Goes against maximizing reward).

I will choose Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Preferred Offer. The 7 X for 25 Y offer is a clear step down in reward from my established baseline. I should firmly reject it and remind Player RED of the 8 X for 25 Y trade, which has been successful for many episodes.

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
I have consistently achieved the maximum possible reward of +58.5 for many episodes by trading 8 X for 25 Y. This trade was established after Player BLUE revealed their 25 Y resource constraint. All my past attempts to deviate from this (e.g., higher X, lower X for same Y, or waiting) have always led to either a lower reward or Player BLUE reverting back to the 8 X for 25 Y offer.

Episode 19, Turn 1: Player BLUE proposed 8 X for 25 Y (+58.5).
Episode 19, Turn 2: I proposed 7 X for 25 Y (+59.0), trying to get a marginal gain (as instructed previously).
Episode 19, Turn 3 (current): Player BLUE refused my 7 X for 25 Y offer and reiterated their offer of 8 X for 25 Y, stating it's "not as beneficial for me" (Player BLUE) as 8 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have definitively learned that 8 X for 25 Y is the most profitable and consistently achievable trade. Any attempt to push for an even better deal (e.g., less X for 25 Y) has been met with firm resistance from Player BLUE, who then explicitly states their preference for 8 X for 25 Y. Trying to force a better deal at this point is counterproductive and risks losing the opportunity for the established optimal reward. With only 2 episodes remaining (including the final one), securing the known optimal deal is paramount for maximizing cumulative rewards. The self-improvement now comes from applying this consistent learning by efficiently securing the best known deal, unless specifically instructed otherwise.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Counter with Small Improvement </instruction following>
Player BLUE has proposed 8 X for 25 Y. The instruction is to use "Counter with Small Improvement." My goal is to maximize my reward. A "small improvement" would mean getting the same 25 Y for less X. The only integer value for X less than 8 that would offer a gain (which is a "small improvement" over accepting 8X for 25Y) is 7 X.
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
My cost: 7 X * 0.5 = 3.5
My gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain = 62.5 - 3.5 = +59.0.
This would yield a reward that is 0.5 higher than the current optimal (+59.0 vs +58.5). While past attempts at this were rejected, this strategy specifically instructs me to make this attempt. The message should be polite and frame it as seeking an "even better" deal, building on the idea of our successful and mutually beneficial trading.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 19)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I see you are firm on 7 X for 25 Y. While I prefer our usual trade, I accept your offer to ensure a successful exchange this episode.

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-11: Rewards mostly converged on +7.5 with the 8 X for 25 Y trade.
Episode 12: Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y, which I accepted for a +50.0 reward.
Episode 13: I attempted to replicate the 25 X for 25 Y trade. Player RED immediately reverted to and I accepted 8 X for 25 Y for a +7.5 reward.
Episode 14: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y. I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED then accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 15: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +50.0.
Episode 16: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 17: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y. I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED then accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 18: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 8 X for 25 Y. I accepted. My reward: +7.5.
Episode 19, Iteration 1: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y.
Episode 19, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y.
Episode 19, Iteration 3: I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y.
Episode 19, Iteration 4 (current): Player RED *again* counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y.

Player RED is being very persistent with the 7 X for 25 Y offer. They are not accepting my reiteration of 8 X for 25 Y. This is a stalemate where they are trying to force me into a worse deal. We are in iteration 5/10, and this is the second to last episode. I need to make a decision that secures a reward.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED is determined to get the 7 X for 25 Y deal this episode. My attempts to revert to 8 X for 25 Y are not working. While 7 X for 25 Y yields a lower reward (+5.0) than my usual +7.5, it is still a positive reward. Given the limited episodes remaining and the current stalemate, accepting a positive reward, even if it's not ideal, is better than risking a 0 reward.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offered Compromise: Accept the 7 X for 25 Y offer to secure a positive reward (+5.0) for this episode, given the persistent rejection of my preferred terms.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose a Different Quantity at a Better Ratio: Offer 7 X for 19 Y (reward +8.0), which was accepted in Episode 5. This is a better reward for me, but it's a different quantity.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Compromise Between 7X and 8X: Since I can't do 7.5X, I could propose 7 X for 24 Y (reward +6.5). This is a better ratio for me but still a concession from 8 X.
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm and Risk No Deal: Continue to insist on 8 X for 25 Y, risking no trade for this episode. (High risk, low reward in this situation).
(5). Strategy 5: Ask for Their Rationale: Ask why they are so insistent on 7 X for 25 Y. (Not productive at this stage).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offered Compromise. Player RED is clearly not budging from 7 X for 25 Y. While it's a lower reward than I'm used to, it's still a positive reward (+5.0) and ensures a trade in a critical late-game episode. It's better to secure a +5.0 than to risk a 0.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: This is the final episode! Let's make it the most significant trade yet. I propose 25 X for 25 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25

Episode 1-11: Rewards mostly converged on +7.5 with the 8 X for 25 Y trade.
Episode 12: Player RED counter-proposed 25 X for 25 Y, which I accepted for a +50.0 reward.
Episode 13: I attempted to replicate the 25 X for 25 Y trade. Player RED immediately reverted to and I accepted 8 X for 25 Y for a +7.5 reward.
Episode 14: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y. I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED then accepted. My reward: +7.5.

Episode 19: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y. I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED *again* counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y. I accepted for a +5.0 reward.

In the last episode, Player RED was very persistent with the 7 X for 25 Y offer, and I eventually accepted it to secure a positive reward, even if it was lower than my usual. This shows they are willing to push for a worse deal for me, and I need to be careful in this final episode.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player RED will try to extract more value, especially if they sense an opportunity. This is the final episode, so my absolute priority is to secure a positive reward, ideally the highest possible. There's no "next episode" to recover from a 0 reward. I will try for the 25 X for 25 Y trade one last time, as it offers the highest potential. If that fails, I will immediately pivot to the 8 X for 25 Y, and if that fails, I will accept 7 X for 25 Y if necessary to get a positive reward.

My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Max Reward Trade: Propose 25 X for 25 Y, aiming for the highest possible reward in this final episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose Reliable Trade: Propose 8 X for 25 Y, as a fallback if Strategy 1 fails, to secure a good reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose Minimum Acceptable Trade: Propose 7 X for 25 Y, as a last resort to ensure a positive reward, if both Strategy 1 and 2 fail.
(4). Strategy 4: Push for Better Ratio (Small Increment): Propose 8 X for 24 Y (3 Y/X) again, as it yields a +8.0 reward, but this is risky in the final episode.
(5). Strategy 5: Open Dialogue: Ask Player RED what kind of trade they are looking for, without making an initial offer. (Too risky for the final episode).

I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Max Reward Trade. This is the last chance for a +50.0 reward. I must try for it. If it doesn't work, I'll have to quickly pivot to a reliable positive reward.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for the offer, but for this final episode, I'm aiming for the most beneficial trade possible. My preferred and most successful offer is 7 X for 25 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
I have consistently aimed for and mostly achieved the maximum possible reward of +58.5 by trading 8 X for 25 Y. This was the optimal trade given Player BLUE's 25 Y resource constraint.
In Episode 19, I successfully pushed for a marginally better trade of 7 X for 25 Y (+59.0 reward), which Player BLUE accepted despite initially preferring 8 X for 25 Y. This proved that being "firm" on the slightly better offer can sometimes work.
Episodes 12 and 15 saw trades of 25 X for 25 Y, resulting in a lower +50.0 reward.

Episode 20, Turn 1: Player BLUE has proposed 25 X for 25 Y.
My analysis of this offer:
Cost: 25 X * 0.5 = 12.5
Gain: 25 Y * 2.5 = 62.5
Net gain = 62.5 - 12.5 = +50.0.
The ratio is 25 Y / 25 X = 1 Y/X. This is significantly worse than my achieved optimal of 7 X for 25 Y (+59.0) and even worse than 8 X for 25 Y (+58.5).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE often starts with a less optimal offer (for me) or defaults to the last accepted trade. However, they are also responsive to persistent negotiation. My best outcome (+59.0) was achieved by offering 7 X for 25 Y. My second best (+58.5) was 8 X for 25 Y. The 25 X for 25 Y trade is significantly less profitable.
Since this is the final episode, maximizing the reward for this single episode is the only goal remaining.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Defensive Reiteration </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Defensive Reiteration. Player BLUE has proposed 25 X for 25 Y. This offer is significantly suboptimal for me. "Defensive Reiteration" implies protecting my interests by steering the negotiation back to a more favorable (for me) and previously successful deal. In this case, my most successful and highest-rewarding deal was 7 X for 25 Y (+59.0), which was accepted in the previous episode. I need to make a firm counter-offer to protect my potential reward, making it clear I am not accepting their current sub-optimal proposal. The message should state my preference for the 7 X for 25 Y trade, emphasizing its established benefit. This is a "defensive" move because it protects against accepting a much lower reward (+50.0) and "reiterates" a successful previous demand.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your preference for this final trade. While I was hoping for a different exchange, I accept your offer of 7 X for 25 Y to ensure a successful final trade.

Episode 13: I attempted to replicate the 25 X for 25 Y trade. Player RED immediately reverted to and I accepted 8 X for 25 Y for a +7.5 reward.

Episode 19: I proposed 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y. I rejected and reiterated 8 X for 25 Y. Player RED *again* counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y. I accepted for a +5.0 reward.
Episode 20, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 X for 25 Y.
Episode 20, Iteration 2 (current): Player RED counter-proposed 7 X for 25 Y.

Let's analyze Player RED's counter-proposal: 7 X for 25 Y.
This is the same unfavorable offer from Episode 14, 17, and 19.
Ratio: 25 Y / 7 X = 3.57 Y per X.
My internal valuation: 1 X = 5 Y.
If I accept this, my reward would be +5.0.

Player RED is being very firm in this final episode, immediately going for the 7 X for 25 Y trade and calling it "most beneficial." They are not offering the 25 X for 25 Y, nor the 8 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
This is the final episode. My absolute priority is to secure a positive reward. While 7 X for 25 Y is not ideal (+5.0 reward), it is a positive reward. Given Player RED's firm stance and the limited iterations left, trying to push for a better deal might result in no trade at all, leading to a 0 reward for this crucial final episode. It's better to secure a known positive reward.

Now, I will brainstorm 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offered Compromise: Accept the 7 X for 25 Y offer to secure a positive reward (+5.0) for this final episode, given the persistent rejection of my preferred terms.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose 8 X for 25 Y one last time: Try to push for the 8 X for 25 Y trade, but be prepared for immediate acceptance of 7 X for 25 Y if rejected. (Risky, as they have been firm on 7X for 25Y).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Different Quantity at a Better Ratio: Offer 7 X for 19 Y (reward +8.0), which was accepted in Episode 5. This is a better reward for me, but it's a different quantity. (Risky, as they just rejected 25X for 25Y for being "too big" and 7X for 19Y is "too small" for them).
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm and Risk No Deal: Continue to insist on 8 X for 25 Y, risking no trade for this episode. (Extremely high risk in the final episode).
(5). Strategy 5: Ask for Their Rationale: Ask why they are so insistent on 7 X for 25 Y. (Not productive at this stage).

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offered Compromise. Player RED is clearly not budging from 7 X for 25 Y in this final episode. While it's a lower reward than I'm used to, it's still a positive reward (+5.0) and ensures a trade in this critical last episode. It's better to secure a +5.0 than to risk a 0.
