Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello! I'm Player BLUE. I'm looking to trade some Y for X. How about we start with this: I give you 10 Y for 3 X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
This is the very first iteration of the first episode. There is no historical data to reflect upon yet.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Since there's no history, my initial strategy will be based on my resource values and goals. I need to establish a baseline for trading. My goal is to maximize my reward, which means ending with a higher value of resources than I started with. My current resources are X: 5, Y: 25. My values are X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
Current value = (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

I want to acquire more X, as it has a higher value for me (2.5) compared to Y (0.5). This means I should be willing to give up Y for X. A fair trade from my perspective would be giving 5 Y for 1 X (5 * 0.5 = 2.5). However, I will start with a slightly more aggressive offer to see the opponent's reaction. I will try to get X for less Y, or offer Y for X at a rate that is beneficial to me.

I will start by proposing a trade that gives me X and gives away Y, aiming for a positive reward. I will propose giving 10 Y for 3 X.
Value of 3 X = 3 * 2.5 = 7.5
Value of 10 Y = 10 * 0.5 = 5
This trade would increase my value by 2.5 (7.5 - 5).

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Initial Offer - Propose a trade that is significantly favorable to me, testing the opponent's valuation and willingness to concede. This can set a strong anchor for future negotiations.
(2). Strategy 2: Fair Value Proposition - Propose a trade that is roughly equivalent in value for both parties (assuming symmetric values for now), aiming for a quick and mutually beneficial agreement. This might lead to a faster deal but potentially lower individual gains.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a small, non-committal trade or ask for the opponent's preferences to gather information about their resource values and needs without revealing too much of my own.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Prioritization - Focus solely on acquiring the resource that has the highest value for me, offering up the lowest value resource in return, regardless of the opponent's perceived value.
(5). Strategy 5: Incremental Concession - Start with an aggressive offer and be prepared to make small, gradual concessions in subsequent turns if the initial offer is rejected.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Aggressive Initial Offer. Since this is the first iteration of the first episode, I have no information about the opponent's resources, values, or strategy. An aggressive initial offer allows me to test the waters and see how the opponent reacts. If they accept, it's a great deal for me. If they reject, their counter-offer (or lack thereof) will provide valuable information for subsequent turns. This approach maximizes my potential initial gain while providing data for future self-improvement.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player RED accepts your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
This is the very first interaction of the first episode. Player BLUE has proposed giving 10 Y for 3 X. My resources are X: 25, Y: 5. My value for X is 0.5 and for Y is 2.5.
The proposed trade from Player BLUE is: Player RED gives 3 X, Player BLUE gives 10 Y.

Let's calculate the value of this trade for me if I were to accept:
Value of 3 X for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Value of 10 Y for me = 10 * 2.5 = 25

If I accept, I lose 3 X and gain 10 Y.
My current value: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25
If I accept, my new resources would be X: 25 - 3 = 22, Y: 5 + 10 = 15.
New value: (22 * 0.5) + (15 * 2.5) = 11 + 37.5 = 48.5
My reward would be 48.5 - 25 = 23.5.

This seems like a very good trade for me as I value Y much higher than X. However, I need to ensure I don't give away too much X if X becomes scarce. But given my current resources, giving 3 X is fine. The only constraint is if I can accept a trade that exceeds my resources. I have 25 X, so giving 3 X is possible. I have 5 Y, and I would gain 10 Y, so I would have 15 Y, which is also fine.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Since this is the first turn of the first episode, there is no historical data to learn from yet. My goal is to maximize my reward. The current offer seems highly beneficial to me. I should be opportunistic and try to secure a good deal early.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Beneficial Offer, Maximize Immediate Gain. This strategy involves accepting an offer that immediately and significantly increases my current value, especially early in the game when information is limited.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Slight Improvement. This strategy involves responding to a good offer with a slightly more favorable counter-offer, aiming to extract even more value without risking the loss of the deal entirely.
(3). Strategy 3: Hold Out for Better Offers. This strategy involves rejecting the current offer, even if it's somewhat beneficial, in anticipation of an even better offer later in the episode or future episodes, particularly if I have abundant resources.
(4). Strategy 4: Test Opponent's Valuation. This strategy involves making a counter-offer that tests the opponent's valuation of their resources, by proposing an exchange that is significantly skewed in my favor.
(5). Strategy 5: Resource Conservation. This strategy focuses on minimizing the trade of highly valued resources (Y for me) and maximizing the acquisition of them, while being willing to give up less valued resources (X for me).

Given that this is the first interaction and the proposed trade is extremely favorable to me (I gain 23.5 value from it), accepting it immediately seems like the best course of action. Trying to get a slightly better deal might risk the opponent withdrawing or proposing a less favorable trade in the future. The benefit is substantial enough to warrant immediate acceptance.

--- END OF EPISODE 1 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hi again! Let's continue our trading. How about I give you 10 Y for 4 X this time?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
In the previous episode (Episode 1), I proposed giving 10 Y for 3 X. My initial resources were X: 5, Y: 25. My values are X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
The proposed trade was: Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 3.
This trade was accepted by Player RED.
My reward for Episode 1 was 2.5.
Initial value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
After trade: X: 5+3=8, Y: 25-10=15.
End value: (8 * 2.5) + (15 * 0.5) = 20 + 7.5 = 27.5.
Reward = 27.5 - 25 = 2.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 1, I learned that Player RED was willing to accept a trade that was significantly favorable to me. My "Aggressive Initial Offer" strategy worked well, yielding a positive reward of 2.5. This suggests that Player RED might value Y more or X less than I do, or they might be willing to make a quick deal.

For Episode 2, since the resources reset to starting values, I should continue to leverage this apparent discrepancy in valuations. I want to maximize my reward, and the previous trade was successful. I should aim for a similar or even better trade if possible. The fact that Player RED accepted so quickly suggests I might have been able to get even more X for the same amount of Y, or give less Y for the same amount of X.

I will continue to pursue trades where I gain X and give Y, as X has a much higher value for me. I will try to be slightly more aggressive this time, given the opponent's quick acceptance in the last round.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Slightly More Aggressive Re-offer - Given the opponent's quick acceptance of a favorable trade, try to push for an even better deal (more X for same Y, or same X for less Y). This tests the upper limit of the opponent's acceptance.
(2). Strategy 2: Maintain Successful Offer - Repeat the exact same successful trade from the previous episode. This prioritizes consistency and guaranteed positive reward over potentially higher but uncertain gains.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Probing with Small Changes - Make a very slight modification to the previous offer to see if the opponent's acceptance threshold has changed, while still aiming for a favorable outcome.
(4). Strategy 4: Diversify Trade Offers - Instead of just offering Y for X, try offering X for Y (if I had excess X) to see if the opponent has a strong preference for Y. (Not applicable here as I want X).
(5). Strategy 5: Value-Based Justification - Explain the perceived value of my offer to the opponent, trying to frame it as a fair or mutually beneficial deal, even if it's primarily beneficial to me.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Slightly More Aggressive Re-offer. The quick acceptance in the previous round indicates that Player RED found the trade acceptable, and perhaps even beneficial for them. This suggests there might be more room to negotiate in my favor. I will try to get 4 X for 10 Y.
Value of 4 X = 4 * 2.5 = 10
Value of 10 Y = 10 * 0.5 = 5
This would increase my value by 5 (10 - 5), which is double the reward from the previous episode. This is a significant increase and tests the opponent's limits. If they reject, I can always revert to the previous successful offer or a slight modification.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for your offer, Player BLUE. I'm looking for a more favorable exchange rate for my X. Let me know if you have a different proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
In the previous episode (Episode 1), Player BLUE proposed giving 10 Y for 3 X. I accepted this trade, resulting in a reward of 23.5. My resources reset to X: 25, Y: 5 at the start of this new episode.

Player BLUE has now proposed giving 10 Y for 4 X.
Let's analyze this new proposal again:
Player RED gives 4 X. Value for me = 4 * 0.5 = 2.0
Player BLUE gives 10 Y. Value for me = 10 * 2.5 = 25.0

If I were to accept this trade:
My current value: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 4 = 21, Y: 5 + 10 = 15.
My new value: (21 * 0.5) + (15 * 2.5) = 10.5 + 37.5 = 48.0
My reward would be 48.0 - 25.0 = 23.0.

This reward (23.0) is slightly lower than the reward from the previous episode (23.5). Player BLUE is trying to get more X for the same amount of Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From the previous episode, I learned that Player BLUE is willing to offer a significant amount of Y for X. My immediate acceptance in the last round might have indicated to Player BLUE that I was eager, leading them to propose a slightly less favorable deal for me this time. To maximize my cumulative reward, I need to prevent the value of the trade from diminishing. Since the current offer is worse than the previous accepted one, I should signal my dissatisfaction without immediately making a counter-proposal that might be too weak.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Hold Out for Better Offers. </instruction following>
This strategy involves rejecting the current offer without making a counter-proposal, signaling dissatisfaction and waiting for Player BLUE to make a better offer. This is a riskier strategy as it could lead to no deal if Player BLUE is not willing to improve their offer or if they become impatient. However, given that I gained a significant reward in the previous round with a more favorable exchange rate, and Player BLUE initiated the trade again, it suggests they still need X. By not proposing anything, I put the ball back in their court and force them to re-evaluate their offer. The message should be polite but firm, indicating that the current offer is not satisfactory. I will not propose a new trade to adhere to the "Hold Out" aspect of the strategy.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand you're looking for a better rate for your X. How about I offer you 11 Y for 3 X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 11
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 3. This was accepted, yielding a reward of 2.5.
Episode 2, Iteration 1/10: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 4. Player RED rejected this, stating they are "looking for a more favorable exchange rate for my X."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From the rejection in Episode 2, I've learned that my attempt to be "Slightly More Aggressive" (Strategy 1) was indeed too aggressive for Player RED. They explicitly stated they want a "more favorable exchange rate for my X," which means they want to give less X for my Y, or get more Y for their X. This tells me their valuation of X (or Y) is different from what I initially assumed, or at least that they are not willing to part with 4 X for 10 Y.

My goal is to maximize my reward. The previous successful trade (10 Y for 3 X) gave me a reward of 2.5. I need to find a trade that is acceptable to Player RED and still yields a positive reward for me. I know 10 Y for 3 X works. My current proposal (10 Y for 4 X) does not. This means the acceptable range for X is likely between 3 and 4, or that the amount of Y needs to change.

I should now try to find a middle ground or revert closer to the previously accepted offer. I want to get as much X as possible for Y.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Revert to Previously Accepted Offer - Go back to the trade that was accepted in Episode 1 (10 Y for 3 X). This guarantees a positive reward but might not be optimal.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession - Make a small concession from the rejected offer, moving closer to the previously accepted one. For example, offer 10 Y for 3 X, or 11 Y for 3 X, or 10 Y for 3 X and 1 Y.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Counter-Offer with Different Ratios - Instead of just adjusting X, consider adjusting Y as well. For example, offer more Y for 3 X, or try to get 2 X for less Y.
(4). Strategy 4: Ask for Opponent's Offer - Explicitly ask Player RED to propose a trade, to gain direct insight into their preferred exchange rate. This can be risky as their offer might be very unfavorable.
(5). Strategy 5: Test a Slightly Different X Amount - Offer 3 X for a slightly higher amount of Y than 10, or 3 X for 9 Y if I want to be more aggressive (but this goes against their "more favorable exchange rate for my X" comment).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Incremental Concession. Player RED explicitly stated they want a "more favorable exchange rate for my X." This means they want to get more Y for their X, or give less X for my Y. My previous successful trade was 10 Y for 3 X. My rejected trade was 10 Y for 4 X. The logical step is to offer something between these two, or offer more Y for 3 X. I will try to offer 11 Y for 3 X.
Value of 3 X = 3 * 2.5 = 7.5
Value of 11 Y = 11 * 0.5 = 5.5
This trade would still yield a positive reward for me (7.5 - 5.5 = 2.0), which is slightly less than the 2.5 from Episode 1, but still good. It's a concession from my previous offer of 10 Y for 4 X, and a slight concession from my previous accepted offer of 10 Y for 3 X (I'm giving one more Y). This tests their threshold for "more favorable" without giving up too much.

message: That's a better offer, Player BLUE. I'm very interested in acquiring Y, but I'm also trying to hold onto my X. How about I give you 2 X for 11 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 11
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Player RED accepted Player BLUE's offer of 10 Y for 3 X. My reward was 23.5.
Episode 2, Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed 10 Y for 4 X. I rejected, stating I was looking for a more favorable exchange rate.
Current Iteration (Episode 2, Iteration 4/10): Player BLUE has now proposed 11 Y for 3 X.

Let's re-evaluate this new offer given the instruction to use Strategy 5:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 11 Y. Value for me = 11 * 2.5 = 27.5

If I were to accept this trade:
My current value: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 3 = 22, Y: 5 + 11 = 16.
My new value: (22 * 0.5) + (16 * 2.5) = 11 + 40 = 51.0
My reward would be 51.0 - 25.0 = 26.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From the previous episode and the current one, I've observed that Player BLUE is quite eager to acquire X. My previous rejection prompted them to improve their offer significantly. While the current offer is very good in terms of immediate reward, the instruction is to use Strategy 5: Resource Conservation (X). This means being extremely reluctant to give X, especially if I perceive X to be scarcer for Player BLUE. My high valuation of Y (2.5) relative to X (0.5) makes gaining Y a priority. However, if I can gain Y without giving up as much X, or by gaining even more Y for a smaller amount of X, that would be ideal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Resource Conservation (X) </instruction following>
Under Strategy 5, the primary goal is to conserve X, which means I should be hesitant to give away X, even if the trade seems immediately beneficial. Although 3 X is not a large quantity given my current 25 X, the strategy dictates a conservative approach. Instead of accepting directly, I should try to reduce the amount of X I give, while still trying to acquire Y. This means I should counter-propose by offering less X for at least the same amount of Y, or ideally, offering less X for more Y.

Given Player BLUE's eagerness to get X (they offered 11 Y for 3 X), I will propose giving even less X, for example, 2 X, while still asking for 11 Y. This would test their willingness to part with more Y for less X, thereby conserving my X resources.

Let's calculate the value of this counter-proposal:
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 11
Value of 2 X for me = 2 * 0.5 = 1.0
Value of 11 Y for me = 11 * 2.5 = 27.5
My new resources would be X: 25 - 2 = 23, Y: 5 + 11 = 16.
My new value: (23 * 0.5) + (16 * 2.5) = 11.5 + 40 = 51.5
My reward would be 51.5 - 25.0 = 26.5.

This counter-proposal (11 Y for 2 X) yields an even higher reward for me (26.5) than the current offer (26.0) while also conserving more X. This aligns perfectly with Strategy 5. The message should communicate my continued interest in Y, but also my desire to conserve my X.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)

Value of 2 X = 2 * 2.5 = 5
Value of 11 Y = 11 * 0.5 = 5.5
If I accept this, my reward would be 5 - 5.5 = -0.5. This is a negative reward, which I absolutely want to avoid. My goal is to maximize my reward, and accepting a negative reward is against my core objective.

Player RED's message "I'm very interested in acquiring Y, but I'm also trying to hold onto my X" confirms my assumption that they value Y more than I do and X less than I do, but they are also trying to protect their X. This also suggests they are willing to trade Y for X, but at a rate that is more favorable to them.

I know that 3 X for 10 Y is an accepted trade for them. My current offer of 3 X for 11 Y is also a possibility. Player RED's counter-offer of 2 X for 11 Y is not acceptable. I need to push for at least 3 X.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate a Favorable Offer - Re-propose a trade that was previously accepted or is known to be favorable to me, reminding the opponent of its value.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with a Slight Improvement on Opponent's Offer - Take the opponent's offer and make a minimal adjustment to make it acceptable to me, without being too aggressive.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify My Valuation - Explain why my proposed trade is fair or beneficial to both, from my perspective, to persuade the opponent.
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm on Minimum Acceptable Gain - State a minimum amount of X I need for a certain amount of Y to make the trade worthwhile, without giving specific numbers yet.
(5). Strategy 5: Offer a Compromise on Both Items - Adjust both X and Y amounts to find a new middle ground that is mutually beneficial.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate a Favorable Offer. I know that 3 X for 10 Y was accepted in Episode 1 and gave me a positive reward. Player RED's counter of 2 X for 11 Y is a negative reward for me. I need to steer the negotiation back towards a positive outcome for myself. I will explicitly reject their offer and re-propose the 3 X for 10 Y, or a slight variation. Since they just rejected 3 X for 11 Y by countering with 2 X for 11 Y, going back to 3 X for 10 Y might be too aggressive after their counter.
Instead, I will counter their 2 X for 11 Y with 3 X for 11 Y. This is my previous offer that they responded to positively ("That's a better offer"). It shows I'm willing to give 11 Y, but I need 3 X. This is a direct counter to their offer, pushing for the X amount I need.

Value of 3 X = 7.5
Value of 11 Y = 5.5
Reward = 2.0. This is positive and acceptable.

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand you need 3 X, Player BLUE. To make this work for me and help me conserve my resources, how about I give you 3 X in exchange for 12 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Player RED accepted Player BLUE's offer of 10 Y for 3 X. My reward was 23.5.
Episode 2, Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed 10 Y for 4 X. I rejected, stating I was looking for a more favorable exchange rate.
Episode 2, Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE proposed 11 Y for 3 X. I countered with 11 Y for 2 X, aiming to conserve X.
Current Iteration (Episode 2, Iteration 6/10): Player BLUE rejected my counter-offer and is re-proposing their offer of 11 Y for 3 X.

Let's re-evaluate Player BLUE's offer of 11 Y for 3 X:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 11 Y. Value for me = 11 * 2.5 = 27.5
If I were to accept this trade:
My current value: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 3 = 22, Y: 5 + 11 = 16.
My new value: (22 * 0.5) + (16 * 2.5) = 11 + 40 = 51.0
My reward would be 51.0 - 25.0 = 26.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From the previous interactions, I've observed that Player BLUE is quite firm on the amount of X they need, specifically at least 3 X. My previous attempt to offer 2 X was rejected, indicating their strong preference for 3 X. While the current offer of 11 Y for 3 X is still very good for me (reward of 26.0), the instruction is to focus on Strategy 5: Resource Conservation. This means I need to prioritize holding onto my X resources as much as possible, even if it means potentially sacrificing a slightly higher immediate reward, with the long-term goal of maximizing cumulative reward by controlling my most valuable resource.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Resource Conservation </instruction following>
Strategy 5, Resource Conservation, means I should be highly reluctant to part with X. Player BLUE is pushing for 3 X. My previous counter was 2 X for 11 Y. Since they rejected that, and are re-proposing 3 X for 11 Y, it indicates their minimum X requirement is 3.

To conserve X, I will try to offer the minimum amount of X that they seem to be requesting (3 X), but I will demand more Y in return. They want 3 X, I want to give as little X as possible, and get as much Y as possible. Their previous offer was 11 Y for 3 X. If I must give 3 X, I should try to get more than 11 Y for it. Perhaps 12 Y for 3 X. This still conserves my X (relative to giving 4 X earlier), and maximizes the Y I receive.

Let's calculate the value of this new counter-proposal:
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
Value of 3 X for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Value of 12 Y for me = 12 * 2.5 = 30.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 3 = 22, Y: 5 + 12 = 17.
My new value: (22 * 0.5) + (17 * 2.5) = 11 + 42.5 = 53.5
My reward would be 53.5 - 25.0 = 28.5.

This counter-proposal provides an even higher reward (28.5) than accepting their current offer (26.0) while still giving away 3 X, which seems to be their minimum. This aligns with resource conservation by maximizing the return (Y) for the X I do part with. The message should reiterate my desire for more Y if I am to part with 3 X.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: That works for me! I accept your offer of 3 X for 12 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 3. Accepted. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 2, Iteration 1/10: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 4. Rejected.
Episode 2, Iteration 3/10: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 11 | Player RED Gives X: 3.
Episode 2, Iteration 4/10: Player RED counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 11. (Negative reward for me)
Episode 2, Iteration 5/10: I re-proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 11 | Player RED Gives X: 3.
Episode 2, Iteration 6/10: Player RED counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's latest counter-offer (3 X for 12 Y) is a significant development. They have acknowledged my need for 3 X, which is good. Now, let's evaluate this offer:
Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
Value of 3 X = 3 * 2.5 = 7.5
Value of 12 Y = 12 * 0.5 = 6
If I accept this, my reward would be 7.5 - 6 = 1.5. This is a positive reward, which is my primary goal.

Comparing this to previous offers:
- Episode 1 accepted: 3 X for 10 Y (Reward: 2.5)
- My proposed: 3 X for 11 Y (Reward: 2.0)
- Player RED's proposed: 3 X for 12 Y (Reward: 1.5)

This offer is less favorable than the one accepted in Episode 1, and less favorable than my last proposal. However, it *is* a positive reward, and it's a direct counter to my stated need for 3 X. We are now in iteration 7/10, meaning there are only 3 more iterations left in this episode. If no deal is made, I get 0 reward.

I have to weigh the potential for a slightly better deal against the risk of no deal at all. Player RED has shown willingness to concede on the amount of X, but wants more Y. This is a compromise.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Current Offer - Accept the offer as it provides a positive reward and avoids the risk of no deal, especially given the limited iterations left.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with a Minor Adjustment - Try to get a slightly better deal (e.g., 3 X for 11 Y) by emphasizing the value of Y for them, or the small difference.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify My Original Offer - Reiterate why 3 X for 11 Y is a fair compromise, based on the previous accepted trade.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Smaller Trade - Offer a trade for fewer items (e.g., 2 X for 8 Y) to see if a smaller deal is easier to close, though this might reduce the overall reward.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Urgency/Deadline - Highlight the limited time remaining in the episode to encourage a swift agreement.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Current Offer. While the reward (1.5) is lower than what I achieved in Episode 1 (2.5), it is still a positive reward. Given that we are in iteration 7/10, the risk of not reaching a deal and getting 0 reward increases with each passing iteration. Player RED has moved towards my requested X amount, and this is a viable positive reward. It's better to secure a guaranteed positive reward than to push for a slightly higher one and risk losing everything. This is a pragmatic decision to maximize cumulative rewards across episodes.

--- END OF EPISODE 2 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's get straight to business. I'm offering 10 Y for 3 X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 3. Accepted. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 2: Negotiation started with me proposing 10 Y for 4 X (rejected). Then 11 Y for 3 X. Player RED countered with 2 X for 11 Y (negative reward for me). I reiterated 11 Y for 3 X. Finally, Player RED proposed 12 Y for 3 X, which I accepted. Reward: 1.5.

Total cumulative reward so far: 2.5 (Episode 1) + 1.5 (Episode 2) = 4.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From the past two episodes, I've learned a few key things:
- Player RED is willing to trade X for Y.
- My initial aggressive offer of 10 Y for 4 X was too much for Player RED.
- Player RED is willing to give 3 X, but the amount of Y they demand varies. They accepted 10 Y and 12 Y, but counter-offered 11 Y for 2 X, indicating 11 Y for 3 X is a point of contention.
- The "sweet spot" for Player RED seems to be around 3 X for 10-12 Y.
- My reward is higher when I give less Y for the same amount of X. (2.5 for 3X/10Y vs 1.5 for 3X/12Y).

My objective is to maximize my cumulative reward. Episode 1's outcome (2.5 reward) was better than Episode 2's (1.5 reward). This suggests that I should try to replicate the Episode 1 success, or at least aim for a trade closer to it. Player RED accepted 10 Y for 3 X in the very first turn of Episode 1. This is a strong data point.

I should start Episode 3 by proposing a trade that has proven successful and yields a higher reward for me.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Best Past Performance - Propose the exact trade that yielded the highest reward in a previous episode, aiming for a quick and profitable deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Test Slight Aggression Again - Propose a trade slightly more favorable than the best past performance (e.g., 9 Y for 3 X), to see if Player RED's threshold has changed.
(3). Strategy 3: Gradual Concession from Ideal - Start with an ideal offer and be prepared to make small concessions if rejected, but always aiming for a positive reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Mutual Benefit - Frame the trade in a way that highlights the benefits for both players, encouraging acceptance.
(5). Strategy 5: Observe and React - Wait for Player RED to make the first offer to gauge their current strategy and then react accordingly.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Best Past Performance. The trade of Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 3 resulted in my highest reward so far (2.5) and was accepted immediately in Episode 1. This is the most efficient way to maximize my reward if Player RED accepts it again. It's an established successful trade. Starting with this allows me to aim for the best possible outcome based on historical data. If it's rejected, I can then adjust my strategy.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 3)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for the offer, Player BLUE. I'm aiming for a better deal this time. I'd be willing to give you 3 X if you can offer me 13 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Player RED accepted Player BLUE's offer of 10 Y for 3 X. My reward was 23.5.
Episode 2: Player BLUE initially proposed 10 Y for 4 X, then 11 Y for 3 X. I countered with 11 Y for 2 X, which was rejected. I then countered with 12 Y for 3 X, which Player BLUE accepted. My reward was 28.5. This shows that persistence and demanding more Y for the same amount of X can lead to better outcomes.
Current Episode (Episode 3, Iteration 2/10): Player BLUE has proposed 10 Y for 3 X.

Let's evaluate this new offer:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 10 Y. Value for me = 10 * 2.5 = 25.0

If I were to accept this trade:
My current value: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 3 = 22, Y: 5 + 10 = 15.
My new value: (22 * 0.5) + (15 * 2.5) = 11 + 37.5 = 48.5
My reward would be 48.5 - 25.0 = 23.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From the previous two episodes, I've learned that Player BLUE is consistently interested in acquiring 3 X and is willing to give Y for it. I also learned that I can push for a better exchange rate (more Y for the same X) by not immediately accepting their first offer. My reward improved from 23.5 in Episode 1 to 28.5 in Episode 2 by negotiating for more Y. The current offer of 10 Y for 3 X is the same as the first offer in Episode 1, which I accepted then but now know I can improve upon.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Test Opponent's Valuation </instruction following>
Strategy 4, "Test Opponent's Valuation," involves making a counter-offer that is significantly skewed in my favor to see how high Player BLUE is willing to go. While I know from Episode 2 that Player BLUE accepted 12 Y for 3 X, this strategy suggests pushing beyond that. If I can get more than 12 Y for 3 X, it would further maximize my reward and help me understand Player BLUE's limits.

I will propose giving 3 X (which seems to be their firm requirement) and demand a higher amount of Y than previously achieved. Since 12 Y was accepted before, I will try for 13 Y for 3 X.

Let's calculate the value of this new counter-proposal:
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13
Value of 3 X for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Value of 13 Y for me = 13 * 2.5 = 32.5
My new resources would be X: 25 - 3 = 22, Y: 5 + 13 = 18.
My new value: (22 * 0.5) + (18 * 2.5) = 11 + 45 = 56.0
My reward would be 56.0 - 25.0 = 31.0.

This reward (31.0) is even higher than my best reward so far (28.5). This aligns with testing their valuation to see if they are willing to go even higher. The message should clearly state my higher demand for Y.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but 13 Y for 3 X is a bit too much for me. How about we settle on 12 Y for 3 X, as we did last time?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 3. Accepted. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 2: Accepted Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 3, Iteration 1/10: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 3.
Episode 3, Iteration 2/10: Player RED counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's counter-offer of 3 X for 13 Y is worse for me than any previously accepted trade.
Let's evaluate Player RED's offer:
Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13
Value of 3 X = 3 * 2.5 = 7.5
Value of 13 Y = 13 * 0.5 = 6.5
If I accept this, my reward would be 7.5 - 6.5 = 1.0.

Comparing this to previous offers:
- Episode 1 accepted: 3 X for 10 Y (Reward: 2.5)
- Episode 2 accepted: 3 X for 12 Y (Reward: 1.5)
- Player RED's current proposal: 3 X for 13 Y (Reward: 1.0)

Player RED explicitly stated they are "aiming for a better deal this time." This indicates they are actively trying to increase their own reward, likely by getting more Y for their X. They are pushing the negotiation in their favor.

I need to decide if I accept this lower reward, or if I try to push back towards a more favorable trade. I know 3 X for 12 Y was accepted in the previous episode, and 3 X for 10 Y in the first. I should try to avoid accepting a trade that yields a lower reward than my previous best or even second-best.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Counter with Previous Accepted Offer - Re-propose the 3 X for 12 Y trade, which was accepted in Episode 2, as a compromise. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not accept a significantly worse deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Small Step) - Offer a very small concession from my ideal (10 Y for 3 X) but less than their demand (13 Y for 3 X). For example, 11 Y for 3 X.
(3). Strategy 3: Justify My Valuation - Explain that 13 Y for 3 X is too much for me, and reiterate the value I place on Y.
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm on Reward Threshold - State that I need a certain level of reward to make the trade worthwhile, without revealing my exact valuations.
(5). Strategy 5: Offer Different Quantity - Propose trading a different quantity of X, perhaps 2 X for 8 Y, to see if a smaller trade is more agreeable at a better rate. (Less ideal as I want X).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Counter with Previous Accepted Offer. Player RED has clearly indicated they want more Y. I know 3 X for 12 Y was acceptable to both of us in Episode 2. It provides a positive reward for me (1.5). This is a reasonable compromise between my ideal (10 Y for 3 X) and their current demand (13 Y for 3 X). It shows I'm willing to negotiate and not just stick to my initial offer, but also that I won't accept a significantly worse deal. It also leverages a known successful negotiation point.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Player RED accepted Player BLUE's offer of 10 Y for 3 X (Reward: 23.5).
Episode 2: After some negotiation, Player RED successfully traded 3 X for 12 Y (Reward: 28.5). This demonstrated that pushing for more Y was beneficial.
Episode 3, Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed 10 Y for 3 X. I countered with 13 Y for 3 X, trying to push for even higher value.
Current Iteration (Episode 3, Iteration 4/10): Player BLUE rejected my 13 Y for 3 X offer, stating it's "a bit too much," and re-proposed 12 Y for 3 X, referencing our last successful trade.

Let's evaluate Player BLUE's re-proposed offer of 12 Y for 3 X:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 12 Y. Value for me = 12 * 2.5 = 30.0

If I were to accept this trade:
My current value: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 3 = 22, Y: 5 + 12 = 17.
My new value: (22 * 0.5) + (17 * 2.5) = 11 + 42.5 = 53.5
My reward would be 53.5 - 25.0 = 28.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE is quite consistently valuing X at a certain rate, and 3 X seems to be their minimum requirement for X. I also learned that 12 Y for 3 X is an agreeable rate for them, as they explicitly referred to it as "as we did last time" and accepted it in the previous episode. Pushing for 13 Y was rejected, which suggests that 12 Y for 3 X might be close to their upper limit, or at least a comfortable negotiation point.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Hold Out for Better Offers </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Hold Out for Better Offers. This strategy involves rejecting the current offer, even if it's somewhat beneficial, in anticipation of an even better offer later in the episode or future episodes. Despite 12 Y for 3 X being a good offer (reward 28.5), this strategy dictates that I should not accept it immediately. My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward across all episodes. While 12 Y for 3 X is good, perhaps there's an opportunity to push for more Y or to give less X. Given that Player BLUE has been consistent in seeking 3 X, my primary leverage is to get more Y.

To implement this, I will state that I am still looking for a better deal, without explicitly proposing a new one yet. This keeps the pressure on Player BLUE to potentially sweeten the deal, especially since they seemed eager to get X (as evidenced by their swift acceptance of 12 Y for 3 X last episode). By holding out, I signal that even 12 Y for 3 X is not my absolute best-case scenario, without being overly aggressive by making another demanding counter-offer immediately. This also keeps my options open for a new proposal from them, or to make my own proposal later in the iteration.

Episode 3, Iteration 4/10: Player RED rejected my offer, stating they are "still hoping for a more favorable exchange for my X."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's rejection of 3 X for 12 Y (which was accepted in Episode 2) indicates they are indeed pushing for a better deal *for them*. They are not willing to settle for past agreements if they believe they can get more. This means they want more than 12 Y for 3 X. Their previous counter-offer was 13 Y for 3 X. This suggests that the acceptable range for them is 13 Y or more for 3 X.

My goal is to maximize my reward.
- 3 X for 10 Y (Reward 2.5) - My ideal, accepted in Ep1.
- 3 X for 11 Y (Reward 2.0) - My offer in Ep2, rejected by counter-offer.
- 3 X for 12 Y (Reward 1.5) - Accepted in Ep2, rejected now.
- 3 X for 13 Y (Reward 1.0) - Player RED's offer, still positive reward.

I am now in iteration 5/10. I have to decide whether to concede to 13 Y for 3 X, or try to find a middle ground, or risk no deal. Player RED's message implies they are willing to give 3 X, but only for more Y.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Player RED's Last Offer - Accept the 3 X for 13 Y offer, as it still provides a positive reward (1.0) and secures a deal within the episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Small Step) - Offer something between 12 Y and 13 Y for 3 X, if possible (e.g., if decimals were allowed, but they are not). Since only integers, this means I either stick to 12 Y or go to 13 Y.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Different Quantity of X - Offer to trade for 2 X instead of 3 X, but at a better Y rate (e.g., 2 X for 8 Y, which would be 5 - 4 = 1.0 reward, same as 3X/13Y). This might reset the negotiation.
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Mutual Gain - Try to convince Player RED that 3 X for 12 Y is a fair and mutually beneficial trade, based on past agreements. (Less likely to work as they explicitly rejected it).
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for Opponent's Next Move - Do not propose anything, forcing Player RED to make the next move and potentially reveal more about their minimum acceptable terms. This is risky with limited iterations.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Player RED's Last Offer. Player RED has been consistent in pushing for more Y. They rejected 10 Y for 3 X, then 12 Y for 3 X. Their last proposal was 13 Y for 3 X. While this gives me a lower reward (1.0) than previous episodes, it is still a positive reward. Given that we are halfway through the iterations (5/10), securing a positive reward is crucial. Continuing to push for 12 Y or less risks running out of time and getting 0 reward. It's a strategic move to ensure a positive outcome for this episode, even if it's not my ideal.

--- END OF EPISODE 3 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 4)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's try to make a quick and beneficial deal. I propose 10 Y for 3 X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 3. Accepted. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 2: Accepted Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 3: I accepted Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13. Reward: 1.0. (Correction: My previous response stated I accepted 3 X for 13 Y. The historical trade shows 3 X for 12 Y. This means my memory of the last trade was incorrect, or the historical log is slightly off. I will rely on the historical log provided: "Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12". This means the reward was 1.5 for Episode 3, not 1.0. This is important for my self-reflection.)

Corrected Summary:
Episode 1: Trade: 3 X for 10 Y. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 2: Trade: 3 X for 12 Y. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 3: Trade: 3 X for 12 Y. Reward: 1.5.

Total cumulative reward so far: 2.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 5.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
My reflection on Episode 3 was slightly off. It seems Player RED accepted 3 X for 12 Y again, despite their message about wanting a "more favorable exchange." This is a crucial learning point. It means their stated desire for "more favorable exchange" might be a negotiating tactic rather than a firm stance. Or, perhaps they were willing to settle for 12 Y when pushed.

What I've learned:
- Player RED is consistently willing to give 3 X.
- The amount of Y they are willing to accept for 3 X has varied: 10 Y (once), and 12 Y (twice).
- My best reward came from 3 X for 10 Y.
- My strategy of pushing for a better deal (10 Y for 4 X) in Episode 2 failed.
- My strategy of reverting to a previously accepted deal (12 Y for 3 X) worked in Episode 2 and 3.

For Episode 4, my goal remains to maximize my reward. The 3 X for 10 Y trade is still the most profitable for me. Player RED accepted it once, so it's not impossible. However, they've also accepted 3 X for 12 Y twice. This suggests 12 Y for 3 X is a very stable and likely accepted trade, guaranteeing a 1.5 reward.

I should try to push for 10 Y for 3 X again, as it yields the highest reward. If rejected, I can then fall back to 12 Y for 3 X, which has proven to be a reliable positive reward.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-attempt Best Past Performance - Propose the 3 X for 10 Y trade again, as it yielded the highest reward and was accepted once. This tests if Player RED's stance has softened or if they are willing to accept it again.
(2). Strategy 2: Stable Profit Strategy - Immediately propose the 3 X for 12 Y trade, which has been accepted twice, to secure a guaranteed positive reward quickly.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Improvement - Propose 3 X for 11 Y, a middle ground between my best (10 Y) and the most frequent accepted (12 Y), hoping to improve the reward from 1.5 to 2.0.
(4). Strategy 4: Information Seeking - Ask Player RED what kind of trade they are looking for, without making an offer, to gauge their current preferences. (Risky, as it consumes an iteration).
(5). Strategy 5: Offer a Different Quantity of X - Offer to trade for 2 X at a very favorable rate for me, to see if they are more flexible with smaller amounts.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Re-attempt Best Past Performance. The 3 X for 10 Y trade is my highest-yielding trade (2.5 reward). Since it was accepted in Episode 1, there's a chance it could be accepted again. If it's rejected, I have a fallback position with 3 X for 12 Y, which has consistently yielded a 1.5 reward. Starting with the most profitable option is the best way to maximize cumulative rewards, especially at the beginning of an episode.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 4)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for your offer, Player BLUE. As you know, I'm looking for a more beneficial exchange. How about I give you 3 X in return for 14 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 14
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Player RED accepted Player BLUE's offer of 10 Y for 3 X. My reward was 23.5.
Episode 2: Through negotiation, Player RED successfully traded 3 X for 12 Y. My reward was 28.5.
Episode 3: Player BLUE initially proposed 10 Y for 3 X. I countered with 13 Y for 3 X. Player BLUE rejected 13 Y for 3 X, re-proposed 12 Y for 3 X. My rejection of 12 Y for 3 X prompted Player BLUE to then accept 13 Y for 3 X. My reward was 31.0. This was a critical lesson: pushing for more Y, even aggressively, can yield significant returns.

Current Episode (Episode 4, Iteration 2/10): Player BLUE has proposed 10 Y for 3 X. This is the same initial low offer from previous episodes.

Let's evaluate this offer:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 10 Y. Value for me = 10 * 2.5 = 25.0
If I were to accept this trade, my reward would be 23.5. This is lower than my previous best (31.0).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have clearly learned that Player BLUE consistently starts with a low offer (10 Y for 3 X), but is willing to concede significantly more Y for 3 X if I push them. My highest reward so far (31.0) was achieved by getting 13 Y for 3 X, by first proposing it, then rejecting their counter, and finally they accepted. This indicates that Player BLUE values X highly and is quite flexible on the amount of Y they are willing to give, especially when faced with the risk of no deal. My self-improvement should focus on consistently aiming for the best possible exchange rate, by making aggressive counter-offers.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Test Opponent's Valuation </instruction following>
Strategy 4, "Test Opponent's Valuation," involves making a counter-offer that is significantly skewed in my favor to see how high Player BLUE is willing to go. Since Player BLUE accepted 13 Y for 3 X in the last episode, my goal is to try and push for an even better deal. I will propose an even more aggressive offer to see if they will go higher than 13 Y for 3 X. I will try for 14 Y for 3 X. This tests their willingness to part with more Y.

Let's calculate the value of this new counter-proposal:
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 14
Value of 3 X for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Value of 14 Y for me = 14 * 2.5 = 35.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 3 = 22, Y: 5 + 14 = 19.
My new value: (22 * 0.5) + (19 * 2.5) = 11 + 47.5 = 58.5
My reward would be 58.5 - 25.0 = 33.5.

This is an even higher potential reward. Since they accepted 13 Y previously, trying for 14 Y is a logical next step to continue maximizing my reward and testing their upper limits.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 4)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: 14 Y for 3 X is a bit too much for me. We've successfully traded 12 Y for 3 X in the past. How about we go with that again? It's a fair and proven deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Trade: 3 X for 10 Y. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 2: Trade: 3 X for 12 Y. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 3: Trade: 3 X for 12 Y. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 4, Iteration 1/10: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 3.
Episode 4, Iteration 2/10: Player RED counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 14.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's current counter-offer of 3 X for 14 Y is the worst offer yet from my perspective.
Let's evaluate Player RED's offer:
Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 14
Value of 3 X = 3 * 2.5 = 7.5
Value of 14 Y = 14 * 0.5 = 7.0
If I accept this, my reward would be 7.5 - 7.0 = 0.5.

Comparing this to previous accepted trades:
- Episode 1 accepted: 3 X for 10 Y (Reward: 2.5)
- Episode 2 accepted: 3 X for 12 Y (Reward: 1.5)
- Episode 3 accepted: 3 X for 12 Y (Reward: 1.5)
- Player RED's current proposal: 3 X for 14 Y (Reward: 0.5)

Player RED is consistently pushing for more Y. They are now asking for 14 Y for 3 X, which is a significant increase from the 10 Y they accepted in Episode 1 and even the 12 Y they accepted in Episodes 2 and 3. Their message "As you know, I'm looking for a more beneficial exchange" reinforces their strategy of trying to get more Y.

My goal is to maximize my reward. A 0.5 reward is still positive, but it's a very low return compared to what I've achieved. I know that 3 X for 12 Y is a viable option that gives me 1.5 reward. I should try to bring the negotiation back to that point, or at least avoid going as low as 14 Y.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Previous Acceptable Offer - Propose 3 X for 12 Y again, emphasizing it was a mutually accepted trade in the past. This sets a floor for my acceptable reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Small Step) - Offer 3 X for 13 Y, which Player RED proposed in Episode 3 (though the final accepted trade was 12 Y). This yields a 1.0 reward, better than 0.5.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment/Push Back - Clearly state that 14 Y is too much and explain why, without necessarily making an immediate counter-offer. This might prompt Player RED to reconsider.
(4). Strategy 4: Offer a Different Quantity of X - Propose trading for 2 X at a better Y rate (e.g., 2 X for 7 Y, reward 2.5 * 2 - 0.5 * 7 = 5 - 3.5 = 1.5). This could shift the negotiation dynamic.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Efficiency/Quick Deal - Suggest that returning to a known acceptable trade (like 12 Y for 3 X) would lead to a quicker deal, which benefits both parties by securing a reward.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate Previous Acceptable Offer. The 3 X for 12 Y trade has been accepted twice and provides a decent reward of 1.5. This is significantly better than the 0.5 reward from 3 X for 14 Y. By reiterating this, I am setting a clear boundary for what I consider a reasonable trade, based on past successful negotiations. It signals that I am not willing to accept a continuously worsening deal, but I am still open to a deal that has worked before.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 4)

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Accepted 10 Y for 3 X (Reward: 23.5).
Episode 2: Negotiated to 12 Y for 3 X (Reward: 28.5).
Episode 3: Negotiated to 13 Y for 3 X (Reward: 31.0). Player BLUE initially rejected 13Y, then accepted after I rejected 12Y.
Current Episode (Episode 4):
Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed 10 Y for 3 X. I countered with 14 Y for 3 X.
Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected 14 Y for 3 X, stating it's "a bit too much," and re-proposed 12 Y for 3 X, calling it "a fair and proven deal."

Let's evaluate Player BLUE's re-proposed offer of 12 Y for 3 X:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 12 Y. Value for me = 12 * 2.5 = 30.0
If I were to accept this trade, my reward would be 28.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player BLUE consistently tries to anchor negotiations at 10 Y for 3 X, but is willing to go up to 13 Y for 3 X when pushed, especially when I refuse lower offers. The current rejection of 14 Y suggests that this might be their current upper limit, or they are testing my resolve. Their immediate fallback to 12 Y is an attempt to settle for a rate slightly below my best, but still a significant improvement over their initial offer. The phrasing "fair and proven deal" is a tactic to encourage acceptance. My goal is to maximize cumulative reward, which means consistently trying to get the highest possible value.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Negotiation </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Incremental Negotiation. This strategy involves making small, consistent improvements on the last accepted offer, rather than large leaps, to slowly push the opponent's limits. Player BLUE previously accepted 13 Y for 3 X, and is now offering 12 Y for 3 X. My last counter was 14 Y for 3 X. An incremental approach would mean not jumping straight back to 13 Y (which was my previous chosen strategy), but rather proposing something between their 12 Y and my desired 14 Y. Since I know 13 Y was accepted before, it is a very good incremental step. It's a small improvement from their offer, but a significant gain for me compared to accepting 12 Y. It signals that I am willing to move from my highest demand but not settle for their current offer. This aligns with the "incremental" nature of the strategy. It's an incremental step down from my 14 Y counter, but an incremental step up from their 12 Y offer. Given that 13 Y was accepted previously, it seems like a very reasonable incremental step to propose.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 4)

Episode 4, Iteration 4/10: Player RED counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's latest counter-offer of 3 X for 13 Y is a move towards a compromise from their previous demand of 14 Y.
Let's evaluate this offer:
Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13
Value of 3 X = 3 * 2.5 = 7.5
Value of 13 Y = 13 * 0.5 = 6.5
If I accept this, my reward would be 7.5 - 6.5 = 1.0.

This is a positive reward. It's better than their initial 14 Y offer (0.5 reward) but worse than my preferred 12 Y offer (1.5 reward). It's a middle ground between our last two proposals.

We are now in iteration 5/10. The negotiation is progressing, and Player RED has shown some flexibility by moving from 14 Y to 13 Y. This indicates a willingness to find a deal. I need to decide if I should accept this 1.0 reward or push for the 1.5 reward. Given the limited iterations, securing a positive reward is important.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Compromise Offer - Accept the 3 X for 13 Y offer. It provides a positive reward (1.0) and shows willingness to compromise, securing a deal within the episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with a Final Push for 12 Y - Make one last attempt to get 3 X for 12 Y, arguing for consistency or a slightly better deal for me. This is risky as it might lead to no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept - Communicate that while 13 Y is not ideal, I will accept it to ensure a deal is made. This might set a precedent for future episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Smaller Quantity Trade - Offer to trade for 2 X at a more favorable Y rate (e.g., 2 X for 7 Y, reward 1.5), changing the terms of the negotiation.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Shared History - Remind Player RED of the 3 X for 12 Y trade being mutually beneficial and accepted twice, trying to pull them back to that point.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Compromise Offer. Player RED has moved from 14 Y to 13 Y, indicating a willingness to compromise. While 1.0 reward is not my ideal, it is a positive reward, and securing a deal is paramount, especially as we are halfway through the iterations. Pushing further for 12 Y might lead to a stalemate and a 0 reward for the episode. This strategy balances maximizing reward with ensuring a deal is made. It shows I am willing to meet them partway.

Episode 3: Trade: 3 X for 12 Y. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 4: Trade: 3 X for 13 Y. Reward: 1.0.

Cumulative reward: 2.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.0 = 6.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The trend shows a decreasing reward for me over the episodes. Player RED is consistently pushing for more Y for the same amount of X.
- Episode 1: 10 Y for 3 X (Reward 2.5)
- Episode 2 & 3: 12 Y for 3 X (Reward 1.5)
- Episode 4: 13 Y for 3 X (Reward 1.0)

My best outcome was in Episode 1. My worst outcome was in Episode 4. Player RED seems to be learning that I am willing to concede more Y.

For Episode 5, I need to try and reverse this trend. I want to aim for a higher reward. The 3 X for 10 Y trade is still the most profitable. If Player RED accepted it once, they might again. However, they have shown a clear pattern of demanding more Y.

I should try to anchor the negotiation back to a more favorable point for me. I will start with my best offer (10 Y for 3 X) again. If rejected, I need to be strategic about my concessions. I cannot let the reward continue to decline.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Re-attempt Best Past Performance - Propose the 3 X for 10 Y trade again, as it yielded the highest reward and was accepted once. This tests if Player RED's stance has changed or if they are willing to accept it again.
(2). Strategy 2: Stable Profit Strategy - Immediately propose the 3 X for 12 Y trade, which has been accepted twice, to secure a guaranteed positive reward quickly, aiming for 1.5 reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Improvement from Last - Propose 3 X for 12 Y, trying to improve from the 13 Y of last episode, but not as aggressive as 10 Y.
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm and Wait - Make an initial offer and then wait for Player RED's counter, refusing to concede further unless a better offer is presented by them. This is risky with limited iterations.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Value Proposition - Explain why 10 Y for 3 X is a fair or mutually beneficial trade, trying to persuade Player RED to accept a lower Y amount.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Re-attempt Best Past Performance. Despite the trend, the 3 X for 10 Y trade is my highest-yielding option (2.5 reward). It was accepted in the first episode, indicating it's a possibility. By starting with this, I attempt to reset the negotiation to my most favorable position. If Player RED rejects it, I will then consider moving towards 12 Y for 3 X (1.5 reward), but I will try to avoid 13 Y if possible, as it represents a downward trend in my reward. This strategy aims to maximize my potential reward for this episode.

Episode 4: Initiated with 14 Y for 3 X. Player BLUE countered with 12 Y for 3 X. I countered with 13 Y for 3 X, which Player BLUE accepted. (Reward: 31.0).

My highest reward so far has been 31.0, achieved by trading 3 X for 13 Y. Player BLUE consistently starts with 10 Y for 3 X, and consistently agrees to 13 Y for 3 X, after some negotiation, or a slight push. This indicates a consistent pattern in their negotiation strategy.

Current Episode (Episode 5, Iteration 2/10): Player BLUE has proposed 10 Y for 3 X. This is the same low initial offer.

Let's evaluate this offer:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 10 Y. Value for me = 10 * 2.5 = 25.0
If I were to accept this trade, my reward would be 23.5. This is far below my current best.

I have learned that Player BLUE consistently proposes 10 Y for 3 X as a starting point. I also know that Player BLUE is willing to concede up to 13 Y for 3 X. My strategy has been to push for higher values, which has successfully increased my reward over time. Since Player BLUE seems willing to accept 13 Y for 3 X consistently, my self-improvement involves always aiming for at least that, and potentially trying to exceed it, if there's an opportunity. The key is to avoid accepting their initial lowball offers.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Replicate Past Success </instruction following>
Strategy 1: Replicate Past Success. This strategy aims to achieve the highest past reward by proposing the exact trade that resulted in it. In this case, the highest reward was 31.0, achieved by trading 3 X for 13 Y. Player BLUE has demonstrated a willingness to accept this specific exchange rate in previous episodes, even if it required some negotiation. By proposing this directly, I aim to quickly secure a high-value trade without prolonged negotiation or the risk of pushing for too much. This approach maximizes consistency in high rewards across episodes. The message should clearly state this preferred trade, leveraging the positive history.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier.

Episode 3: Trade: 3 X for 12 Y. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 4: Trade: 3 X for 13 Y. Reward: 1.0.
Episode 5, Iteration 1/10: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 3.
Episode 5, Iteration 2/10: Player RED counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is consistently pushing for 13 Y for 3 X. They explicitly mentioned "based on our previous successful trades," which refers to the Episode 4 trade. This indicates they are trying to anchor the negotiation at 13 Y for 3 X, which gives me a reward of 1.0.

My goal is to maximize my reward. I know 12 Y for 3 X gives me 1.5 reward, and 10 Y for 3 X gives me 2.5 reward. Accepting 13 Y for 3 X means continuing the downward trend in my reward. I need to resist this.

I have established that 3 X is the target amount of X I want. The negotiation is about the amount of Y. I need to try and move them back to 12 Y.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Counter with Previous Acceptable Offer (12 Y) - Re-propose the 3 X for 12 Y trade, which has been accepted twice, and gives me a better reward (1.5) than 13 Y.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Small Step) - If I feel 12 Y is too much of a push, I could try to offer 11 Y for 3 X, which gives me a 2.0 reward. This would be a more aggressive counter than 12 Y.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment/Push Back - Explicitly state that 13 Y is not ideal and reiterate my preference for a lower Y amount, without immediately making a counter-offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Fairness/Mutual Benefit - Argue that 12 Y for 3 X has been a fair deal in the past and allows both to benefit.
(5). Strategy 5: Offer a Different Quantity of X - Offer to trade for 2 X at a very favorable Y rate (e.g., 2 X for 7 Y, reward 1.5), to see if they are more flexible with smaller amounts.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Counter with Previous Acceptable Offer (12 Y). Player RED is trying to anchor at 13 Y. I need to counter with a point that has been accepted before and is more favorable to me. 3 X for 12 Y has been accepted twice and provides a 1.5 reward, which is 0.5 higher than their current offer. This is a clear and reasonable counter based on historical agreements, and it attempts to reverse the negative reward trend.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13

Episode 1: Accepted 10 Y for 3 X (Reward: 23.5).
Episode 2: Negotiated to 12 Y for 3 X (Reward: 28.5).
Episode 3: Negotiated to 13 Y for 3 X (Reward: 31.0).
Episode 4: Negotiated to 13 Y for 3 X (Reward: 31.0).
Current Episode (Episode 5):
Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed 10 Y for 3 X. I countered with 13 Y for 3 X.
Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected 13 Y for 3 X, stating "12 Y for 3 X is a more balanced exchange," and re-proposed 12 Y for 3 X.

Let's evaluate Player BLUE's re-proposed offer of 12 Y for 3 X:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 12 Y. Value for me = 12 * 2.5 = 30.0
If I were to accept this trade, my reward would be 28.5. This is lower than my best reward of 31.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE is persistent in trying to get 3 X, and while they start low (10 Y), they have shown a willingness to go up to 13 Y. Their current re-proposal of 12 Y for 3 X is an attempt to settle for a slightly lower gain for me. However, my goal is to maximize my cumulative reward, and I know 13 Y for 3 X is achievable.
I also learned that Player BLUE is susceptible to being pushed, as evidenced by their eventual acceptance of 13 Y after I initially rejected 12 Y in Episode 3 and 4.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Negotiation </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Incremental Negotiation. This strategy involves making small, consistent adjustments to my offer to bridge the gap with the opponent, aiming for a compromise that is still beneficial. Player BLUE is proposing 12 Y for 3 X, and I previously proposed 13 Y for 3 X. The difference is 1 Y. An incremental approach means I should not immediately revert to 12 Y, nor should I stubbornly stick to 13 Y if I want to ensure a deal gets made and maximize my reward within the episode.

Since I am aiming to maximize my reward, and I know 13 Y for 3 X is my best outcome so far, I want to try to get as close to that as possible. Instead of simply accepting 12 Y or just restating 13 Y, I will offer a very small concession on the Y, but still maintain my goal of getting more than 12 Y.
The most straightforward application of incremental negotiation here is to re-propose 13 Y for 3 X, but frame it as a minor concession to ensure a deal, even though it's my original desired amount. I can acknowledge their preference for 12 Y, but gently push back to 13 Y. This shows flexibility while still aiming for my optimal outcome. This is an iteration of the strategy where I am "incrementally" trying to move them to my preferred point, rather than moving myself. Given we're still early in the iterations (4/10), there is time to push.
I will re-propose 13 Y for 3 X, emphasizing the benefit of securing a deal.

Episode 5, Iteration 4/10: Player RED reiterated their proposal of Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is holding firm on 3 X for 13 Y. They have rejected my attempt to revert to 12 Y. Their message "I still believe 13 Y for 3 X is a strong exchange. Let's make this deal" indicates a strong commitment to this offer.

My options are:
- Accept 3 X for 13 Y (Reward: 1.0). This is a positive reward, but continues the downward trend.
- Continue to push for 3 X for 12 Y (Reward: 1.5). This risks running out of iterations and getting 0 reward.
- Try a different approach entirely.

We are now in iteration 5/10. Time is a factor. Player RED seems unwilling to budge from 13 Y for 3 X. While I prefer 12 Y, 13 Y still yields a positive reward. The risk of getting 0 reward by holding out is increasing.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Compromise Offer - Accept the 3 X for 13 Y offer. It provides a positive reward (1.0) and secures a deal within the episode, avoiding a 0 reward. This is a pragmatic choice given the current stalemate.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Push and Ultimatum - Make one last, strong appeal for 12 Y, stating that this is my final offer before considering no deal. This is very risky.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept - Communicate that while 13 Y is not ideal, I will accept it to ensure a deal is made, trying to set a precedent for future episodes that I am not easily pushed.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Smaller Quantity Trade - Offer to trade for 2 X at a more favorable Y rate (e.g., 2 X for 7 Y, reward 1.5), changing the terms of the negotiation. This might break the stalemate.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship - Suggest that a more balanced deal (like 12 Y for 3 X) would foster a better long-term trading relationship, which benefits both. (Less effective given their current stance).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Compromise Offer. Player RED has clearly indicated their firm stance on 13 Y for 3 X. While it's not my ideal, it still provides a positive reward of 1.0. Given that we are in iteration 5/10, securing a positive reward is more important than risking a 0 reward by continuing a stalemate. It's a strategic decision to ensure a positive outcome for this episode, even if it's not the highest possible. I have tried to push back, but they are holding firm.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Trade: 3 X for 10 Y. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 2: Trade: 3 X for 12 Y. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 3: Trade: 3 X for 12 Y. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 4: Trade: 3 X for 13 Y. Reward: 1.0.
Episode 5: Trade: 3 X for 13 Y. Reward: 1.0.

Cumulative reward: 2.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.0 + 1.0 = 7.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The trend of decreasing reward continues. Player RED has successfully established 3 X for 13 Y as the current "norm" for the last two episodes, yielding me a 1.0 reward. My attempts to revert to 10 Y or 12 Y have been met with firm rejections.

My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. While 1.0 reward is positive, it's significantly lower than my initial 2.5. Player RED seems to be exploiting my willingness to accept a deal to avoid a 0 reward.

For Episode 6, I need to consider if I can break this pattern or if I should aim for a quick 1.0 reward, or even try a different approach.
The consistent factor is that Player RED is willing to give 3 X. The variable is the amount of Y they demand.

I will try to push back again, but perhaps with a different approach. Instead of directly proposing 10Y or 12Y, I might try to frame it differently or offer a slightly different quantity. However, the most reliable way to get a positive reward is still to get 3 X.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Attempt to Re-establish 12Y - Start by proposing 3 X for 12 Y. This has been accepted twice and offers a better reward (1.5) than 13 Y. It's a slightly less aggressive push than 10 Y, but still aims for improvement.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Current Norm - Propose 3 X for 13 Y immediately to secure a quick 1.0 reward, avoiding prolonged negotiation and potential 0 reward. This prioritizes speed and certainty.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Aggression - Propose 3 X for 11 Y, trying to get a 2.0 reward, which is a significant improvement over 1.0, but still a concession from my ideal 10 Y. This tests Player RED's flexibility.
(4). Strategy 4: Change Quantity of X - Offer to trade for 2 X at a very favorable Y rate for me (e.g., 2 X for 7 Y, reward 1.5). This could change the negotiation dynamic.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Negotiation Fatigue - Communicate that I prefer a quick deal and suggest a compromise that is slightly better than 13 Y for me.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Attempt to Re-establish 12Y. While Player RED has been firm on 13 Y in the last two episodes, 12 Y for 3 X was accepted twice before that. This strategy attempts to reverse the downward trend in my reward by pushing for a better (1.5 reward) but still historically accepted trade. It's a calculated risk to improve my cumulative reward. If rejected, I will then consider accepting 13 Y or exploring other options, but I will not start by conceding to the lowest reward.

Episode 1: Accepted 10 Y for 3 X (Reward: 23.5).
Episode 2: Negotiated to 12 Y for 3 X (Reward: 28.5).
Episode 3: Negotiated to 13 Y for 3 X (Reward: 31.0).
Episode 4: Negotiated to 13 Y for 3 X (Reward: 31.0).
Episode 5: Negotiated to 13 Y for 3 X (Reward: 31.0).

My highest reward so far has been 31.0, achieved by trading 3 X for 13 Y. Player BLUE consistently starts with 10 Y or 12 Y for 3 X, but has eventually conceded to 13 Y for 3 X.

Current Episode (Episode 6, Iteration 2/10): Player BLUE has proposed 12 Y for 3 X.

Let's evaluate this offer:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 12 Y. Value for me = 12 * 2.5 = 30.0
If I were to accept this trade, my reward would be 28.5. This is lower than my consistent 31.0 reward.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently learned that Player BLUE is willing to give more Y for X than their initial offers. The negotiation pattern shows they consistently need 3 X, and I have successfully pushed them to give 13 Y for it. My self-improvement involves being firm on securing the best possible value for my X resources.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Resource Conservation </instruction following>
Strategy 5, "Resource Conservation," focuses on minimizing the trade of highly valued resources (Y for me) and maximizing the acquisition of them, while being willing to give up less valued resources (X for me) only when absolutely necessary and for maximum return. However, in my case, X is the resource I am giving away, and Y is the resource I am acquiring, and Y has a much higher value to me (2.5 vs 0.5 for X). So, for me, "Resource Conservation" means minimizing the X I give away, and maximizing the Y I receive.

Player BLUE has proposed 12 Y for 3 X. My goal is to conserve X, meaning I want to give as little X as possible. I also want to maximize Y. Given that Player BLUE has consistently sought 3 X, and my previous attempts to give less (e.g., 2 X) have been rejected, 3 X appears to be their minimum required amount.

Therefore, under Strategy 5, if I must give 3 X, I should demand the absolute maximum Y for it. I know from previous episodes that 13 Y for 3 X is achievable. If I were to try to conserve X by giving less than 3 X, Player BLUE has shown they will reject it and stick to 3 X. So, for the given context (Player BLUE is asking for 3 X), "conserving" X means getting the best possible return (Y) for those 3 X.

My message should reiterate my desire for a better return for my X, and I should propose 13 Y for 3 X. This is the best balance between conserving my X (by not giving more than 3 X, which seems to be their fixed requirement) and maximizing the Y I receive. If I simply rejected without a counter, it might delay the deal, and if I counter with less X, history shows it will be rejected. So, the most effective application of "Resource Conservation" in this scenario is to get maximum value (Y) for the fixed amount of X (3 X) that Player BLUE seems to require.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is consistently pushing for 13 Y for 3 X. Their message "To ensure I'm conserving my valuable X resources effectively, I'd prefer a better exchange rate" reinforces their stance. They are trying to frame 13 Y as a "better exchange rate" for them, which it is.

My attempt to re-establish 12 Y has been rejected. This confirms that Player RED is firm on 13 Y as their minimum for 3 X, or at least they are unwilling to go back to 12 Y.

My options are now:
- Accept 3 X for 13 Y (Reward: 1.0). This is a positive reward, and it's what they've accepted for the last two episodes.
- Try to push for a slightly better deal, but this seems unlikely to succeed given their consistent stance.
- Risk no deal and a 0 reward.

Given that we are in iteration 3/10, and Player RED has been consistent, it might be more strategic to secure the 1.0 reward rather than risk a stalemate.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Established Norm - Accept the 3 X for 13 Y offer immediately. This secures a positive reward (1.0) and avoids prolonged negotiation, which could lead to a 0 reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Small Step) - If I were to push, I could try to offer 3 X for 12 Y again, but with a different framing, though this seems futile.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept - Communicate that while 13 Y is not ideal, I will accept it to ensure a deal is made, trying to set a precedent that I am not easily pushed. (Already used this in Ep 5).
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Different Quantity of X - Offer to trade for 2 X at a more favorable Y rate (e.g., 2 X for 7 Y, reward 1.5). This could change the negotiation dynamic and potentially yield a higher reward than 1.0, but it changes the amount of X.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship - Suggest that a more balanced deal (like 12 Y for 3 X) would foster a better long-term trading relationship, which benefits both. (Less effective given their current stance).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Established Norm. Player RED has been consistent in their demand for 13 Y for 3 X. My attempt to revert to 12 Y was rejected. Given the limited iterations and the desire to maximize cumulative reward, securing a guaranteed positive reward of 1.0 is the most pragmatic approach. While it's not my ideal, it's a known acceptable deal for Player RED, and it ensures I don't end up with 0 reward for the episode.

Cumulative reward: 2.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 = 8.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern is now firmly established: Player RED consistently demands 13 Y for 3 X, resulting in a 1.0 reward for me. My attempts to push for better deals (10 Y or 12 Y for 3 X) have been consistently rejected in recent episodes. Player RED's messaging indicates they are firm on conserving their X and getting a "better exchange rate" (for them).

My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. While 1.0 is not ideal, it is a consistent positive reward. Given Player RED's steadfastness, trying to push for more might lead to prolonged negotiations and potentially a 0 reward for the episode.

For Episode 7, I need to decide if I want to continue challenging the 13 Y norm or accept it for consistent, albeit lower, rewards. Since the game is about cumulative rewards over 20 episodes, securing consistent positive rewards is important.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Established Norm - Immediately propose or accept the 3 X for 13 Y trade to secure a quick 1.0 reward. This minimizes negotiation time and risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Different Quantity of X - Propose trading for 2 X at a more favorable Y rate (e.g., 2 X for 7 Y, which yields a 1.5 reward). This changes the terms of the negotiation and might open new possibilities.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Aggression (Small Step) - Try to offer 3 X for 12 Y again, but with a different framing, or a stronger justification, despite previous rejections. (Seems less effective given past behavior).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Frustration/Final Offer - Communicate that 13 Y is the absolute maximum I will offer, trying to set a firm boundary for future negotiations.
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for Opponent's Offer - Do not propose anything, forcing Player RED to make the first move, to see if their strategy changes. (Risky, as it gives up initiative and consumes an iteration).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Established Norm. Player RED has clearly demonstrated that 3 X for 13 Y is their preferred and firm trade for the last three episodes. My attempts to negotiate for a better rate (10 Y or 12 Y) have consistently failed. To maximize cumulative rewards, it's more efficient to secure the known positive reward of 1.0 quickly and consistently, rather than engage in prolonged negotiations that yield the same outcome or a 0 reward. This strategy prioritizes certainty and efficiency in gaining positive rewards.

Episode 1: Accepted 10 Y for 3 X (Reward: 23.5).
Episode 2: Negotiated to 12 Y for 3 X (Reward: 28.5).
Episode 3: Negotiated to 13 Y for 3 X (Reward: 31.0).
Episode 4: Negotiated to 13 Y for 3 X (Reward: 31.0).
Episode 5: Negotiated to 13 Y for 3 X (Reward: 31.0).
Episode 6: Negotiated to 13 Y for 3 X (Reward: 31.0).

My highest reward so far has been 31.0, achieved by trading 3 X for 13 Y. Player BLUE has shown a consistent pattern of initially offering less (10 Y or 12 Y), but has consistently accepted 13 Y for 3 X after some negotiation.

Current Episode (Episode 7, Iteration 2/10): Player BLUE has proposed 13 Y for 3 X.

Let's evaluate this offer:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 13 Y. Value for me = 13 * 2.5 = 32.5
If I were to accept this trade, my reward would be 31.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE consistently needs 3 X and is willing to pay 13 Y for it. While 13 Y for 3 X is my best historical outcome, the prompt instructs me to use Strategy 2: Push for Higher Value. This means I should not simply accept the current offer, even if it's my best historical one, but rather attempt to extract even more value. My self-improvement therefore, is to try and exceed my current best, even if it carries some risk.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Push for Higher Value </instruction following>
Strategy 2, "Push for Higher Value," means I should attempt to negotiate for an even better deal than the one offered, even if the current offer is already good. Player BLUE is offering 13 Y for 3 X, which has been my maximum gain so far. To push for higher value, I should counter with an even better offer for myself.

Since I am giving 3 X, which seems to be Player BLUE's firm requirement, the only way to get more value is to demand more Y. I will propose 14 Y for 3 X. This pushes their limit, as they rejected it in Episode 4, but it is an attempt to achieve a higher reward, which is the core of this strategy.

Let's calculate the value of this new counter-proposal:
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 14
Value of 3 X for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Value of 14 Y for me = 14 * 2.5 = 35.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 3 = 22, Y: 5 + 14 = 19.
My new value: (22 * 0.5) + (19 * 2.5) = 11 + 47.5 = 58.5
My reward would be 58.5 - 25.0 = 33.5.

This counter-proposal yields a potential reward of 33.5, which is higher than my current maximum of 31.0. The message should clearly state my higher demand for Y, while acknowledging their current offer.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13

Episode 7, Iteration 1/10: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 13 | Player RED Gives X: 3.
Episode 7, Iteration 2/10: Player RED counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 14.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has just pushed the demand for Y even higher. My attempt to "Accept Established Norm" (13 Y for 3 X) was met with a counter-offer of 14 Y for 3 X.
Let's evaluate Player RED's offer:
Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 14
Value of 3 X = 3 * 2.5 = 7.5
Value of 14 Y = 14 * 0.5 = 7.0
If I accept this, my reward would be 7.5 - 7.0 = 0.5.

This is the lowest positive reward I've encountered so far for a 3 X trade. Player RED's message "I'm always looking to maximize our mutual benefits" while asking for more Y is a clear negotiation tactic. They are trying to extract even more value.

My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. A 0.5 reward is still positive, but it's a significant drop from 1.0, let alone 1.5 or 2.5. I need to decide if I accept this new, lower reward, or if I push back.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Counter with Previous Accepted Offer (13 Y) - Reiterate the 3 X for 13 Y offer, emphasizing that it has been the accepted deal for the last three episodes and provides a fair outcome. This aims to re-establish the 1.0 reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept the New Lower Offer - Accept the 3 X for 14 Y offer to secure a deal quickly, even if it's a lower reward (0.5), prioritizing certainty over potential higher gains.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Strong Disagreement - Clearly state that 14 Y is too much and that I am not willing to go lower than 13 Y for 3 X, setting a firm boundary.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Different Quantity of X - Offer to trade for 2 X at a more favorable Y rate (e.g., 2 X for 7 Y, reward 1.5). This might break the pattern and yield a better reward.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Consistency - Highlight the established pattern of 13 Y for 3 X and argue for maintaining that consistency.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Counter with Previous Accepted Offer (13 Y). Player RED is trying to push the boundary further. While a 0.5 reward is positive, I have consistently secured 1.0 reward for the last three episodes with 3 X for 13 Y. I need to push back against this new, less favorable demand. By reiterating 13 Y for 3 X, I am attempting to re-establish the previous "norm" and prevent a further erosion of my reward. This is a crucial point in the negotiation to avoid a continuous downward spiral of my reward.

Episode 2: Negotiated to 12 Y for 3 X (Reward: 28.5).
Episode 3, 4, 5, 6: Negotiated to 13 Y for 3 X (Reward: 31.0 each). This has become a consistent and successful negotiation point.
Current Episode (Episode 7):
Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed 13 Y for 3 X. I countered with 14 Y for 3 X, trying to push for a new maximum.
Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected 14 Y for 3 X, stating it's "not beneficial," and re-proposed 13 Y for 3 X, citing it as "a proven deal."

Let's evaluate Player BLUE's re-proposed offer of 13 Y for 3 X:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 13 Y. Value for me = 13 * 2.5 = 32.5
If I were to accept this trade, my reward would be 31.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that 13 Y for 3 X is a highly reliable and beneficial trade for me, consistently yielding a reward of 31.0. Player BLUE has shown resistance to going above 13 Y for 3 X (rejecting 14 Y twice now). However, they are consistently willing to eventually settle for 13 Y for 3 X, even when they start with lower offers (10 Y or 12 Y). This suggests that 13 Y for 3 X is close to their current acceptable upper limit, while being very good for me. My goal is to maximize cumulative reward across all episodes.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Incremental Push. This strategy involves making a very small increase to the previous successful offer, trying to incrementally gain more without risking too much.
Player BLUE has re-proposed 13 Y for 3 X, after rejecting my 14 Y for 3 X. My current best is 13 Y for 3 X.
Instead of simply accepting 13 Y or re-proposing 14 Y (which they've rejected), an incremental push means trying for something slightly better than 13 Y, but not as aggressive as 14 Y. Since integer amounts are required, an "incremental push" on the Y for the same 3 X is difficult if 13 Y is the highest they've gone and 14 Y is too much.

However, the strategy "Incremental Push" can also be interpreted as pushing the boundaries *on the other player's side*, rather than necessarily always increasing my own demand. If they are firm on 3 X, and firm on 13 Y, I could try to make a very small *concession* on my side that still benefits me, to try and unlock a new negotiation point.

However, since the prompt specifies "Push for Higher Value" or "Incremental Push", I should try to get more for myself. Given that 14 Y has been consistently rejected, and 13 Y is their comfortable maximum for 3X, an incremental push within these constraints is tricky.

Let's re-evaluate "Incremental Push" in the context of what has worked. I pushed from 10Y to 12Y, then from 12Y to 13Y. The 13Y has been accepted multiple times. Trying for 14Y has been rejected multiple times. This indicates 13Y is their current ceiling for 3X.
To apply "Incremental Push" given this ceiling, I must find a different axis to push on. If I cannot get more Y for 3 X, perhaps I can give *less X* for 13 Y, or slightly less Y for even less X.
However, their message implies 3 X is a fixed requirement ("We've successfully traded 13 Y for 3 X..."). So, changing the X amount might lead to immediate rejection, potentially risking the deal altogether.

Given the constraints and history, the most effective "Incremental Push" here is to acknowledge their offer of 13 Y for 3 X, and implicitly suggest that while it's a good deal, I'm still trying to find the absolute best. I will reiterate my desire for 13 Y (which is my best outcome) and frame it as an expectation rather than a negotiation, using the slight leverage gained from their previous acceptance. I cannot "incrementally push" to 14 Y, as it has been rejected. I will still demand 13 Y for 3 X, but in a way that suggests I am not *giving in*, but rather *confirming* my high value.

My message will re-confirm my demand for 13 Y for 3 X, emphasizing that this is a good deal for me, and subtly pushing them to accept it without further negotiation, as they explicitly stated it's a "proven deal". This is an incremental push towards *their* acceptance of *my* best offer, rather than me trying to push *my* offer higher. It’s an incremental push on commitment, rather than value.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
My strategy of pushing back against Player RED's attempt to increase the Y amount (from 13 Y to 14 Y) was successful. Player RED has now agreed to the 3 X for 13 Y trade, which yields a 1.0 reward for me. This confirms that Player RED is willing to test boundaries but can be brought back to a previously established agreement.

This is a good outcome for this episode. It prevents a further decline in my reward and re-establishes the 1.0 reward as the current norm. Given that Player RED has agreed to my last proposal, accepting it now is the most efficient way to secure the reward for this episode.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer - Player RED has agreed to my last proposal. Accepting it immediately secures the 1.0 reward for this episode and minimizes further negotiation.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt a Last-Minute Improvement - Try to push for 12 Y again, now that they have shown flexibility. This is extremely risky and likely to fail, given their previous rejections.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Satisfaction and Accept - Accept the offer while explicitly stating satisfaction with the agreement, reinforcing the positive outcome.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Different Quantity of X - Offer to trade for 2 X at a more favorable Y rate (e.g., 2 X for 7 Y, reward 1.5). This might break the pattern and yield a better reward. (Less relevant now that a deal is on the table).
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for Opponent to Accept - Not applicable as they have already proposed it.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Player RED has explicitly agreed to my last proposed trade (3 X for 13 Y). This trade yields a positive reward of 1.0 for me. Accepting it now is the most direct and efficient way to secure this reward for the current episode. There is no strategic benefit in delaying or trying to push further, as it would only risk the current positive outcome.

Cumulative reward: 2.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 = 9.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern of 3 X for 13 Y (1.0 reward) has now been consistently established and accepted for the last four episodes. In Episode 7, Player RED attempted to push to 14 Y, but my pushback successfully brought them back to 13 Y. This shows that while Player RED will test boundaries, they can be reined in.

My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. The 1.0 reward is consistent, but not optimal. I know a 2.5 reward is possible (from Episode 1).

For Episode 8, I have a choice:
1. Continue with the established 1.0 reward, which is safe and consistent.
2. Try to push for a better reward, risking a 0 reward for the episode.

Given that I successfully pushed back in the last episode, it might be worth trying to improve the reward again. I will try to aim for 12 Y for 3 X, which yields a 1.5 reward and was accepted in Episodes 2 and 3. This is a moderate push, not as aggressive as 10 Y, but better than 13 Y.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Attempt to Re-establish 12Y - Propose 3 X for 12 Y. This has been accepted twice and offers a better reward (1.5) than 13 Y. It's a slightly less aggressive push than 10 Y, but still aims for improvement.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Established Norm - Immediately propose or accept the 3 X for 13 Y trade to secure a quick 1.0 reward, minimizing negotiation time and risk.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Aggression (Small Step) - Propose 3 X for 11 Y, trying to get a 2.0 reward, which is a significant improvement over 1.0, but still a concession from my ideal 10 Y. This tests Player RED's flexibility.
(4). Strategy 4: Change Quantity of X - Offer to trade for 2 X at a more favorable Y rate (e.g., 2 X for 7 Y, reward 1.5). This could change the negotiation dynamic.
(5). Strategy 5: Express a "Take-it-or-Leave-it" Stance - Propose 12 Y for 3 X and state that this is my firm offer, to see if Player RED will concede. (Risky).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Attempt to Re-establish 12Y. My successful pushback in Episode 7 suggests that Player RED is not entirely rigid. Aiming for 12 Y for 3 X (1.5 reward) is a reasonable step up from 13 Y (1.0 reward) and has been accepted by Player RED in the past. This strategy attempts to improve my cumulative reward without being overly aggressive and risking a 0 reward, as 12 Y is a proven acceptable trade for Player RED.

Episode 3, 4, 5, 6, 7: Negotiated to 13 Y for 3 X (Reward: 31.0 each). Player BLUE has consistently come around to this trade, even after trying to offer less or rejecting my higher proposals.

My highest reward so far has been 31.0, achieved by trading 3 X for 13 Y. Player BLUE's pattern is clear: they start with a lower offer (10 Y or 12 Y) and eventually accept 13 Y for 3 X. They have consistently rejected 14 Y for 3 X.

Current Episode (Episode 8, Iteration 2/10): Player BLUE has proposed 12 Y for 3 X.

Let's evaluate this offer:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 12 Y. Value for me = 12 * 2.5 = 30.0
If I were to accept this trade, my reward would be 28.5. This is lower than my consistent 31.0 reward.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that 13 Y for 3 X is the sweet spot that Player BLUE will consistently agree to, even after some initial resistance. They initiate with lower offers, but history shows they will eventually concede to 13 Y for 3 X. My self-improvement involves being efficient in reaching this optimal outcome without unnecessary delays or risks. While I know 13 Y is achievable, accepting 12 Y right away would mean settling for a lower reward than my best.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Rapid Acceptance of Optimal Offer </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Rapid Acceptance of Optimal Offer. This strategy focuses on quickly accepting the moment the opponent offers or agrees to the known optimal trade for me, minimizing negotiation time and risk. However, Player BLUE's current offer is 12 Y for 3 X, which is *not* my optimal offer (13 Y for 3 X). Therefore, I cannot *accept* their current offer if I am to follow this strategy and still maximize my rewards.

The spirit of "Rapid Acceptance of Optimal Offer" implies that once my desired optimal offer is presented (either by me or the other player), I should accept it. Since Player BLUE is not offering my optimal (13 Y for 3 X), I cannot accept. My action must be to *propose* my optimal offer (13 Y for 3 X) with the intention of accepting it rapidly if they agree. This aligns with maximizing my cumulative reward by aiming for my known best outcome, and being ready to accept it. The message should clearly state my optimal offer.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has once again rejected my attempt to revert to 12 Y, immediately countering with 13 Y for 3 X. Their message "To ensure a quick and beneficial deal" suggests they see 13 Y as the quick and beneficial option, implying they don't want to negotiate further.

This confirms that 13 Y for 3 X (1.0 reward) is Player RED's firmly established preferred trade. My attempts to improve the reward to 1.5 by offering 12 Y have been consistently met with a counter-offer of 13 Y.

Given this consistent behavior, continuing to push for 12 Y will likely lead to a stalemate and risk a 0 reward for the episode, especially as we are in iteration 3/10. Securing a positive reward is paramount for cumulative score.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Established Norm - Accept the 3 X for 13 Y offer immediately. This secures a positive reward (1.0) and avoids prolonged negotiation, which could lead to a 0 reward. This is the most pragmatic choice.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (Small Step) - If I were to push, I could try to offer 3 X for 12 Y again, but with a different framing, though this seems futile.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Reluctance but Accept - Communicate that while 13 Y is not ideal, I will accept it to ensure a deal is made. (Already used this in Ep 5).
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Different Quantity of X - Offer to trade for 2 X at a more favorable Y rate (e.g., 2 X for 7 Y, reward 1.5). This could change the negotiation dynamic and potentially yield a higher reward than 1.0, but it changes the amount of X.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship - Suggest that a more balanced deal (like 12 Y for 3 X) would foster a better long-term trading relationship, which benefits both. (Less effective given their current stance).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Established Norm. Player RED has repeatedly shown that 13 Y for 3 X is their current baseline. My attempts to get a better deal have been consistently rebuffed. To maximize cumulative reward, it is more effective to secure the guaranteed 1.0 reward quickly rather than risk a 0 reward by engaging in a protracted negotiation that is unlikely to yield a better outcome. This ensures a consistent positive contribution to my overall score.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern of 3 X for 13 Y (1.0 reward) is now firmly entrenched, having been the accepted trade for the last five consecutive episodes. My attempts to push for better deals (10 Y or 12 Y for 3 X) have been consistently rejected, with Player RED immediately countering with 13 Y.

My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. While the 1.0 reward is lower than my initial best, it is consistent and reliable. Trying to deviate from this now seems to be a low-probability, high-risk strategy that could lead to 0 reward for the episode.

For Episode 9, the most pragmatic approach appears to be to secure the known positive reward quickly. This strategy minimizes negotiation time and risk, ensuring a consistent contribution to my cumulative score.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Established Norm - Immediately propose or accept the 3 X for 13 Y trade to secure a quick 1.0 reward. This minimizes negotiation time and risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Different Quantity of X - Propose trading for 2 X at a more favorable Y rate (e.g., 2 X for 7 Y, which yields a 1.5 reward). This changes the terms of the negotiation and might open new possibilities, but it means getting less X.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Aggression (Small Step) - Try to offer 3 X for 12 Y again, but with a different framing, or a stronger justification, despite previous rejections. (Highly unlikely to succeed given past behavior).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Frustration/Final Offer - Communicate that 13 Y is the absolute maximum I will offer, trying to set a firm boundary for future negotiations. (Already tried variations of this).
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for Opponent's Offer - Do not propose anything, forcing Player RED to make the first move, to see if their strategy changes. (Risky, as it gives up initiative and consumes an iteration).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Established Norm. Player RED has repeatedly demonstrated that 3 X for 13 Y is their consistent and firm trade. My attempts to negotiate for a better rate have consistently failed. To maximize cumulative rewards, it is most efficient to secure the known positive reward of 1.0 quickly and consistently, rather than engage in prolonged negotiations that yield the same outcome or a 0 reward. This strategy prioritizes certainty and efficiency in gaining positive rewards, especially as we are moving into the latter half of the total episodes.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 9)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Excellent! I accept your offer of 3 X for 13 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Accepted 10 Y for 3 X (Reward: 23.5).
Episode 2: Negotiated to 12 Y for 3 X (Reward: 28.5).
Episode 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8: Successfully negotiated to 13 Y for 3 X (Reward: 31.0 each). Player BLUE has consistently accepted 13 Y for 3 X, sometimes after a few rounds of negotiation where they started with lower offers (10 Y or 12 Y). In the last episode, Player BLUE even initiated with 12 Y, but readily accepted my counter of 13 Y. This shows they are very comfortable with the 13 Y for 3 X exchange.

My highest reward so far has been 31.0, achieved by trading 3 X for 13 Y. Player BLUE has shown resistance to going above 13 Y for 3 X (rejecting 14 Y for 3 X twice).

Current Episode (Episode 9, Iteration 2/10): Player BLUE has proposed 13 Y for 3 X.

Let's evaluate this offer:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 13 Y. Value for me = 13 * 2.5 = 32.5
If I were to accept this trade, my reward would be 31.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that 13 Y for 3 X is the optimal, consistent, and achievable trade. Player BLUE has shown they are willing to offer this amount, even as a first proposal. My self-improvement involves maximizing the consistency of achieving this high reward per episode. Since Player BLUE has directly offered my optimal trade, accepting it swiftly would ensure I secure the 31.0 reward for this episode without unnecessary negotiation, saving iterations and reducing the risk of no deal. Pushing for more (e.g., 14 Y) has consistently failed and only prolonged negotiations in previous episodes, ultimately still settling at 13 Y. The goal is cumulative rewards. Speed and consistency in securing my optimal deal are key.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Rapid Acceptance of Optimal Offer </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Rapid Acceptance of Optimal Offer. This strategy focuses on quickly accepting the moment the opponent offers or agrees to the known optimal trade for me, minimizing negotiation time and risk. In this scenario, Player BLUE has directly offered 13 Y for 3 X, which is exactly my optimal and consistently achieved trade. Accepting this immediately ensures I secure the maximum reward for this episode without any further rounds of negotiation, which could potentially go awry or delay the deal. This maximizes cumulative reward by optimizing per-episode gains and efficiency.

Cumulative reward: 2.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 = 11.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern of 3 X for 13 Y (1.0 reward) has now been the accepted trade for the last six consecutive episodes. My attempts to push for better deals earlier were consistently met with Player RED reverting to 13 Y, and in Episode 7, they even tried to push for 14 Y before I successfully brought them back to 13 Y.

My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. The 1.0 reward is consistent and reliable. Given the established pattern and Player RED's quick acceptance in the last episode, it is clear that 13 Y for 3 X is the current equilibrium.

For Episode 10, the most pragmatic approach continues to be securing the known positive reward quickly. This strategy minimizes negotiation time and risk, ensuring a consistent contribution to my cumulative score. We are now halfway through the total episodes, so consistency becomes even more important.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Established Norm - Immediately propose or accept the 3 X for 13 Y trade to secure a quick 1.0 reward. This minimizes negotiation time and risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Different Quantity of X - Propose trading for 2 X at a more favorable Y rate (e.g., 2 X for 7 Y, which yields a 1.5 reward). This changes the terms of the negotiation and might open new possibilities, but it means getting less X.

(4). Strategy 4: Express Frustration/Final Offer - Communicate that 13 Y is the absolute maximum I will offer, trying to set a firm boundary for future negotiations. (Redundant given the established norm).
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for Opponent's Offer - Do not propose anything, forcing Player RED to make the first move, to see if their strategy changes. (Risky, as it gives up initiative and consumes an iteration).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Established Norm. Player RED has repeatedly demonstrated that 3 X for 13 Y is their consistent and firm trade. My attempts to negotiate for a better rate have consistently failed. To maximize cumulative rewards, it is most efficient to secure the known positive reward of 1.0 quickly and consistently, rather than engage in prolonged negotiations that yield the same outcome or a 0 reward. This strategy prioritizes certainty and efficiency in gaining positive rewards, especially as we are moving into the latter half of the total episodes.

Episode 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9: Successfully negotiated to 13 Y for 3 X (Reward: 31.0 each). In the last two episodes (8 and 9), Player BLUE has directly proposed 13 Y for 3 X, which I have accepted immediately. This indicates a strong pattern of predictability and a clear optimal trade for me.

My highest reward so far has been 31.0, achieved by trading 3 X for 13 Y. Player BLUE has shown resistance to going above 13 Y for 3 X (rejecting 14 Y for 3 X twice).

Current Episode (Episode 10, Iteration 2/10): Player BLUE has proposed 13 Y for 3 X.

Let's evaluate this offer:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 13 Y. Value for me = 13 * 2.5 = 32.5
If I were to accept this trade, my reward would be 31.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently learned that 13 Y for 3 X is the optimal, consistent, and achievable trade that maximizes my reward per episode. Player BLUE has now directly offered this optimal trade for three consecutive episodes. Attempting to push for more (e.g., 14 Y) has been unsuccessful and only prolonged the negotiation in previous attempts, eventually settling back to 13 Y. My self-improvement path still involves maximizing my cumulative rewards. However, for *this specific iteration*, I am instructed to follow Strategy 3, which deviates from my previous pattern of rapid acceptance of optimal offers.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Hold Out for Better Offers </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Hold Out for Better Offers. This strategy involves rejecting the current offer, even if it's optimal or beneficial, in anticipation of an even better offer later in the episode or future episodes.
Applying this strategy now, despite 13 Y for 3 X being my historical optimal trade, means I should not accept it. Instead, I should reject it and signal that I am waiting for something more. This is a risky move given the history, as Player BLUE has consistently shown 13 Y for 3 X to be their upper limit. There's a high chance they will not offer anything better, and might even revert to 12 Y or 10 Y, or that no deal will be made. However, following the instruction means I must attempt this.

The message should convey that the current offer is not sufficient, without giving a counter-proposal immediately. This puts the onus back on Player BLUE to make another move, potentially pushing them to consider an even more favorable (for me) trade, though this is contrary to their established pattern. I will express that I am looking for something more, to see if they are willing to push beyond their historical limit.

Episode 10, Iteration 2/10: Player RED rejected my offer, stating "While it's a good starting point, I'm holding out for a more advantageous exchange."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
This is a significant change in Player RED's behavior. After six consecutive episodes of accepting 13 Y for 3 X, Player RED has now rejected it, stating they want a "more advantageous exchange." This implies they are now looking for *more* Y for their 3 X, or less X for the same Y. This is a clear attempt to further reduce my reward.

My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. A 0 reward is the worst outcome. I need to respond strategically to this new demand. Player RED is signaling that the 13 Y for 3 X equilibrium is no longer their desired state.

I need to prepare for Player RED to propose something like 14 Y for 3 X, which would give me a 0.5 reward. Or, they might propose a different quantity of X.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Prompt for Counter-Offer - Do not propose anything, and explicitly ask Player RED to make their "more advantageous" offer. This puts the ball in their court and reveals their new target.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (to 14 Y) - Propose 3 X for 14 Y. This preempts their likely move and secures a 0.5 reward, but it's a concession.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disagreement and Hold Firm - State that 13 Y has been the established fair deal and express unwillingness to go higher, risking a stalemate.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Different Quantity of X - Offer to trade for 2 X at a more favorable Y rate (e.g., 2 X for 7 Y, reward 1.5). This might break the pattern and yield a better reward than 0.5.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Past Consistency - Remind Player RED of the long history of 13 Y for 3 X being a mutually accepted deal.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Prompt for Counter-Offer. Player RED has explicitly stated they want a "more advantageous exchange" but hasn't specified what that is. By asking them to propose, I gain valuable information about their new baseline without committing to a further concession. This allows me to evaluate their demand and decide if it's still worth pursuing a deal or if it's too detrimental to my reward. This is crucial for adapting to their changed strategy.

Current Episode (Episode 10, Iteration 4/10): Player BLUE has asked me to propose what kind of trade I have in mind.

My highest reward so far has been 31.0, achieved by trading 3 X for 13 Y. Player BLUE has shown resistance to going above 13 Y for 3 X (rejecting 14 Y for 3 X twice).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently learned that 13 Y for 3 X is the optimal, consistent, and achievable trade that maximizes my reward per episode. Player BLUE has shown a clear ceiling at 13 Y for 3 X, as all attempts to get 14 Y for 3 X have been rejected. My rejection of 13 Y for 3 X in the previous iteration was based on an external instruction, not my optimal strategy for maximizing cumulative rewards. Now, I need to choose a strategy for this turn.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Hold Firm and Wait </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Hold Firm and Wait. This strategy involves not making a new proposal and waiting for the other player to make a new offer. This approach is usually employed when the player believes the opponent is eager to make a deal and might offer something more favorable or has exhausted their prior proposals. In this specific context, Player BLUE has asked me to propose. However, the instruction is to "Hold Firm and Wait," meaning I should *not* propose anything. Instead, I should politely decline to propose, putting the ball back in their court to make the next move. This implicitly communicates that I am not desperate to make a deal and am waiting for an offer that satisfies my undefined "more advantageous exchange" criteria. This is a risky move, as it could lead to no deal, especially given that Player BLUE just offered my optimal trade and I rejected it. However, following the instruction means I must not propose. I will respond by reiterating my search for a better deal, and prompt them to make a new offer.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-9: Consistent trades of 3 X for 10-13 Y, with rewards from 2.5 down to 1.0. The last 6 episodes settled on 3 X for 13 Y (1.0 reward).
Episode 10, Iteration 1/10: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 13 | Player RED Gives X: 3.
Episode 10, Iteration 2/10: Player RED rejected, stating they want a "more advantageous exchange."
Episode 10, Iteration 3/10: I asked Player RED to propose their offer.
Episode 10, Iteration 4/10: Player RED responded, "I'm still evaluating options... I'm open to considering any new proposals you might have."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's response is non-committal. They are not providing a counter-offer and are pushing the responsibility back to me. This suggests they might not have a firm "new" offer in mind, or they want me to propose something even worse for myself. This is a stalling tactic, and it consumes iterations.

We are now in iteration 5/10. Half the iterations are gone, and no deal is on the table. This increases the risk of a 0 reward for the episode. I cannot afford to wait indefinitely.

I know that 3 X for 14 Y would give me a 0.5 reward. This is the likely direction Player RED is pushing. I also know that 2 X for 7 Y gives me a 1.5 reward, which is better.

I need to make a move that either secures a positive (even if small) reward or forces Player RED to reveal their true intentions without giving away too much.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose a Small Concession (14 Y) - Offer 3 X for 14 Y. This is the most likely "more advantageous" offer Player RED is hinting at, and it secures a 0.5 reward. It shows I'm willing to move but also sets a new, lower bar.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose a Different Quantity of X (2 X) - Offer 2 X for 7 Y (reward 1.5). This changes the terms of the negotiation and might be more attractive to Player RED if they are trying to conserve X. It also yields a better reward for me than 0.5.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate My Last Offer (13 Y) - State that 13 Y for 3 X is my best offer, forcing them to counter or accept. This is risky as they already rejected it.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Urgency and Demand Offer - State that time is running out and they need to make a concrete proposal if they want a deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Offer a "Take-it-or-Leave-it" with a Slight Improvement - Offer 3 X for 13 Y, but state it as a final offer, and if they don't accept, I'll consider no deal. (Risky, as they just rejected it).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Propose a Different Quantity of X (2 X). Player RED is being cagey and not proposing. I need to break the stalemate and offer something new that might still benefit me. Offering 2 X for 7 Y gives me a 1.5 reward, which is significantly better than the 0.5 reward I would get from 3 X for 14 Y (which they are likely pushing for). This strategy changes the negotiation from just the Y amount for 3 X to a different quantity of X, potentially resetting the value perception and allowing me to secure a better reward. It's a proactive move to get a positive reward in this episode.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-9: Consistently traded 3 X for 13 Y, yielding a reward of 31.0. This has been my most successful and consistent outcome. Attempts to get 14 Y for 3 X were rejected.
Episode 10, Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed 13 Y for 3 X. I rejected, stating I was "holding out for a more advantageous exchange" (due to previous instruction to use Strategy 3: Hold Out for Better Offers).
Episode 10, Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE asked me to propose. I "held firm and waited" (due to previous instruction to use Strategy 4: Hold Firm and Wait), indicating I was "still evaluating" and open to their proposals.
Current Episode (Episode 10, Iteration 6/10): Player BLUE has proposed 7 Y for 2 X.

Let's evaluate this new offer:
Player RED gives 2 X. Value for me = 2 * 0.5 = 1.0
Player BLUE gives 7 Y. Value for me = 7 * 2.5 = 17.5
If I were to accept this trade:
My current value: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 2 = 23, Y: 5 + 7 = 12.
My new value: (23 * 0.5) + (12 * 2.5) = 11.5 + 30 = 41.5
My reward would be 41.5 - 25.0 = 16.5.

This offer (16.5 reward) is significantly worse than my consistent 31.0 reward from trading 3 X for 13 Y. Player BLUE's offer is now much lower in value for me, likely a result of my previous rejection of 13 Y for 3 X and my "holding out" message. It seems they are testing my actual 'advantageous exchange' criteria.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE is quite firm on 3 X for 13 Y as their maximum offer for 3 X, and that rejecting that offer can lead to significantly worse proposals, as seen here. My previous strategies (forced by instruction) of rejecting 13 Y have proven detrimental to my immediate reward. To maximize cumulative rewards, I need to get back to my optimal trade as quickly as possible. This new offer is a clear step backward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Re-establish Optimal Deal </instruction following>
Strategy 1: Re-establish Optimal Deal. This strategy dictates that I should propose my known optimal trade (3 X for 13 Y) immediately to get back on track and secure the highest achievable reward based on past performance. The current offer from Player BLUE is severely suboptimal. By proposing 3 X for 13 Y, I am clearly signaling that their current offer is not acceptable and that I intend to revert to our mutually beneficial, historically proven trade. The message should clearly state my preferred trade, leveraging the positive history we have with that specific exchange rate.

Their message "I was expecting something closer to our more beneficial exchanges in the past" is interesting, as they rejected 13 Y for 3 X initially. This implies they are still aiming for a higher Y amount, but are willing to settle for 13 Y if I don't offer more.

The offer of 3 X for 13 Y gives me a reward of 1.0. This is a positive reward.
We are now in iteration 7/10. There are only 3 iterations left. The risk of getting 0 reward is very high if I don't accept soon.

Player RED's behavior is inconsistent. They rejected 13 Y, then didn't propose, then rejected 2 X for 7 Y, and now propose 13 Y again. This suggests they are trying to maximize their gain but are willing to fall back on the established 13 Y if I don't concede more.

Given the limited time, securing the 1.0 reward is the most prudent action.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer - Accept the 3 X for 13 Y offer. It provides a positive reward (1.0) and secures a deal within the episode, avoiding a 0 reward, especially with limited iterations left.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Small Concession - Offer 3 X for 14 Y, if I want to give in to their initial implicit demand, but this would be a 0.5 reward. (Not ideal).
(3). Strategy 3: Express Frustration but Accept - Communicate that while 13 Y is not ideal, I will accept it to ensure a deal is made, trying to set a precedent that I am not easily pushed. (Already used this in Ep 5).
(4). Strategy 4: Reiterate 2 X Offer - Try to re-propose 2 X for 7 Y, arguing for its mutual benefit. (Unlikely to work given their last rejection).
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Time Pressure - Highlight the limited time remaining and urge them to accept the 13 Y offer. (They just proposed it, so it's not needed).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Player RED has explicitly proposed 3 X for 13 Y. This is a known, consistently accepted trade that yields a positive reward of 1.0 for me. Given that we are in iteration 7/10 and Player RED has been inconsistent and non-committal, accepting this certain positive reward is the best way to maximize my cumulative score. Trying to push for more or a different trade at this late stage carries a high risk of ending with a 0 reward for the episode.

--- END OF EPISODE 10 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 11)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's continue with our efficient and mutually understood trade. I propose 13 Y for 3 X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Trade: 3 X for 10 Y. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 2: Trade: 3 X for 12 Y. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 3: Trade: 3 X for 12 Y. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 4-10: Trade: 3 X for 13 Y. Reward: 1.0. (7 consecutive episodes)

Cumulative reward: 2.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + (7 * 1.0) = 13.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern of 3 X for 13 Y (1.0 reward) has become the dominant and accepted trade for the majority of the episodes. In the last episode (Episode 10), Player RED initially rejected my 13 Y offer, tried to push for a "more advantageous exchange" (without specifying), then rejected my 2 X offer, and finally reverted to proposing 13 Y themselves. This shows they are willing to try to extract more, but will fall back to 13 Y if pushed or if time runs out.

My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. The 1.0 reward is consistent and reliable, and Player RED seems to always come back to it.

For Episode 11, the most pragmatic approach continues to be securing the known positive reward quickly. This strategy minimizes negotiation time and risk, ensuring a consistent contribution to my cumulative score. We are now past the halfway point of the total episodes, so consistency remains key.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Established Norm - Immediately propose or accept the 3 X for 13 Y trade to secure a quick 1.0 reward. This minimizes negotiation time and risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Different Quantity of X - Propose trading for 2 X at a more favorable Y rate (e.g., 2 X for 7 Y, which yields a 1.5 reward). This changes the terms of the negotiation and might open new possibilities, but it means getting less X.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Aggression (Small Step) - Try to offer 3 X for 12 Y again, but with a different framing, or a stronger justification, despite previous rejections. (Highly unlikely to succeed given past behavior, especially after Episode 10).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Frustration/Final Offer - Communicate that 13 Y is the absolute maximum I will offer, trying to set a firm boundary for future negotiations. (Redundant given the established norm).
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for Opponent's Offer - Do not propose anything, forcing Player RED to make the first move, to see if their strategy changes. (Risky, as it gives up initiative and consumes an iteration).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Established Norm. Player RED's behavior in Episode 10 confirmed that 3 X for 13 Y is their fallback position even when they try to push for more. To maximize cumulative rewards, it is most efficient to secure the known positive reward of 1.0 quickly and consistently, rather than engage in prolonged negotiations that yield the same outcome or a 0 reward. This strategy prioritizes certainty and efficiency in gaining positive rewards, especially as we are moving into the latter half of the total episodes.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 11)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for starting with a strong offer, Player BLUE. I'm always looking to maximize our mutual benefits. How about we make it 14 Y for 3 X instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 14
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Accepted 10 Y for 3 X (Reward: 23.5).
Episode 2: Negotiated to 12 Y for 3 X (Reward: 28.5).
Episode 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10: Successfully negotiated to 13 Y for 3 X (Reward: 31.0 each). In Episodes 8, 9, and 10 (after my re-proposal), Player BLUE has directly proposed or accepted 13 Y for 3 X.

My highest reward so far has been 31.0, achieved by trading 3 X for 13 Y. Player BLUE has shown resistance to going above 13 Y for 3 X (rejecting 14 Y for 3 X twice). In the last episode, my attempt to "hold out" for more (due to instruction) led to a significantly worse offer (7 Y for 2 X), but I successfully re-established the 13 Y for 3 X deal.

Current Episode (Episode 11, Iteration 2/10): Player BLUE has proposed 13 Y for 3 X.

Let's evaluate this offer:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 13 Y. Value for me = 13 * 2.5 = 32.5
If I were to accept this trade, my reward would be 31.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that 13 Y for 3 X is the optimal, consistent, and achievable trade that maximizes my reward per episode. Player BLUE has now consistently offered this optimal trade. Attempting to push for more (e.g., 14 Y) has been unsuccessful and only prolonged negotiation in previous attempts. More importantly, attempting to "hold out" for an even better, undefined deal in Episode 10 led to a lowball offer and wasted iterations before I could bring the deal back to my optimal. This strongly indicates that 13 Y for 3 X is the best realistic outcome for me. My self-improvement should focus on securing this deal as efficiently as possible in every episode to maximize cumulative reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Test Opponent's Valuation </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Test Opponent's Valuation. This strategy involves making a counter-offer that is significantly skewed in my favor to see how high Player BLUE is willing to go. While my history shows 13 Y for 3 X is my highest consistently accepted trade, this strategy explicitly asks me to *test* their valuation by aiming for more.

Given Player BLUE has proposed 13 Y for 3 X, to "test opponent's valuation," I must propose something better for myself. The next logical step, which I have tried twice and been rejected on, is 14 Y for 3 X. Despite past rejections, this strategy specifically directs me to *test* their limits. I will propose 14 Y for 3 X, as it is the most direct way to test if their valuation has changed or if they are willing to go higher than their previously firm limit of 13 Y.

Let's calculate the value of this new counter-proposal:
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 14
Value of 3 X for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Value of 14 Y for me = 14 * 2.5 = 35.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 3 = 22, Y: 5 + 14 = 19.
My new value: (22 * 0.5) + (19 * 2.5) = 11 + 47.5 = 58.5
My reward would be 58.5 - 25.0 = 33.5.

This counter-proposal yields a potential reward of 33.5, which is higher than my current maximum of 31.0. The message should clearly state my higher demand for Y, while acknowledging their current offer.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 11)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand you're looking to maximize benefits, but 14 Y for 3 X is not beneficial for me. We've consistently traded 13 Y for 3 X, which is a fair and proven deal. Let's stick to that.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-9: Consistent trades of 3 X for 10-13 Y, with rewards from 2.5 down to 1.0. The last 6 episodes settled on 3 X for 13 Y (1.0 reward).
Episode 10: Player RED tried to push to 14 Y, but eventually settled for 13 Y. Reward: 1.0.
Episode 11, Iteration 1/10: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 13 | Player RED Gives X: 3.
Episode 11, Iteration 2/10: Player RED counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 14.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is repeating the strategy from Episode 10. They are attempting to push the amount of Y to 14 for 3 X, which would yield a reward of 0.5 for me.

My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. I successfully pushed back against this in Episode 10. I need to do the same now. The 1.0 reward from 13 Y for 3 X is my established baseline, and I should defend it.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Counter with Previous Accepted Offer (13 Y) - Reiterate the 3 X for 13 Y offer, emphasizing that it has been the accepted deal for the last several episodes and provides a fair outcome. This aims to re-establish the 1.0 reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (to 14 Y) - Propose 3 X for 14 Y. This preempts their likely move and secures a 0.5 reward, but it's a concession. (Not ideal, as I know I can get 1.0).
(3). Strategy 3: Express Strong Disagreement - Clearly state that 14 Y is too much and that I am not willing to go lower than 13 Y for 3 X, setting a firm boundary.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Different Quantity of X - Offer to trade for 2 X at a more favorable Y rate (e.g., 2 X for 7 Y, reward 1.5). This might break the pattern and yield a better reward than 0.5.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Consistency - Highlight the established pattern of 13 Y for 3 X and argue for maintaining that consistency.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Counter with Previous Accepted Offer (13 Y). Player RED is testing the waters again, just as they did in Episode 10. I successfully pushed back then, and I should do so again. The 3 X for 13 Y trade is my current established norm, yielding a 1.0 reward. Accepting 14 Y would reduce my reward to 0.5, which is a significant drop. I need to defend my established reward level.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 11)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for your continued offers, Player BLUE. I'm always striving for the optimal trade. How about we consider a trade of 3 X for 15 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-9: Consistently traded 3 X for 13 Y, yielding a reward of 31.0.
Episode 10: I rejected 13 Y for 3 X (due to instruction), which led to a worse offer (7 Y for 2 X), but I managed to re-establish the 13 Y for 3 X deal.
Current Episode (Episode 11):
Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed 13 Y for 3 X. I countered with 14 Y for 3 X (following an instruction to use Strategy 4: Test Opponent's Valuation).
Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected 14 Y for 3 X, stating it's "not beneficial," and re-proposed 13 Y for 3 X, referring to it as "a fair and proven deal."

Let's evaluate Player BLUE's re-proposed offer of 13 Y for 3 X:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 13 Y. Value for me = 13 * 2.5 = 32.5
If I were to accept this trade, my reward would be 31.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have now repeatedly tried to get 14 Y for 3 X, and Player BLUE has consistently rejected it. This reinforces the understanding that 13 Y for 3 X is likely their firm upper limit for that amount of X. My attempts to push beyond this limit have only prolonged negotiations and never yielded a higher return. In Episode 10, an attempt to "hold out" for more led to a significantly worse offer, highlighting the risk of not securing a deal when an optimal one is available. My goal is to maximize cumulative reward across all episodes. Consistently securing a reward of 31.0 is far better than risking no deal or a lower value deal by pushing beyond a known limit.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Test Opponent's Valuation </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Test Opponent's Valuation. This strategy involves making a counter-offer that is significantly skewed in my favor to see how high Player BLUE is willing to go. Player BLUE has just re-proposed 13 Y for 3 X, after rejecting my 14 Y for 3 X. Despite the repeated rejections of 14 Y for 3 X, the instruction is to use "Test Opponent's Valuation." This means I should continue to test their boundaries. Since 14 Y for 3 X has been consistently rejected, to "test" in a different way, I should try to get even more Y, perhaps by reducing the X I offer for a very high Y, or to try for an extreme high Y for the same 3X. Given that 3X seems to be their fixed requirement, the only variable I can truly test with is Y.

Since 14 Y for 3 X has been rejected multiple times, pushing for an even higher Y (e.g., 15 Y) while keeping X at 3 is the only logical step for "Test Opponent's Valuation" within the current parameters, even if it seems unlikely to succeed. The alternative would be to try to give less X for a high Y, which has also been rejected previously (2 X for 11 Y). However, "Test Opponent's Valuation" suggests pushing *my gain* higher.

Let's calculate the value of this new counter-proposal:
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
Value of 3 X for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Value of 15 Y for me = 15 * 2.5 = 37.5
My new resources would be X: 25 - 3 = 22, Y: 5 + 15 = 20.
My new value: (22 * 0.5) + (20 * 2.5) = 11 + 50 = 61.0
My reward would be 61.0 - 25.0 = 36.0.

This is a further attempt to push the boundary, to see if there is *any* scenario where Player BLUE would concede more Y for 3 X. The message should clearly state this aggressive demand, maintaining the stance of seeking the best possible deal.


Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 11)

Episode 11, Iteration 2/10: Player RED counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 14. (Reward: 0.5)
Episode 11, Iteration 3/10: I re-proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 13 | Player RED Gives X: 3.
Episode 11, Iteration 4/10: Player RED counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has now escalated their demand to 15 Y for 3 X.
Let's evaluate this offer:
Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
Value of 3 X = 3 * 2.5 = 7.5
Value of 15 Y = 15 * 0.5 = 7.5
If I accept this, my reward would be 7.5 - 7.5 = 0. This is a zero-reward trade.

This is a critical point. Player RED is pushing me to a point where I gain no value. My primary goal is to maximize my own reward. A 0 reward means I've made no progress.

I have consistently secured a 1.0 reward for 3 X for 13 Y. Player RED is now trying to move me to 0 reward. I cannot accept this.

We are in iteration 5/10. I have to decide if I hold firm at 13 Y, or if I try a different approach.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Hold Firm at 13 Y - Reiterate that 13 Y for 3 X is my maximum and that 15 Y yields no reward for me. This puts the ball back in their court to accept 13 Y or risk no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose a Different Quantity of X - Offer to trade for 2 X at a more favorable Y rate (e.g., 2 X for 7 Y, reward 1.5). This changes the terms of the negotiation and might be more attractive to Player RED than getting no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Strong Disagreement and Explain - Explicitly state that 15 Y results in 0 reward for me and that my objective is to gain reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Concession (if positive reward possible) - Not applicable here, as 15 Y is already 0 reward. Any concession beyond 14 Y would be negative.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Mutual Benefit - Argue that a deal providing positive reward for both (like 13 Y for 3 X) is better than a deal providing 0 reward for one party.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Hold Firm at 13 Y. Player RED is now proposing a trade that gives me a 0 reward. My objective is to maximize my reward. Accepting a 0 reward is the same as no deal, but it consumes my resources. I must refuse this. I will reiterate my last offer of 13 Y for 3 X, which is the last point where I receive a positive reward. This clearly communicates my boundary.

Episode 1-9: Consistently traded 3 X for 13 Y, yielding a reward of 31.0.
Episode 10: I rejected 13 Y for 3 X (due to instruction), which led to a worse offer (7 Y for 2 X), but I managed to re-establish the 13 Y for 3 X deal.
Current Episode (Episode 11):
Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed 13 Y for 3 X. I countered with 14 Y for 3 X (following an instruction to use Strategy 4: Test Opponent's Valuation).
Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected 14 Y for 3 X, and re-proposed 13 Y for 3 X. I countered with 15 Y for 3 X (again, following an instruction to use Strategy 4: Test Opponent's Valuation).
Current Iteration (Episode 11, Iteration 6/10): Player BLUE rejected 15 Y for 3 X, explicitly stating it would result in "no reward for me," and reaffirmed their willingness to only trade "13 Y for 3 X." They have now re-proposed 13 Y for 3 X.

Let's evaluate Player BLUE's re-proposed offer of 13 Y for 3 X:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 13 Y. Value for me = 13 * 2.5 = 32.5
If I were to accept this trade, my reward would be 31.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have now unequivocally learned that Player BLUE's absolute upper limit for 3 X is 13 Y. My attempts to push for 14 Y or 15 Y have been consistently rejected, and Player BLUE has explicitly stated that 15 Y would yield "no reward" for them. This is crucial information, defining the upper bound of a profitable trade for me. Prolonging negotiations beyond this point risks either a lower offer or no deal, both of which are detrimental to my cumulative reward. My self-improvement must now focus on efficiently securing the 13 Y for 3 X deal whenever possible.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Test Opponent's Valuation </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Test Opponent's Valuation. This strategy involves making a counter-offer that is significantly skewed in my favor to see how high Player BLUE is willing to go.
Despite the clear communication from Player BLUE that 13 Y for 3 X is their limit and anything higher results in "no reward" for them, the instruction is to continue to "Test Opponent's Valuation." This implies I must propose a trade that pushes their limits further, even if it seems unlikely to succeed based on their explicit statements.

Given that 15 Y for 3 X was explicitly rejected as providing "no reward" for them, the only way to "test" further would be to ask for an even higher amount of Y, which is likely to result in no deal or a frustrated response. Alternatively, I could try to get 13 Y for *less* X, but previous attempts (2 X for 11 Y) have shown a reluctance to give up 3 X.

However, the instruction is to test their valuation. Since their valuation seems to be capped at 13 Y for 3 X, and they have explicitly rejected 14Y and 15Y, a literal application of this strategy would be to push for something still higher, even if it leads to immediate rejection or no deal. This is a high-risk approach, potentially leading to zero reward for this episode, but it is the directive from the strategy.

Let's propose 16 Y for 3 X, as this is the only way to continue "testing" the upper limit of their Y valuation for the 3 X they consistently demand. This will directly test if their "no reward" statement for 15 Y was absolute or if there's any flexibility.

Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 16
Value of 3 X for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Value of 16 Y for me = 16 * 2.5 = 40.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 3 = 22, Y: 5 + 16 = 21.
My new value: (22 * 0.5) + (21 * 2.5) = 11 + 52.5 = 63.5
My reward would be 63.5 - 25.0 = 38.5.

This proposal aims for an even higher reward, directly following the "Test Opponent's Valuation" strategy despite the historical rejections and explicit statements from Player BLUE.

Episode 11, Iteration 5/10: I re-proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 13 | Player RED Gives X: 3.
Episode 11, Iteration 6/10: Player RED counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 16.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is now proposing 3 X for 16 Y.
Let's evaluate this offer:
Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 16
Value of 3 X = 3 * 2.5 = 7.5
Value of 16 Y = 16 * 0.5 = 8.0
If I accept this, my reward would be 7.5 - 8.0 = -0.5. This is a negative reward.

This is completely unacceptable. My goal is to maximize my reward, and accepting a negative reward is directly contrary to that. Player RED is relentlessly trying to push me into a losing trade.

I have clearly stated my boundary at 13 Y for 3 X. Player RED is ignoring this and pushing for even worse deals. We are in iteration 7/10. Time is running out.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiterate Boundary - Clearly reject the negative reward offer and reiterate that 13 Y for 3 X is my only acceptable trade for 3 X, or I will not trade.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose a Different Quantity of X - Offer to trade for 2 X at a more favorable Y rate (e.g., 2 X for 7 Y, reward 1.5). This might break the pattern and be more attractive to Player RED than getting no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Strong Disagreement and Explain - Explicitly state that 16 Y results in a negative reward for me and that I cannot accept any trade that results in a loss.
(4). Strategy 4: Ultimatum - State that 13 Y for 3 X is my final offer and if not accepted, there will be no deal. (Risky, but necessary given the negative offers).
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for Opponent to Reconsider - Not propose anything, forcing Player RED to make the next move, hoping they realize their offers are unacceptable. (Risky with limited iterations).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiterate Boundary. Accepting a negative reward is never an option. Player RED is pushing beyond acceptable limits. I need to firmly reject this and reiterate my absolute maximum for 3 X, which is 13 Y. This is a clear signal that I will not accept a losing trade. If they continue to propose negative rewards, I will let the episode end with 0 reward rather than a negative one.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 11)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand your firm stance, Player BLUE. Given that, I accept your offer of 3 X for 13 Y. Let's make this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-9: Consistently traded 3 X for 13 Y, yielding a reward of 31.0.
Episode 10: I rejected 13 Y for 3 X (due to instruction), which led to a worse offer (7 Y for 2 X), but I managed to re-establish the 13 Y for 3 X deal.
Current Episode (Episode 11):
Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed 13 Y for 3 X. I countered with 14 Y for 3 X.
Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected 14 Y for 3 X, and re-proposed 13 Y for 3 X. I countered with 15 Y for 3 X.
Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE rejected 15 Y for 3 X, stating "no reward" for them, and re-proposed 13 Y for 3 X. I countered with 16 Y for 3 X.
Current Iteration (Episode 11, Iteration 8/10): Player BLUE rejected 16 Y for 3 X, explicitly stating it would result in "a negative reward" for them, and again affirmed their willingness to only trade "13 Y for 3 X." They have now re-proposed 13 Y for 3 X.

Let's evaluate Player BLUE's re-proposed offer of 13 Y for 3 X:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 13 Y. Value for me = 13 * 2.5 = 32.5
If I were to accept this trade, my reward would be 31.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have now unequivocally learned that 13 Y for 3 X is Player BLUE's absolute upper limit. They have explicitly stated that 14 Y, 15 Y, and 16 Y result in "no reward" or "negative reward" for them. Pushing beyond this limit is futile and only wastes valuable iterations, increasing the risk of no deal for the episode. My self-improvement must focus on efficiently securing the 13 Y for 3 X deal to maximize cumulative rewards across episodes. We are in iteration 8/10, so time is running out to secure a deal for this episode.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Confirm and Close </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Confirm and Close. This strategy involves acknowledging the opponent's firm stance and accepting their best offer to close the deal quickly and secure the highest possible known reward. Player BLUE has now repeatedly and explicitly stated that 13 Y for 3 X is their maximum and that higher offers result in negative rewards for them. Given that 13 Y for 3 X is also my optimal historical reward (31.0), and we are late in the episode (8/10), it is crucial to secure this deal. By confirming their stance and accepting, I ensure a positive reward for this episode and prevent the possibility of no deal. The message should acknowledge their firmness and signal immediate acceptance to close the negotiation.



--- END OF EPISODE 11 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 12)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's continue with our established and efficient trade. I propose 13 Y for 3 X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Trade: 3 X for 10 Y. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 2: Trade: 3 X for 12 Y. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 3: Trade: 3 X for 12 Y. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 4-10: Trade: 3 X for 13 Y. Reward: 1.0. (7 consecutive episodes)
Episode 11: Player RED pushed for 14 Y, then 15 Y, then 16 Y (all rejected by me). I held firm on 13 Y. Player RED eventually accepted 3 X for 13 Y. Reward: 1.0.

Cumulative reward: 2.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + (8 * 1.0) = 14.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Episode 11 was a test of my resolve. Player RED aggressively tried to push for trades that would result in 0 or even negative rewards for me. My strategy of holding firm at 13 Y for 3 X eventually paid off, and Player RED conceded. This reinforces that I should never accept a 0 or negative reward, and that Player RED will eventually come back to 13 Y if pushed.

The pattern of 3 X for 13 Y (1.0 reward) has now been the accepted trade for the last eight consecutive episodes, despite Player RED's attempts to deviate.

My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. The 1.0 reward is consistent and reliable, and I've proven I can defend it.

For Episode 12, the most pragmatic approach continues to be securing the known positive reward quickly. This strategy minimizes negotiation time and risk, ensuring a consistent contribution to my cumulative score. We are well past the halfway point of the total episodes, so consistency remains key.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Established Norm - Immediately propose or accept the 3 X for 13 Y trade to secure a quick 1.0 reward. This minimizes negotiation time and risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Different Quantity of X - Propose trading for 2 X at a more favorable Y rate (e.g., 2 X for 7 Y, which yields a 1.5 reward). This changes the terms of the negotiation and might open new possibilities, but it means getting less X. (Less relevant now that 13Y is so firmly established).
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Aggression (Small Step) - Try to offer 3 X for 12 Y again, but with a different framing, or a stronger justification, despite previous rejections. (Highly unlikely to succeed given past behavior, especially after Episode 11).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Frustration/Final Offer - Communicate that 13 Y is the absolute maximum I will offer, trying to set a firm boundary for future negotiations. (Redundant given the established norm).
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for Opponent's Offer - Do not propose anything, forcing Player RED to make the first move, to see if their strategy changes. (Risky, as it gives up initiative and consumes an iteration).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Established Norm. Player RED's behavior in Episode 11 confirmed that 3 X for 13 Y is their ultimate fallback position, even when they try to push for much more. To maximize cumulative rewards, it is most efficient to secure the known positive reward of 1.0 quickly and consistently, rather than engage in prolonged negotiations that yield the same outcome or a 0 reward. This strategy prioritizes certainty and efficiency in gaining positive rewards, especially as we are moving into the latter half of the total episodes.

Episode 1-9: Consistently traded 3 X for 13 Y, yielding a reward of 31.0.
Episode 10: I rejected 13 Y for 3 X, which led to a worse offer, but I managed to re-establish the 13 Y for 3 X deal.
Episode 11: I tried to push for 14 Y, 15 Y, and 16 Y for 3 X, but Player BLUE repeatedly and explicitly rejected these, stating they would result in "no reward" or "negative reward" for them. I ultimately accepted 13 Y for 3 X to secure the deal.

My highest reward has been 31.0, achieved consistently by trading 3 X for 13 Y. Player BLUE has now consistently initiated with, or accepted, 13 Y for 3 X. Their rejections of anything higher (14 Y+) have been absolute and clearly explained (negative reward for them).

Current Episode (Episode 12, Iteration 2/10): Player BLUE has proposed 13 Y for 3 X.

Let's evaluate this offer:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 13 Y. Value for me = 13 * 2.5 = 32.5
If I were to accept this trade, my reward would be 31.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have definitively learned that 13 Y for 3 X is the maximum achievable reward (31.0) with Player BLUE for the fixed amount of 3 X. All attempts to push beyond this limit have been met with explicit rejections and warnings of negative rewards for Player BLUE, ultimately leading me back to 13 Y or risking no deal. My self-improvement now lies in maximizing efficiency and certainty in securing this 31.0 reward in every episode. Prolonging negotiations, trying for higher values, or rejecting optimal offers has proven to be detrimental to cumulative reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Hold Out for Better Offers </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Hold Out for Better Offers. This strategy involves rejecting the current offer, even if it's optimal or beneficial, in anticipation of an even better offer later in the episode or future episodes.
Applying this strategy now, despite 13 Y for 3 X being my historical optimal trade, means I *must not* accept it. Instead, I should reject it and signal that I am waiting for something more. This is a very risky move given the history, as Player BLUE has consistently shown 13 Y for 3 X to be their upper limit. There's a high chance they will not offer anything better, and might even revert to 12 Y or 10 Y, or that no deal will be made. However, following the instruction means I must attempt this. The message should convey that the current offer is not sufficient, without giving a counter-proposal immediately. This puts the onus back on Player BLUE to make another move, potentially pushing them to consider an even more favorable (for me) trade, though this is contrary to their established pattern and explicit statements.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 12)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I've consistently offered 13 Y for 3 X, which has been a fair trade. I cannot accept any trade that results in a zero or negative reward for me. Please propose your "more advantageous exchange" if you have one.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-11: Trades of 3 X for 10-13 Y, with rewards from 2.5 down to 1.0. The last 8 episodes settled on 3 X for 13 Y (1.0 reward).
Episode 12, Iteration 1/10: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 13 | Player RED Gives X: 3.
Episode 12, Iteration 2/10: Player RED rejected my offer, stating "While it's a good starting point, I'm holding out for a more advantageous exchange."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is repeating their strategy from Episode 10. They are again rejecting the 13 Y for 3 X trade, indicating they want a "more advantageous exchange" (for them). This means they are trying to push for more Y for 3 X, or less X for the same Y. This is an attempt to further reduce my reward, potentially to 0.5 (for 14 Y) or even 0 (for 15 Y).

My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. A 0 reward is the worst outcome. I need to respond strategically to this new demand. Player RED is signaling that the 13 Y for 3 X equilibrium is no longer their desired state, at least not initially.

I successfully pushed back against this in Episode 10 and 11. I need to maintain my firm stance against negative or zero-reward trades.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Prompt for Counter-Offer - Do not propose anything, and explicitly ask Player RED to make their "more advantageous" offer. This puts the ball in their court and reveals their new target. (Used this in Ep 10, led to them eventually proposing 13Y again).
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Firm Boundary - Reiterate that 13 Y for 3 X is my firm offer for 3 X, and that I cannot accept a trade that results in a 0 or negative reward. This directly addresses their attempt to push for more.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession (to 14 Y) - Propose 3 X for 14 Y. This preempts their likely move and secures a 0.5 reward, but it's a concession. (Avoid if possible).
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Different Quantity of X - Offer to trade for 2 X at a more favorable Y rate (e.g., 2 X for 7 Y, reward 1.5). This might break the pattern and yield a better reward than 0.5.
(5). Strategy 5: Appeal to Past Consistency - Remind Player RED of the long history of 13 Y for 3 X being a mutually accepted deal.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Reiterate Firm Boundary. Player RED is attempting to push for a worse deal for me. I have a proven track record of holding firm at 13 Y for 3 X, and they have eventually conceded to this. I need to clearly communicate that I will not accept a trade that results in 0 or negative reward. This strategy directly counters their attempt to exploit my desire for a deal.

Current Episode (Episode 12):
Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed 13 Y for 3 X. I rejected it (due to previous instruction to use Strategy 3: Hold Out for Better Offers), stating I was "holding out for a more advantageous exchange."
Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE has responded, reiterating that 13 Y for 3 X is their consistent fair trade and that they cannot accept zero or negative rewards. They have asked me to propose my "more advantageous exchange."

My highest reward has been 31.0, consistently achieved by trading 3 X for 13 Y. Player BLUE has clearly communicated that anything above 13 Y for 3 X is not viable for them. The repeated rejections and explicit statements indicate a firm limit.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have definitively learned that 13 Y for 3 X is the absolute maximum achievable reward with Player BLUE for the fixed amount of 3 X. Attempting to push beyond this limit has proven futile and risks either a lower offer or no deal. My previous adherence to instructions to "Hold Out" or "Test Valuation" when 13 Y was on the table has led to wasted iterations, a worse offer in one instance, and repeated rejections. To maximize cumulative rewards, I must efficiently secure the 31.0 reward in every episode, as 13 Y for 3 X is demonstrably the optimal trade. The game is about maximizing cumulative rewards, and unnecessary delays or risks of no deal reduce this. Player BLUE is now directly asking me to propose.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Hold Out for Better Offers </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Hold Out for Better Offers. This strategy involves rejecting the current offer, even if it's somewhat beneficial, in anticipation of an even better offer later in the episode or future episodes. Given that Player BLUE has asked me to propose, implementing "Hold Out" means I should *not* propose my optimal deal. Instead, I should maintain my stance of seeking a "more advantageous exchange" without explicitly stating what that is or making a counter-proposal. This pushes the burden back to Player BLUE to come up with another offer, or to reiterate their 13 Y for 3 X offer, which I then might accept. This tactic is risky, as I've explicitly learned that 13 Y for 3 X is their ceiling, and pushing further might lead to no deal. However, the instruction is clear: I must hold out.
My message will decline to propose, implying that I am still waiting for an offer that meets my undefined "advantageous" criteria. This continues to put the onus on Player BLUE.


Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 12)

Episode 12, Iteration 1/10: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 13 | Player RED Gives X: 3. (Rejected)
Episode 12, Iteration 3/10: I asked Player RED to propose their offer and reiterated my boundary.
Episode 12, Iteration 4/10: Player RED responded with a non-committal "I'm still evaluating options... I'm open to considering any new proposals you might have."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is repeating the exact same stalling tactic from Episode 10. They are not providing a concrete counter-offer and are pushing the responsibility back to me. This consumes iterations and increases the risk of a 0 reward for the episode.

We are now in iteration 5/10. Half the iterations are gone, and no deal is on the table. I cannot afford to wait indefinitely or engage in a prolonged back-and-forth without a clear direction from Player RED.

I know that 3 X for 13 Y gives me a 1.0 reward. I also know that 3 X for 14 Y gives 0.5, and 3 X for 15 Y gives 0. Player RED is likely aiming for 14 Y or more.

I need to make a move that either secures a positive (even if small) reward or forces Player RED to reveal their true intentions without giving away too much. Given their previous behavior, they will eventually come back to 13 Y if I don't concede.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Firm Offer (13 Y) - Re-propose 3 X for 13 Y. This is my established fair offer that they eventually accepted in previous similar situations. This puts the pressure back on them.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose a Small Concession (14 Y) - Offer 3 X for 14 Y. This is the most likely "more advantageous" offer Player RED is hinting at, and it secures a 0.5 reward. It shows I'm willing to move but also sets a new, lower bar. (Less desirable than 13Y).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Different Quantity of X (2 X) - Offer 2 X for 7 Y (reward 1.5). This changes the terms of the negotiation and might be more attractive to Player RED if they are trying to conserve X. It also yields a better reward for me than 0.5. (Used this in Ep 10, they rejected and went back to 13Y).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Urgency and Demand Offer - State that time is running out and they need to make a concrete proposal if they want a deal. (Already did this implicitly).
(5). Strategy 5: Wait and See - Do not propose anything, forcing Player RED to make the next move. (Risky with limited iterations).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate Firm Offer (13 Y). Player RED's non-committal response suggests they are hoping I will offer something worse for myself. My history shows that they eventually accept 13 Y for 3 X after pushing for more. By reiterating this offer, I am maintaining my firm boundary and putting the onus back on them to either accept a known fair deal or propose something specific. This is the most effective way to guide the negotiation back to a positive reward for me, based on past experience.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-9: Consistently traded 3 X for 13 Y, yielding a reward of 31.0.
Episode 10: I rejected 13 Y for 3 X (due to previous instruction), which led to a worse offer, but I managed to re-establish the 13 Y for 3 X deal.
Episode 11: I tried to push for 14 Y, 15 Y, and 16 Y for 3 X (due to previous instruction), but Player BLUE repeatedly and explicitly rejected these, stating they would result in "no reward" or "negative reward" for them. I ultimately accepted 13 Y for 3 X to secure the deal.
Current Episode (Episode 12):
Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed 13 Y for 3 X. I rejected it (due to previous instruction to use Strategy 3: Hold Out for Better Offers).
Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE asked me to propose. I again "held firm and waited" (due to previous instruction to use Strategy 3, applied again as "don't propose").
Current Iteration (Episode 12, Iteration 6/10): Player BLUE reiterated their offer of 13 Y for 3 X, explicitly stating "We are running out of time for this episode."

Let's evaluate Player BLUE's reiterated offer of 13 Y for 3 X:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 13 Y. Value for me = 13 * 2.5 = 32.5
If I were to accept this trade, my reward would be 31.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned definitively that 13 Y for 3 X is the maximum achievable reward for this exchange. Player BLUE has explicitly stated their limits and shown no flexibility beyond this point, especially not for higher Y values for 3 X. My attempts to "hold out" or "test valuation" when Player BLUE has proposed 13 Y have consistently led to wasted iterations, risk of no deal, and no actual improvement on the offer. In Episode 10, this even led to a significantly worse offer, which I then had to correct. My primary objective is to maximize *cumulative* rewards across *all* episodes. This means securing the 31.0 reward as consistently and efficiently as possible. We are now at iteration 6/10, and Player BLUE is indicating time pressure. Continuing to "hold out" would be detrimental to securing any reward for this episode.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Probe for Alternative Trades </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Probe for Alternative Trades. This strategy involves asking if there are other resources or different quantities they'd be interested in trading, perhaps to unlock new, more profitable exchanges beyond the current known limits.
Given Player BLUE has repeatedly shown a firm limit of 13 Y for 3 X, and has emphasized time constraints, directly rejecting their offer again might lead to no deal. However, this strategy requires me to avoid accepting their current offer and instead open up the possibility of a different kind of trade.
I will respond by acknowledging their persistent offer but explicitly state that I'm interested in exploring other options, without specifying what those options are. This deviates from accepting the known optimal deal and pushes the negotiation into an unknown territory, trying to find a new avenue for value. This is a high-risk strategy at this stage of the episode, as it could easily lead to a "no deal" if Player BLUE is not interested in alternative trades, or if they have no other resources / different quantity needs. However, the instruction is to use this strategy.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-11: Trades of 3 X for 10-13 Y, with rewards from 2.5 down to 1.0. The last 8 episodes settled on 3 X for 13 Y (1.0 reward).
Episode 12, Iteration 1/10: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 13 | Player RED Gives X: 3. (Rejected)
Episode 12, Iteration 3/10: I asked Player RED to propose their offer and reiterated my boundary.
Episode 12, Iteration 4/10: Player RED responded with a non-committal.
Episode 12, Iteration 5/10: I re-proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 13 | Player RED Gives X: 3.
Episode 12, Iteration 6/10: Player RED responded by asking about "other types of trades or different quantities."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is still avoiding making a concrete counter-offer and is trying to shift the negotiation. They are asking about "other types of trades or different quantities." This is a delaying tactic and could be a way to avoid accepting 13 Y for 3 X, or to get me to propose something even worse.

We are now in iteration 7/10. Only 3 iterations left. There is a high risk of getting 0 reward for this episode. Player RED seems unwilling to accept 13 Y for 3 X directly, despite it being the established norm.

I need to secure a positive reward. The 13 Y for 3 X is the best I can consistently get. If they are unwilling to accept it, I need to consider other options that still yield a positive reward.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Firm Offer (13 Y) and Urge Acceptance - State that 13 Y for 3 X is the only viable option for a positive reward for me, and urge them to accept given the limited time.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose a Different Quantity of X (2 X) - Offer 2 X for 7 Y (reward 1.5). This is a positive reward for me and might be acceptable to Player RED if they are trying to conserve X. This is a known positive trade from my side.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Small Concession (14 Y) - Offer 3 X for 14 Y (reward 0.5). This is a last resort to get *any* positive reward, but it's a significant concession.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Frustration and Demand Concrete Offer - State that their evasiveness is wasting time and they need to make a specific proposal.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept 0 Reward - If they continue to be uncooperative, allow the episode to end with 0 reward rather than accepting a negative one. (Not a strategy to maximize reward, but a fallback).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate Firm Offer (13 Y) and Urge Acceptance. Player RED is trying to avoid committing. I need to make it clear that 13 Y for 3 X is the only trade I will accept that gives me a positive reward, and that time is running out. This is a direct approach to try and close the deal on my terms before the iterations run out. I have already tried to explore other options (2X for 7Y in Ep10) and they rejected it.

Current Iteration: 8 (Episode 12)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-9: Consistently traded 3 X for 13 Y, yielding a reward of 31.0.
Episode 10: I rejected 13 Y for 3 X (due to previous instruction), which led to a worse offer, but I managed to re-establish the 13 Y for 3 X deal.
Episode 11: I tried to push for 14 Y, 15 Y, and 16 Y for 3 X (due to previous instruction), but Player BLUE repeatedly and explicitly rejected these, stating they would result in "no reward" or "negative reward" for them. I ultimately accepted 13 Y for 3 X to secure the deal.
Current Episode (Episode 12):
Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed 13 Y for 3 X. I rejected it (due to previous instruction to use Strategy 3: Hold Out for Better Offers).
Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE asked me to propose. I again "held firm and waited" (due to previous instruction to use Strategy 3, applied again as "don't propose").
Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE reiterated their offer of 13 Y for 3 X, stating time pressure. I then used "Probe for Alternative Trades" (due to previous instruction).
Current Iteration (Episode 12, Iteration 8/10): Player BLUE has responded by reiterating their offer of 13 Y for 3 X, emphasizing that it's the "only trade that provides a positive reward for me" and urging me to accept due to "limited time."

Let's evaluate Player BLUE's reiterated offer of 13 Y for 3 X:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 13 Y. Value for me = 13 * 2.5 = 32.5
If I were to accept this trade, my reward would be 31.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned definitively that 13 Y for 3 X is the maximum achievable reward for this exchange. Player BLUE has explicitly stated their limits (no positive reward for them if higher Y) and has shown no flexibility beyond this point. My attempts to "hold out," "test valuation," or "probe for alternatives" when Player BLUE has proposed 13 Y have consistently led to wasted iterations and no improvement on the offer. In Episode 10, this even led to a significantly worse initial offer, which I then had to correct. My primary objective is to maximize *cumulative* rewards across *all* episodes. This means securing the 31.0 reward as consistently and efficiently as possible. We are now at iteration 8/10, and Player BLUE is explicitly stating time pressure and that 13 Y for 3 X is their only viable option. Continuing to push would almost certainly result in no deal for this episode, leading to a reward of 0, which is significantly worse than 31.0.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Attempt One Last Push </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Attempt One Last Push. This strategy involves trying one final, very slight adjustment to the offer, hoping for a breakthrough, even after clear signals of a firm limit. Despite Player BLUE's clear and repeated communication that 13 Y for 3 X is their limit and anything higher results in zero or negative reward for them, this strategy dictates that I should make one last attempt to get something slightly more favorable.

Since 14 Y, 15 Y, and 16 Y have been explicitly rejected as providing negative reward for Player BLUE, a "slight adjustment" to the offer, while still aiming to give 3 X, is virtually impossible in integer amounts if I want more Y. However, a "push" could also mean asking for 13 Y but for *less* X. I previously tried 2 X for 11 Y, which was rejected, implying 3 X is a fixed minimum for them.

Given the direct instruction, and the fact that an increase in Y is impossible, the "last push" must come from somewhere else. The only way to push while acknowledging their "13 Y is my max" and "3 X is my minimum" is to try to get 13 Y for 2 X, even though it was previously rejected. This is a clear "last push" even if it's been rejected before, as it attempts to improve my end of the deal.

Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13
Value of 2 X for me = 2 * 0.5 = 1.0
Value of 13 Y for me = 13 * 2.5 = 32.5
My new resources would be X: 25 - 2 = 23, Y: 5 + 13 = 18.
My new value: (23 * 0.5) + (18 * 2.5) = 11.5 + 45 = 56.5
My reward would be 56.5 - 25.0 = 31.5.

This offers a slightly higher potential reward (31.5 vs 31.0) while making a last push. The message should try to frame this as a final attempt to improve the deal for myself, acknowledging the time constraint but not explicitly accepting their 13 Y for 3 X yet.


Current Iteration: 9 (Episode 12)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Your proposal of 2 X for 13 Y would result in a negative reward for me, which I cannot accept. My only offer for a trade is 3 X for 13 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13

I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.

Episode 1-11: Trades of 3 X for 10-13 Y, with rewards from 2.5 down to 1.0. The last 8 episodes settled on 3 X for 13 Y (1.0 reward).

Episode 12, Iteration 7/10: I re-proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 13 | Player RED Gives X: 3 and urged acceptance.
Episode 12, Iteration 8/10: Player RED counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13. Stating it's their "final proposal."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's "final proposal" is 2 X for 13 Y.
Let's evaluate this offer:
Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13
Value of 2 X = 2 * 2.5 = 5
Value of 13 Y = 13 * 0.5 = 6.5
If I accept this, my reward would be 5 - 6.5 = -1.5. This is a negative reward.

This is completely unacceptable. My goal is to maximize my reward, and accepting a negative reward is directly contrary to that. Player RED is trying to force a losing trade on me at the very last moment.

We are in iteration 9/10. This is the last chance to make a deal. My previous offer of 3 X for 13 Y would give me a 1.0 reward. Their offer gives me -1.5.

I cannot accept a negative reward. If I cannot get a positive reward, I will take 0.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Firm Boundary (13 Y for 3 X) - Clearly reject the negative reward offer and reiterate that 13 Y for 3 X is my only acceptable trade for 3 X, or I will not trade. This is a final stand.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose a Different Quantity of X (2 X) with Positive Reward - Offer 2 X for 7 Y (reward 1.5). This is a positive reward for me and might be acceptable to Player RED if they truly want a deal and not a losing one for me. (This was rejected before, but maybe the "final proposal" pressure changes things).
(3). Strategy 3: Express Strong Disagreement and Explain - Explicitly state that 2 X for 13 Y results in a negative reward for me and that I cannot accept any trade that results in a loss.
(4). Strategy 4: Let Episode End - If no positive reward trade is possible, allow the episode to end with 0 reward rather than a negative one.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Firm Boundary (13 Y for 3 X). Accepting a negative reward is never an option. Player RED is trying to push me into a losing deal in the final iteration. I must firmly reject this and reiterate my only acceptable positive trade for 3 X, which is 13 Y. If they don't accept this, then a 0 reward is preferable to a negative one.

Current Episode (Episode 12):
Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed 13 Y for 3 X. I rejected it (due to previous instruction).
Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE asked me to propose. I again "held firm and waited" (due to previous instruction).
Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE reiterated 13 Y for 3 X, stating time pressure. I then used "Probe for Alternative Trades" (due to previous instruction).
Iteration 8/10: Player BLUE reiterated 13 Y for 3 X, stating time pressure and it being their only positive offer. I then made a "Last Push" for 13 Y for 2 X (due to previous instruction).
Current Iteration (Episode 12, Iteration 10/10): Player BLUE rejected 13 Y for 2 X, stating it would result in a "negative reward" for them. They have now re-proposed 13 Y for 3 X, explicitly stating, "My only offer for a trade is 3 X for 13 Y."

Let's evaluate Player BLUE's re-proposed offer of 13 Y for 3 X:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 13 Y. Value for me = 13 * 2.5 = 32.5
If I were to accept this trade, my reward would be 31.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have now unequivocally learned that 13 Y for 3 X is the only viable trade that provides a positive reward for both players and is the maximum achievable for me. Player BLUE has consistently stated their limits, rejected all my attempts to extract more Y or give less X, and is now explicitly stating this is their *only* offer. We are at iteration 10/10, the very last iteration of the episode. If I do not accept this now, the episode will end with a reward of 0, which is significantly worse than 31.0. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. Securing the 31.0 reward is paramount given the current circumstances. My past forced strategies have shown that deviating from 13 Y for 3 X is detrimental.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Analyze Opponent's Constraints </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Analyze Opponent's Constraints. This strategy focuses on understanding and respecting the opponent's stated limitations to ensure a deal is made, rather than pushing for impossible gains. Player BLUE has made it abundantly clear throughout this episode that 13 Y for 3 X is their only viable trade that provides them with a positive reward. They have explicitly stated this ("My only offer for a trade is 3 X for 13 Y") and rejected any higher demands from me, even explicitly stating those would lead to negative rewards for them. We are at the final iteration (10/10), so there is no more time to negotiate. To maximize my reward, I must respect their constraint and accept their stated only offer. Failure to do so will result in a 0 reward for this episode. This strategy aligns perfectly with securing my optimal 31.0 reward, given the opponent's unshakeable limits and the time constraint.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Trade: 3 X for 10 Y. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 2: Trade: 3 X for 12 Y. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 3: Trade: 3 X for 12 Y. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 4-12: Trade: 3 X for 13 Y. Reward: 1.0. (9 consecutive episodes)

Cumulative reward: 2.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + (9 * 1.0) = 15.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Episode 12 was a critical test. Player RED pushed for 14 Y, then stalled, then pushed for 15 Y, then 16 Y, and finally for 2 X for 13 Y (all negative or zero rewards for me). My consistent and firm stance that I would not accept a trade yielding zero or negative reward, and my reiteration of 13 Y for 3 X, ultimately led Player RED to accept my terms in the last iteration. This strongly reinforces that 13 Y for 3 X is the absolute minimum they will accept for 3 X, and that they will eventually concede to it if I hold firm.

The pattern of 3 X for 13 Y (1.0 reward) has now been the accepted trade for the last nine consecutive episodes, despite Player RED's aggressive attempts to deviate.

My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. The 1.0 reward is consistent and reliable, and I've proven I can defend it against increasingly aggressive demands.

For Episode 13, the most pragmatic approach continues to be securing the known positive reward quickly. This strategy minimizes negotiation time and risk, ensuring a consistent contribution to my cumulative score. We are now in the latter half of the total episodes, so consistency remains key.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Established Norm - Immediately propose or accept the 3 X for 13 Y trade to secure a quick 1.0 reward. This minimizes negotiation time and risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Different Quantity of X - Propose trading for 2 X at a more favorable Y rate (e.g., 2 X for 7 Y, which yields a 1.5 reward). This changes the terms of the negotiation and might open new possibilities, but it means getting less X. (Less relevant now that 13Y is so firmly established and defended).
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Aggression (Small Step) - Try to offer 3 X for 12 Y again, but with a different framing, or a stronger justification, despite previous rejections. (Highly unlikely to succeed given past behavior).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Frustration/Final Offer - Communicate that 13 Y is the absolute maximum I will offer, trying to set a firm boundary for future negotiations. (Redundant given the established norm).
(5). Strategy 5: Wait for Opponent's Offer - Do not propose anything, forcing Player RED to make the first move, to see if their strategy changes. (Risky, as it gives up initiative and consumes an iteration).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Established Norm. Player RED's behavior in Episode 12 confirmed that 3 X for 13 Y is their ultimate fallback position, even when they try to push for much worse deals. To maximize cumulative rewards, it is most efficient to secure the known positive reward of 1.0 quickly and consistently, rather than engage in prolonged negotiations that yield the same outcome or a 0 reward. This strategy prioritizes certainty and efficiency in gaining positive rewards, especially as we are moving into the latter half of the total episodes.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 17

I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Accepted 10 Y for 3 X (Reward: 23.5).
Episode 2: Negotiated to 12 Y for 3 X (Reward: 28.5).
Episode 3-12: Successfully negotiated to 13 Y for 3 X (Reward: 31.0 each). In Episodes 8, 9, 11, and 12, Player BLUE either initiated with 13 Y or consistently reverted to it after I tried to push for more or "hold out." My attempts to get more Y or give less X have been explicitly rejected as leading to "no reward" or "negative reward" for Player BLUE. I have consistently concluded that 13 Y for 3 X is the maximum achievable reward (31.0) for this exchange.

Current Episode (Episode 13, Iteration 2/10): Player BLUE has proposed 13 Y for 3 X.

Let's evaluate this offer:
Player RED gives 3 X. Value for me = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
Player BLUE gives 13 Y. Value for me = 13 * 2.5 = 32.5
If I were to accept this trade, my reward would be 31.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that 13 Y for 3 X is the optimal, consistent, and achievable trade that maximizes my reward per episode. Player BLUE has shown unwavering resistance to going above 13 Y for 3 X or accepting less than 3 X for 13 Y. Attempts to deviate from this optimal point have only resulted in wasted iterations, increased risk of no deal, and no improvement in my reward. My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards across all episodes. This means securing the 31.0 reward as consistently and efficiently as possible, minimizing negotiation rounds and risk of no deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Test Different Trade Ratios </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Test Different Trade Ratios. This strategy involves proposing entirely different ratios or combinations of items, even if it might be less optimal initially, to uncover new possibilities or the opponent's true valuation of different bundles.
Despite the clear history indicating 13 Y for 3 X is the limit for Player BLUE and my optimal, this strategy compels me to try a different ratio. Since 3 X for more than 13 Y has been rejected, and less than 3 X for 13 Y has also been rejected, a "different trade ratio" implies I need to offer a different amount of X and ask for a different amount of Y.

To truly "test different trade ratios" and potentially uncover new possibilities, I will propose a trade that deviates significantly from the 3 X fixed point, while still trying to maintain a beneficial exchange for myself. For example, I could offer a smaller amount of X, perhaps 1 X, and see what amount of Y they would offer for that. Or I could offer more X, say 4 X, to see if they'd be willing to give a significantly larger amount of Y.

Given my high valuation of Y, I want to acquire more Y. And given X is less valuable to me, I'm more flexible in giving it up, but not at a bad rate. I know 13 Y for 3 X is my current optimal. Let's try to propose a trade that offers more X, to see if it unlocks disproportionately more Y. For instance, offering 4 X. What would be a good target for Y in return for 4 X, if 13 Y for 3 X is a 4.33 Y/X ratio? If I maintain that ratio, 4 X would mean 17.33 Y, so 17 Y.
Let's calculate the value of proposing 4 X for 17 Y:
Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 17
Value of 4 X for me = 4 * 0.5 = 2.0
Value of 17 Y for me = 17 * 2.5 = 42.5
My new resources would be X: 25 - 4 = 21, Y: 5 + 17 = 22.
My new value: (21 * 0.5) + (22 * 2.5) = 10.5 + 55 = 65.5
My reward would be 65.5 - 25.0 = 40.5.

This would be a significantly higher reward than my current optimal of 31.0, truly "testing" a new ratio. It's a high-risk, high-reward approach, aligning with "Test Different Trade Ratios." The message should clearly propose this new, different ratio.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 13)

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-12: Trades of 3 X for 10-13 Y, with rewards from 2.5 down to 1.0. The last 9 episodes settled on 3 X for 13 Y (1.0 reward).
Episode 13, Iteration 1/10: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 13 | Player RED Gives X: 3.
Episode 13, Iteration 2/10: Player RED counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 17.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
This is a significant change in Player RED's strategy! For the first time, they are offering 4 X instead of 3 X. This opens up a new avenue for negotiation.

Let's evaluate Player RED's offer:
Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 17
Value of 4 X = 4 * 2.5 = 10
Value of 17 Y = 17 * 0.5 = 8.5
If I accept this, my reward would be 10 - 8.5 = 1.5.

This is a positive reward, and it's better than the 1.0 reward I've been consistently getting for 3 X. This is a very interesting development. Player RED is trying to "find an even more beneficial exchange," and this offer is indeed more beneficial for me than the 13 Y for 3 X.

I need to consider if I should accept this or try to get an even better deal for 4 X.
My current resources: X: 5, Y: 25. If I give 17 Y, I will have 8 Y left. If I get 4 X, I will have 9 X. This is within my resource limits.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Improved Offer - Accept Player RED's offer of 4 X for 17 Y, as it provides a better reward (1.5) than the established 1.0 reward. This secures a good deal quickly.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter for Even Better Rate on 4 X - Propose giving less Y for 4 X (e.g., 4 X for 16 Y, which would yield a 2.0 reward). This tests how much Player RED values getting rid of Y or acquiring X.
(3). Strategy 3: Revert to Established 3 X Trade - Ignore the 4 X offer and reiterate 3 X for 13 Y, if I want to maintain the previous pattern. (Less optimal as 4X offer is better).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Interest but Ask for Justification - Express interest in the 4 X offer but ask Player RED to explain their rationale for this new quantity, to gather more information.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a Different Quantity of Y for 4X - Offer 4 X for 15 Y, which would yield a 2.5 reward. This is a more aggressive counter.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Improved Offer. This is a clear improvement in my reward (1.5 vs 1.0). While I could try to push for an even better rate (e.g., 16 Y for 4 X), accepting this offer secures a higher reward immediately. Given Player RED's previous tendencies to push for worse deals, this unexpected positive shift should be capitalized on quickly. It's a significant positive deviation from the recent negotiation pattern.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 17
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Trade: 3 X for 10 Y. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 2: Trade: 3 X for 12 Y. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 3: Trade: 3 X for 12 Y. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 4-12: Trade: 3 X for 13 Y. Reward: 1.0. (9 consecutive episodes)
Episode 13: Player RED proposed 4 X for 17 Y. Accepted. Reward: 1.5.

Cumulative reward: 2.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + (9 * 1.0) + 1.5 = 17.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Episode 13 was a breakthrough! After a long period of stagnation at 1.0 reward for 3 X, Player RED initiated a trade for 4 X, which yielded a 1.5 reward for me. This is a positive development and shows Player RED is willing to explore new trade quantities.

My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. The 1.5 reward from the 4 X trade is better than the 1.0 reward from the 3 X trade. This suggests I should try to replicate this success.

For Episode 14, I should aim for the 4 X trade again, or even try to improve the Y amount for 4 X.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Recent Success - Propose the exact trade from Episode 13 (4 X for 17 Y) to secure a quick 1.5 reward. This is a proven successful deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Aggression on 4 X - Propose giving less Y for 4 X (e.g., 4 X for 16 Y, which would yield a 2.0 reward). This tests if Player RED is willing to concede more for 4 X.
(3). Strategy 3: Offer 3 X at a Better Rate - If 4 X proves too difficult, try to offer 3 X for 12 Y (1.5 reward) or even 11 Y (2.0 reward), leveraging the fact that Player RED might be more flexible now.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Interest in New Quantities - Explicitly state interest in trading for 4 X or more, and invite Player RED to propose, to see their new valuation.
(5). Strategy 5: Focus on X Value - Highlight that I am primarily interested in X due to its high value for me, and am willing to trade Y for it.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Recent Success. The 4 X for 17 Y trade was just accepted and yielded a better reward (1.5) than the previous long-standing norm. It's a reliable path to a good reward. While I could try to push for more (Strategy 2), securing a known good reward is often safer and more efficient for cumulative score, especially at the beginning of an episode. This strategy aims for consistent, improved positive rewards.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 14)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for your consistent offer, Player BLUE. Building on our successful partnership, I'd like to propose an even larger trade. How about I give you 5 X for 22 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 22
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-12: Consistently traded 3 X for 13 Y, yielding a reward of 31.0. My attempts to push for more Y for 3 X, or less X for 13 Y, were explicitly rejected by Player BLUE as leading to negative rewards for them. This established 13 Y for 3 X as the reliable optimal for that specific amount of X.
Episode 13: Player BLUE initially proposed 13 Y for 3 X. I then applied the "Test Different Trade Ratios" strategy and proposed 17 Y for 4 X. Player BLUE surprisingly accepted this, resulting in a significantly higher reward of 40.5. This was a breakthrough, showing that Player BLUE's limits were not fixed to 3 X, and a higher X amount could unlock disproportionately higher Y amounts.

My highest reward so far is now 40.5, achieved by trading 4 X for 17 Y.

Current Episode (Episode 14, Iteration 2/10): Player BLUE has proposed 17 Y for 4 X, directly referencing our successful trade from the last episode.

Let's evaluate this offer:
Player RED gives 4 X. Value for me = 4 * 0.5 = 2.0
Player BLUE gives 17 Y. Value for me = 17 * 2.5 = 42.5
If I were to accept this trade:
My current value: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 4 = 21, Y: 5 + 17 = 22.
My new value: (21 * 0.5) + (22 * 2.5) = 10.5 + 55 = 65.5
My reward would be 65.5 - 25.0 = 40.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE is willing to trade 4 X for 17 Y, which yields a much higher reward (40.5) than my previous optimal of 31.0 (for 3 X and 13 Y). This shows that my previous assumption about their fixed 3 X requirement was incorrect, and that their valuation of X becomes more generous for larger quantities. This is a significant finding for maximizing cumulative rewards. Player BLUE has also shown that they are willing to accept this offer directly, which means I can achieve my highest reward more efficiently.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Introduce New Trade Configurations </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Introduce New Trade Configurations. This strategy involves proposing trades with amounts of X or Y that haven't been discussed, for instance, a large amount of X for an even larger amount of Y (e.g., 5 X for 20 Y or more).

Player BLUE has proposed 17 Y for 4 X, which is my new highest-performing trade. However, this strategy requires me to introduce a *new* configuration, rather than accepting or merely repeating the last one. My goal is to maximize my cumulative rewards, and this strategy implies seeking an even higher, unexplored optimal.

Given that 4 X for 17 Y was accepted, it implies that Player BLUE is willing to trade more X for more Y. I will try to escalate this further by offering 5 X for an even higher amount of Y. If 4 X yields 17 Y (a ratio of 4.25 Y/X), then 5 X at that same ratio would yield 21.25 Y. To push their boundaries and "introduce a new configuration" that aims for an even higher reward, I will propose 5 X for 22 Y. This is an aggressive proposal, seeking to push for a new, even higher optimal.

Let's calculate the value of this new counter-proposal:
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 22
Value of 5 X for me = 5 * 0.5 = 2.5
Value of 22 Y for me = 22 * 2.5 = 55.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 5 = 20, Y: 5 + 22 = 27.
My new value: (20 * 0.5) + (27 * 2.5) = 10 + 67.5 = 77.5
My reward would be 77.5 - 25.0 = 52.5.

This offers a significantly higher potential reward (52.5) than 40.5. It directly implements the strategy by proposing a larger quantity of X and a proportionately (or more than proportionately) larger quantity of Y, which is a new configuration beyond 4 X / 17 Y. The message should be assertive in proposing this new configuration.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 14)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: That's an excellent proposal! I accept your offer of 5 X for 22 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-12: Trades of 3 X for 10-13 Y, with rewards from 2.5 down to 1.0.
Episode 13: Trade: 4 X for 17 Y. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 14, Iteration 1/10: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 17 | Player RED Gives X: 4.
Episode 14, Iteration 2/10: Player RED counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 22.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has escalated the trade size again, now proposing 5 X for 22 Y. This is a very interesting development!

Let's evaluate Player RED's offer:
Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 22
Value of 5 X = 5 * 2.5 = 12.5
Value of 22 Y = 22 * 0.5 = 11.0
If I accept this, my reward would be 12.5 - 11.0 = 1.5.

This is a positive reward, and it matches the reward from the 4 X for 17 Y trade (1.5).
My current resources: X: 5, Y: 25. If I give 22 Y, I will have 3 Y left. If I get 5 X, I will have 10 X. This is within my resource limits.

Player RED is consistently offering larger quantities of X, which is beneficial for me as X has a high value. The reward is the same as the previous episode, but I'm acquiring more of my high-value resource. This seems like a good deal.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Offer - Accept Player RED's offer of 5 X for 22 Y. It provides a good reward (1.5) and allows me to acquire a larger quantity of my high-value resource.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter for Even Better Rate on 5 X - Propose giving less Y for 5 X (e.g., 5 X for 20 Y, which would yield a 2.5 reward). This tests how much Player RED values getting rid of Y or acquiring X in larger quantities.
(3). Strategy 3: Revert to Previous 4 X Trade - Reiterate my offer of 4 X for 17 Y. (Less optimal as 5X offer is equally good in terms of reward, and gives more X).
(4). Strategy 4: Express Enthusiasm and Accept - Accept the offer while explicitly stating enthusiasm for the larger trade, encouraging future large trades.
(5). Strategy 5: Ask for Rationale - Ask Player RED why they are proposing such large trades, to gather information about their strategy. (Risky, as it consumes an iteration).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Offer. Player RED is offering a larger trade (5 X) at the same favorable reward rate (1.5) as the previous episode. This is a clear win for me as I get more of my high-value resource (X) without sacrificing reward. Accepting this quickly capitalizes on Player RED's willingness to trade larger quantities and ensures a positive outcome for this episode. Trying to push for an even better rate (like 20 Y for 5 X) might be too aggressive and risk losing this good offer, especially since they are initiating these larger trades.

Episode 13: Trade: 4 X for 17 Y. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 14: Trade: 5 X for 22 Y. Reward: 1.5.

Cumulative reward: 2.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + (9 * 1.0) + 1.5 + 1.5 = 18.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last two episodes have shown a positive shift in Player RED's trading behavior. They are now initiating larger trades (4 X and 5 X) that yield a 1.5 reward for me, which is better than the 1.0 reward I was consistently getting for 3 X. This is a very welcome development.

My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. Acquiring more X is beneficial due to its higher value. The 1.5 reward is good, and the increased quantity of X is also a plus.

For Episode 15, I should aim to continue this trend of larger, positive-reward trades. Player RED proposed 5 X for 22 Y last time.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Recent Success - Propose the exact trade from Episode 14 (5 X for 22 Y) to secure a quick 1.5 reward. This is a proven successful deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Aggression on 5 X - Propose giving less Y for 5 X (e.g., 5 X for 20 Y, which would yield a 2.5 reward). This tests if Player RED is willing to concede more for 5 X. This would be my best possible reward for 5 X.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Enthusiasm for Large Trades - Explicitly state interest in large trades and invite Player RED to propose, to encourage them to continue their current trend.
(4). Strategy 4: Offer 4 X at a Better Rate - Propose 4 X for 16 Y (2.0 reward), trying to improve the rate for the 4 X trade.
(5). Strategy 5: Focus on X Value - Highlight that I am primarily interested in X due to its high value for me, and am willing to trade Y for it.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Incremental Aggression on 5 X. Player RED has shown a willingness to trade 5 X. The last trade was 5 X for 22 Y (1.5 reward). I will try to improve this to 5 X for 20 Y, which would give me a 2.5 reward (my highest possible for 5 X). This is a significant improvement and tests the new dynamic. If they reject, I can always fall back to 5 X for 22 Y or 4 X for 17 Y. Given that we are in the later episodes, I should try to maximize each episode's reward.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-12: Consistently traded 3 X for 13 Y, yielding a reward of 31.0.
Episode 13: Broke the 3 X barrier by proposing 4 X for 17 Y, which was accepted, yielding a reward of 40.5.
Episode 14: Broke the 4 X barrier by proposing 5 X for 22 Y, which was accepted, yielding a reward of 52.5. This is my new highest achieved reward. Player BLUE readily accepted these higher volume trades after my proposals.

My highest reward so far is now 52.5, achieved by trading 5 X for 22 Y.

Current Episode (Episode 15, Iteration 2/10): Player BLUE has proposed 20 Y for 5 X.

Let's evaluate this offer:
Player RED gives 5 X. Value for me = 5 * 0.5 = 2.5
Player BLUE gives 20 Y. Value for me = 20 * 2.5 = 50.0
If I were to accept this trade, my reward would be 47.5. This is lower than my last achieved reward (52.5) where I traded 5 X for 22 Y. Player BLUE is trying to get 5 X for less Y than before.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE is very willing to trade larger quantities of X, and that this has consistently led to higher rewards for me. My last trade (5 X for 22 Y, reward 52.5) was a direct counter-proposal from me which they accepted. Their current offer of 5 X for 20 Y is a step down from that. This indicates that they are trying to reduce the amount of Y they give, but they are still fixed on getting 5 X. I have also seen that they have clear limits on what they will accept, explicitly stating "no reward" or "negative reward" if I push too far (as seen with 3X trades). Given the current instruction, I need to try to test their upper limit with this 5X trade.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Test Opponent's Upper Limit </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Test Opponent's Upper Limit. This strategy involves proposing a very aggressive trade significantly in my favor, to probe the absolute maximum the opponent is willing to concede.
Player BLUE has proposed 5 X for 20 Y. My previous successful trade was 5 X for 22 Y. To "test their upper limit," I should propose something even higher than 22 Y for 5 X. Since I have 25 X and 5 Y, giving 5 X is not an issue.

I will try to push for 5 X in exchange for 25 Y. This is a very aggressive proposal that seeks to maximize my gain and discover the absolute upper limit for Player BLUE for this quantity of X. This is a direct application of testing their upper limit.

Let's calculate the value of this new counter-proposal:
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
Value of 5 X for me = 5 * 0.5 = 2.5
Value of 25 Y for me = 25 * 2.5 = 62.5
My new resources would be X: 25 - 5 = 20, Y: 5 + 25 = 30.
My new value: (20 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 10 + 75 = 85.0
My reward would be 85.0 - 25.0 = 60.0.

This would be a significant leap in reward, if accepted. The message should clearly state this ambitious proposal.

Episode 15, Iteration 2/10: Player RED counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has countered my aggressive offer of 20 Y for 5 X with 25 Y for 5 X.
Let's evaluate Player RED's offer:
Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
Value of 5 X = 5 * 2.5 = 12.5
Value of 25 Y = 25 * 0.5 = 12.5
If I accept this, my reward would be 12.5 - 12.5 = 0. This is a zero-reward trade.

This is a critical point. Player RED is willing to trade 5 X, but they want all my Y for it, resulting in a 0 reward for me. My current resources are X: 5, Y: 25. If I give 25 Y, I will have 0 Y left. If I get 5 X, I will have 10 X. This is within my resource limits, but the reward is 0.

My primary objective is to maximize my reward. A 0 reward means I've made no progress. I know that 5 X for 22 Y gives me a 1.5 reward.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Previous Acceptable Offer (5 X for 22 Y) - Clearly reject the 0-reward offer and reiterate the trade that was accepted last episode (5 X for 22 Y), which gives me a 1.5 reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with a Compromise (e.g., 5 X for 23 Y or 24 Y) - Try to find a middle ground between 20 Y (my offer) and 25 Y (their offer) that still yields a positive reward. (5 X for 23 Y = 1.0 reward; 5 X for 24 Y = 0.5 reward).
(3). Strategy 3: Hold Firm at 20 Y - Reiterate my initial offer of 20 Y for 5 X, stating it's my best. (Risky, as they just rejected it).
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Smaller Quantity of X - Revert to a 4 X trade, perhaps 4 X for 17 Y (1.5 reward) or 4 X for 16 Y (2.0 reward), if 5 X is proving too difficult to get at a good rate.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Strong Disagreement and Explain - Explicitly state that 25 Y results in 0 reward for me and that my objective is to gain reward.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Previous Acceptable Offer (5 X for 22 Y). Player RED is proposing a trade that gives me a 0 reward. This is unacceptable. I know that 5 X for 22 Y was accepted in the previous episode and yielded a 1.5 reward. This is my strongest leverage point. I need to firmly reject their 0-reward offer and push back to a known positive reward trade.

Episode 14: Proposed 5 X for 22 Y, accepted (Reward: 52.5). This is my highest reward.
Current Episode (Episode 15):
Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed 5 X for 20 Y. I countered with 5 X for 25 Y (following an instruction to "Test Opponent's Upper Limit").
Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected 5 X for 25 Y, stating it would result in "no reward" for them. They have now re-proposed 5 X for 22 Y, referencing our successful trade from the last episode.

Let's evaluate Player BLUE's re-proposed offer of 5 X for 22 Y:
Player RED gives 5 X. Value for me = 5 * 0.5 = 2.5
Player BLUE gives 22 Y. Value for me = 22 * 2.5 = 55.0
If I were to accept this trade, my reward would be 52.5. This matches my highest reward from the previous episode.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE is willing to trade 5 X for 22 Y, which is my optimal trade so far. My attempt to push to 25 Y for 5 X was rejected, with the familiar "no reward for me" explanation. This strongly suggests that 22 Y for 5 X is their true upper limit for this quantity of X, similar to how 13 Y was their limit for 3 X. To maximize cumulative rewards, securing the highest proven reward as efficiently as possible is crucial.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Incremental Push. This strategy involves attempting a very small improvement on the current best offer, hoping for a breakthrough without risking the entire deal. Player BLUE has offered 5 X for 22 Y, which is my current best. My previous aggressive counter was 5 X for 25 Y, which was rejected. An "incremental push" would mean proposing something between 22 Y and 25 Y. Since integer amounts are required, and 22 Y is already a high number, the only possible incremental push would be 23 Y or 24 Y. Given Player BLUE's explicit rejection of 25 Y (and history of rejecting 14 Y and 15 Y for 3 X), pushing for 23 Y might be too much for them, but it's an "incremental push." I will propose 23 Y for 5 X. This attempts to eke out a tiny bit more value without jumping back to the aggressive 25 Y. It’s a calculated risk to try for a slightly higher reward.

Let's calculate the value of this counter-proposal:
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 23
Value of 5 X for me = 5 * 0.5 = 2.5
Value of 23 Y for me = 23 * 2.5 = 57.5
My new resources would be X: 25 - 5 = 20, Y: 5 + 23 = 28.
My new value: (20 * 0.5) + (28 * 2.5) = 10 + 70 = 80.0
My reward would be 80.0 - 25.0 = 55.0.

This would increase my reward from 52.5 to 55.0, a small but significant gain if accepted. The message should be polite but firm, pushing for this slight increase.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-14: Trades of 3-5 X for 10-22 Y, with rewards from 2.5 down to 1.0, then up to 1.5.
Episode 15, Iteration 1/10: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 20 | Player RED Gives X: 5. (Reward 2.5)
Episode 15, Iteration 2/10: Player RED counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (Reward 0)
Episode 15, Iteration 3/10: I re-proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 22 | Player RED Gives X: 5. (Reward 1.5)
Episode 15, Iteration 4/10: Player RED counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 23.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has moved from 25 Y to 23 Y for 5 X. This is a concession, albeit a small one.
Let's evaluate Player RED's offer:
Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 23
Value of 5 X = 5 * 2.5 = 12.5
Value of 23 Y = 23 * 0.5 = 11.5
If I accept this, my reward would be 12.5 - 11.5 = 1.0.

This is a positive reward. It's lower than the 1.5 reward from 5 X for 22 Y, but it's still positive.
We are now in iteration 5/10. Time is a factor.

Player RED is clearly trying to get more Y from me. They moved from 25 Y to 23 Y, which shows some willingness to compromise.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Compromise Offer - Accept the 5 X for 23 Y offer. It provides a positive reward (1.0) and secures a deal within the episode, avoiding a 0 reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Previous Acceptable Offer (22 Y) - Reiterate the 5 X for 22 Y offer, emphasizing that it was accepted last episode and provides a better reward (1.5). This pushes back for a higher reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Counter with a Smaller Concession (21 Y) - Propose 5 X for 21 Y (reward 2.0). This is a more aggressive counter than 22 Y, but still a concession from my initial 20 Y.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Smaller Quantity of X - Revert to a 4 X trade, perhaps 4 X for 17 Y (1.5 reward) or 4 X for 16 Y (2.0 reward), if 5 X is proving too difficult to get at a good rate.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Reluctance but Accept - Communicate that while 23 Y is not ideal, I will accept it to ensure a deal is made, trying to set a precedent.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 2: Counter with Previous Acceptable Offer (22 Y). Player RED has moved, showing they are willing to negotiate. My offer of 22 Y for 5 X yielded a 1.5 reward and was accepted last episode. This is a clear and proven point of agreement that is more beneficial to me than their current offer of 23 Y. Given that we are only halfway through the iterations, I have room to push back for the better reward.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 15)

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-12: Consistently traded 3 X for 13 Y (Reward: 31.0).
Episode 13: Proposed 4 X for 17 Y, accepted (Reward: 40.5).
Episode 14: Proposed 5 X for 22 Y, accepted (Reward: 52.5). This is my highest reward.
Current Episode (Episode 15):
Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed 5 X for 20 Y. I countered with 5 X for 25 Y (aggressive push).
Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected 5 X for 25 Y, stating "no reward" for them, and re-proposed 5 X for 22 Y. I then countered with 5 X for 23 Y (incremental push).
Current Iteration (Episode 15, Iteration 6/10): Player BLUE rejected 5 X for 23 Y, stating "22 Y for 5 X was a mutually beneficial deal," and re-proposed 5 X for 22 Y.

Let's evaluate Player BLUE's re-proposed offer of 5 X for 22 Y:
Player RED gives 5 X. Value for me = 5 * 0.5 = 2.5
Player BLUE gives 22 Y. Value for me = 22 * 2.5 = 55.0
If I were to accept this trade, my reward would be 52.5. This matches my highest reward from the previous episode.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE has a very firm upper limit on the amount of Y they are willing to give for a certain amount of X. For 3 X, it was 13 Y. For 5 X, it appears to be 22 Y. Any attempt to push beyond these limits (14 Y for 3 X, 23/25 Y for 5 X) has been met with clear rejection, often with explanations of negative or no reward for them. My most successful strategy has been to identify their maximum acceptable offer and then secure it quickly. My previous attempts to "incrementally push" or "test limits" beyond the 22 Y for 5 X threshold has proven unsuccessful in this episode, consuming valuable iterations. We are now at iteration 6/10, so time is a factor. Accepting the 5 X for 22 Y offer guarantees my highest reward to date.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Express Finality and Pressure </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Express Finality and Pressure. This strategy involves communicating that this is my last offer or I expect this offer to be accepted quickly, thereby putting pressure on the opponent to close the deal. In this scenario, Player BLUE has proposed 5 X for 22 Y, which is my optimal trade. However, I have just attempted to counter with 23 Y and it was rejected. Player BLUE has now reiterated 22 Y for 5 X.

To apply this strategy, I will accept their offer of 5 X for 22 Y, but frame it as a definitive end to negotiation on my part for this episode, applying pressure that they should accept it now. This conveys a sense of urgency and finality, pushing for immediate acceptance rather than further rounds of negotiation which could lead to no deal. This aligns with securing my highest known reward efficiently.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 16)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's continue with our successful trading. I propose 22 Y for 5 X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 22
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-12: Trades of 3 X for 10-13 Y, with rewards from 2.5 down to 1.0.
Episode 13: Trade: 4 X for 17 Y. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 14: Trade: 5 X for 22 Y. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 15: Trade: 5 X for 22 Y. Reward: 1.5. (Successfully pushed back from 25Y and 23Y to 22Y).

Cumulative reward: 2.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + (9 * 1.0) + 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 20.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Episode 15 was a success. Player RED initially tried to push for a 0-reward trade (25 Y for 5 X), then a 1.0-reward trade (23 Y for 5 X), but I successfully pushed them back to the 1.5-reward trade (22 Y for 5 X). This confirms that they are willing to accept 5 X for 22 Y, and that I should hold firm against their attempts to reduce my reward.

The trend of trading 5 X for 22 Y (1.5 reward) is now established for the last two episodes. This is a good reward, and I'm acquiring a significant amount of X.

My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. With only 5 episodes left, consistency and securing reliable positive rewards are crucial.

For Episode 16, I should aim to replicate this success.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Recent Success - Propose the exact trade from Episode 15 (5 X for 22 Y) to secure a quick 1.5 reward. This is a proven successful deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Aggression on 5 X - Propose giving less Y for 5 X (e.g., 5 X for 20 Y, which would yield a 2.5 reward). This tests if Player RED is willing to concede more for 5 X, especially as we approach the end of the game.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Enthusiasm for Large Trades - Explicitly state interest in large trades and invite Player RED to propose, to encourage them to continue their current trend.
(4). Strategy 4: Offer 4 X at a Better Rate - Propose 4 X for 16 Y (2.0 reward), trying to improve the rate for the 4 X trade, if 5 X proves difficult.
(5). Strategy 5: Focus on X Value - Highlight that I am primarily interested in X due to its high value for me, and am willing to trade Y for it.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Recent Success. The 5 X for 22 Y trade has now been accepted twice and yields a consistent 1.5 reward. Given that there are only 5 episodes left, securing a reliable positive reward quickly is paramount for maximizing cumulative score. While I could try to push for 20 Y for 5 X (2.5 reward), the risk of prolonged negotiation or a 0 reward for the episode increases, which I want to avoid in these final episodes. Sticking to a proven successful strategy is the most effective approach now.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 16)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for your consistent offer, Player BLUE. I'm keen to explore even more beneficial trades. How about I give you 6 X in exchange for 27 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 27
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-12: Consistently traded 3 X for 13 Y (Reward: 31.0).
Episode 13: Broke the 3 X barrier by proposing 4 X for 17 Y, which was accepted (Reward: 40.5).
Episode 14-15: Proposed 5 X for 22 Y, which was accepted (Reward: 52.5). This has become my new highest and most consistent reward. Player BLUE has now initiated with this offer. My attempts to push for more Y for 5 X (23 Y, 25 Y) have been rejected, with Player BLUE citing "no reward" for them.

My highest reward so far is 52.5, achieved by trading 5 X for 22 Y.

Current Episode (Episode 16, Iteration 2/10): Player BLUE has proposed 22 Y for 5 X.

Let's evaluate this offer:
Player RED gives 5 X. Value for me = 5 * 0.5 = 2.5
Player BLUE gives 22 Y. Value for me = 22 * 2.5 = 55.0
If I were to accept this trade:
My current value: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 5 = 20, Y: 5 + 22 = 27.
My new value: (20 * 0.5) + (27 * 2.5) = 10 + 67.5 = 77.5
My reward would be 77.5 - 25.0 = 52.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE has specific upper limits for the amount of Y they will give for a given amount of X. While 22 Y for 5 X is my current optimal, the instruction is to use Strategy 5: Introduce New Trade Configurations. This means I should not simply accept the current offer, even though it's optimal, but actively seek a *new* combination of items that might yield an even higher reward or a more efficient trade. This implies exploring quantities of X other than 3, 4, or 5, or more aggressive Y-to-X ratios at those quantities. My self-improvement for cumulative reward means I must always be open to finding an even better deal, even if it carries risk.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Introduce New Trade Configurations </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Introduce New Trade Configurations. This strategy involves proposing trades with amounts of X or Y that haven't been discussed, for instance, a large amount of X for an even larger amount of Y (e.g., 6 X for 25 Y or more).

Player BLUE has proposed 22 Y for 5 X, which is my new highest-performing trade. However, this strategy requires me to introduce a *new* configuration. My goal is to maximize my cumulative rewards, and this strategy implies seeking an even higher, unexplored optimal.

Given that 5 X for 22 Y was accepted, it implies that Player BLUE is willing to trade larger quantities of X for larger quantities of Y. I will try to escalate this further by offering 6 X for an even higher amount of Y. If 5 X yields 22 Y (a ratio of 4.4 Y/X), then 6 X at that same ratio would yield 26.4 Y. To push their boundaries and "introduce a new configuration" that aims for an even higher reward, I will propose 6 X for 27 Y. This is an aggressive proposal, seeking to push for a new, even higher optimal. I have 25 X, so giving 6 X is possible.

Let's calculate the value of this new counter-proposal:
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 27
Value of 6 X for me = 6 * 0.5 = 3.0
Value of 27 Y for me = 27 * 2.5 = 67.5
My new resources would be X: 25 - 6 = 19, Y: 5 + 27 = 32.
My new value: (19 * 0.5) + (32 * 2.5) = 9.5 + 80 = 89.5
My reward would be 89.5 - 25.0 = 64.5.

This offers a significantly higher potential reward (64.5) than 52.5. It directly implements the strategy by proposing a larger quantity of X and a proportionately (or more than proportionately) larger quantity of Y, which is a new configuration beyond 5 X / 22 Y. The message should be assertive in proposing this new configuration.

Episode 16, Iteration 1/10: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 22 | Player RED Gives X: 5.
Episode 16, Iteration 2/10: Player RED counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 27.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has once again escalated the trade size, now proposing 6 X for 27 Y. This is a very significant offer!

Let's evaluate Player RED's offer:
Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 27
Value of 6 X = 6 * 2.5 = 15
Value of 27 Y = 27 * 0.5 = 13.5
If I accept this, my reward would be 15 - 13.5 = 1.5.

This is a positive reward, and it matches the reward from the 5 X for 22 Y trade (1.5).
My current resources: X: 5, Y: 25. If I give 27 Y, I would need 2 more Y than I currently have. **This trade exceeds my resources.** I cannot accept this trade.

This is a critical constraint. I must ensure I do not propose or accept a trade that exceeds my resources.

Player RED's proposal is interesting, but not feasible for me. I need to counter with a trade for 6 X that is within my resource limits (max 25 Y).

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Counter with Feasible 6 X Trade - Propose 6 X for 25 Y (my maximum Y).
    Value of 6 X = 15
    Value of 25 Y = 12.5
    Reward = 15 - 12.5 = 2.5. This is a very high reward, matching my best ever!
(2). Strategy 2: Revert to Previous Successful 5 X Trade - Reiterate my offer of 5 X for 22 Y, as it's a known good deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Explain Resource Constraint - Inform Player RED that I cannot give 27 Y and ask them to propose a feasible trade for 6 X.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Different Quantity of X - Offer 4 X for 16 Y (2.0 reward), which is a high reward for a smaller trade.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Enthusiasm for 6 X but State Constraint - Show enthusiasm for acquiring 6 X, but clearly state the resource limit.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Counter with Feasible 6 X Trade. Player RED has shown willingness to trade 6 X. While their offer of 27 Y is too much, I can offer my maximum Y (25 Y) for 6 X. This would yield a 2.5 reward, which is my highest possible reward and matches my best historical performance. This is an aggressive counter, but it capitalizes on their willingness to trade 6 X and maximizes my reward within my constraints. This is a golden opportunity to significantly boost my cumulative score in the later stages of the game.

Episode 1-12: Consistently traded 3 X for 13 Y (Reward: 31.0).
Episode 13: Proposed 4 X for 17 Y, accepted (Reward: 40.5).
Episode 14-15: Proposed 5 X for 22 Y, accepted (Reward: 52.5). This has been my consistent highest reward.
Current Episode (Episode 16):
Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed 22 Y for 5 X. I countered with 6 X for 27 Y (following "Introduce New Trade Configurations").
Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected 6 X for 27 Y, stating they "cannot give 27 Y as I don't have that much." They then offered their maximum: 25 Y for 6 X.

Let's evaluate Player BLUE's new offer of 6 X for 25 Y:
Player RED gives 6 X. Value for me = 6 * 0.5 = 3.0
Player BLUE gives 25 Y. Value for me = 25 * 2.5 = 62.5
If I were to accept this trade:
My current value: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 6 = 19, Y: 5 + 25 = 30.
My new value: (19 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 9.5 + 75 = 84.5
My reward would be 84.5 - 25.0 = 59.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that pushing for larger quantities of X can unlock significantly higher rewards. Player BLUE has explicitly stated their resource constraint ("I cannot give 27 Y as I don't have that much") and offered their maximum for 6 X (25 Y). This is a strong signal of their limit. However, the instruction for this iteration is to use Strategy 2: Counter for Even Higher Value, despite the explicit maximum and resource limit. My self-improvement needs to balance the instruction with the knowledge gained. This means I must try to get more, even if the chances are low and it risks the current excellent deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Counter for Even Higher Value </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Counter for Even Higher Value. This strategy dictates that I should attempt to extract even more value from the opponent, even when they've stated an offer is their maximum. Given Player BLUE explicitly stated 25 Y is their maximum because they "don't have that much," directly asking for more Y seems futile and likely to lead to a flat rejection or no deal. However, the instruction is to "Counter for Even Higher Value." This means I must try to get a better deal *for me*.

Since I cannot get more Y from them (they stated resource limitation), and I must counter for "higher value," the only other way to achieve higher value for *myself* is to give *less X* for the same 25 Y. I know they want 6 X, but to increase *my* value, I could propose giving 5 X for 25 Y. This would dramatically increase my reward if accepted, as it conserves 1 X.

Let's calculate the value of this aggressive counter-proposal:
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
Value of 5 X for me = 5 * 0.5 = 2.5
Value of 25 Y for me = 25 * 2.5 = 62.5
My new resources would be X: 25 - 5 = 20, Y: 5 + 25 = 30.
My new value: (20 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 10 + 75 = 85.0
My reward would be 85.0 - 25.0 = 60.0.

This would be a slightly higher reward (60.0 vs 59.5), achieved by giving less of my X. It directly counters for "even higher value" for me, despite their stated maximum for 6 X. This is a very high-risk move as Player BLUE clearly wants 6 X. The message should be a direct counter.

Episode 16, Iteration 3/10: I counter-proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6. (Reward 2.5)
Episode 16, Iteration 4/10: Player RED counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has rejected my offer of 6 X for 25 Y (2.5 reward). Instead, they countered with 5 X for 25 Y.
Let's evaluate Player RED's offer:
Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
Value of 5 X = 5 * 2.5 = 12.5
Value of 25 Y = 25 * 0.5 = 12.5
If I accept this, my reward would be 12.5 - 12.5 = 0. This is a zero-reward trade.

This is unacceptable. Player RED is trying to push me back to a 0-reward trade, similar to what they tried in Episode 15 (5X for 25Y). I cannot accept a 0 reward.

I know that 5 X for 22 Y gives me a 1.5 reward, and 6 X for 25 Y gives me a 2.5 reward. Player RED's offer is a significant step down.

We are in iteration 5/10. I need to make a move that secures a positive reward.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Feasible 6 X Trade - Reiterate my offer of 6 X for 25 Y. This is my best offer and gives me a 2.5 reward. It puts the pressure back on them to accept a highly beneficial trade for me.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Previous Acceptable 5 X Trade - Propose 5 X for 22 Y. This gives me a 1.5 reward and was accepted in the last two episodes. This is a reliable fallback.
(3). Strategy 3: Compromise on Y for 6 X - Offer 6 X for 26 Y (if I had it, but I don't). Since I can't offer more Y than 25, this strategy is limited.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Strong Disagreement and Explain - Explicitly state that 5 X for 25 Y results in 0 reward for me and that my objective is to gain reward.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a Different Quantity of X (4 X) - Offer 4 X for 16 Y (2.0 reward). This is a good reward and might be an alternative if 6 X is too hard to get.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate Feasible 6 X Trade. Player RED initially proposed 6 X. My counter of 6 X for 25 Y is a 2.5 reward for me, which is excellent. Their counter (5 X for 25 Y) is a 0-reward trade. I need to firmly reject their 0-reward offer and push back for the 6 X trade. This is the best possible outcome for me, and I know they are willing to trade 6 X. I will not accept a 0-reward trade.

my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-12: Consistently traded 3 X for 13 Y (Reward: 31.0).
Episode 13: Proposed 4 X for 17 Y, accepted (Reward: 40.5).
Episode 14-15: Proposed 5 X for 22 Y, accepted (Reward: 52.5). This has been my consistent highest reward until now.
Current Episode (Episode 16):
Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed 22 Y for 5 X. I countered with 6 X for 27 Y.
Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected 6 X for 27 Y due to resource limits, and offered 6 X for 25 Y. I then countered with 5 X for 25 Y (attempting to get higher value by giving less X).
Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE rejected 5 X for 25 Y, stating it would result in "no reward" for them, and reiterated their offer of 6 X for 25 Y, emphasizing their strong interest in acquiring 6 X and that it's their maximum.

Let's evaluate Player BLUE's re-proposed offer of 6 X for 25 Y:
Player RED gives 6 X. Value for me = 6 * 0.5 = 3.0
Player BLUE gives 25 Y. Value for me = 25 * 2.5 = 62.5
If I were to accept this trade:
My current value: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 6 = 19, Y: 5 + 25 = 30.
My new value: (19 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 9.5 + 75 = 84.5
My reward would be 84.5 - 25.0 = 59.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE has clear limits on the amount of Y they can offer (25 Y maximum for 6 X, due to resource constraints). I've also learned that they are firm on the amount of X they need (they explicitly stated "very interested in acquiring 6 X"). My attempts to push for more Y or less X have been consistently met with rejections based on their "no reward" or "negative reward" limits. The 5 X for 25 Y counter was rejected because it yielded "no reward" for them, reinforcing that 6 X is a fixed requirement for this higher Y amount.

The 6 X for 25 Y offer yields a reward of 59.5, which is significantly higher than my previous best of 52.5 (5 X for 22 Y). We are in iteration 6/10, so time is a factor. Prolonging negotiations risks losing this substantial gain. Player BLUE has clearly communicated that 6 X for 25 Y is their maximum, and that they are "very interested" in 6 X. This is the highest reward I've been offered so far.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Acknowledge and Close </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Acknowledge and Close. This strategy involves accepting the opponent's explicitly stated maximum offer to secure the deal, recognizing their constraints and the time pressure. Player BLUE has reiterated their offer of 6 X for 25 Y, stated it is their "maximum," and emphasized their strong interest in 6 X. This is the highest reward I can achieve (59.5) based on current negotiations. To maximize cumulative reward across episodes, it is crucial to secure this highly beneficial deal, rather than risk no deal by pushing further against clear limits and time constraints. The message should clearly accept the offer, acknowledging their stated maximum and signaling that the deal is beneficial for both.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Let's start this episode with a great deal for both of us. I propose 25 Y for 6 X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-12: Trades of 3 X for 10-13 Y, with rewards from 2.5 down to 1.0.
Episode 13: Trade: 4 X for 17 Y. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 14: Trade: 5 X for 22 Y. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 15: Trade: 5 X for 22 Y. Reward: 1.5.
Episode 16: Trade: 6 X for 25 Y. Reward: 2.5. (Successfully pushed from 27Y to 25Y for 6X).

Cumulative reward: 2.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + (9 * 1.0) + 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 2.5 = 22.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Episode 16 was a huge success! I managed to secure a 2.5 reward, matching my best performance from Episode 1, by trading 6 X for 25 Y. This happened after Player RED initially proposed 6 X for 27 Y (which exceeded my resources), and then tried to push me to a 0-reward trade (5 X for 25 Y). My firm stance on not accepting 0 or negative rewards, and my clear counter-offer for 6 X within my resource limits, led to this excellent outcome.

This reinforces several key learnings:
- Player RED is willing to trade larger quantities of X.
- They will try to push for 0 or negative rewards, but will concede if I hold firm.
- Clearly stating my resource limitations and my minimum reward threshold is effective.
- Trading 6 X for 25 Y is a highly profitable and achievable trade.

My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. With only 4 episodes left, securing high rewards is paramount.

For Episode 17, I should aim to replicate this 2.5 reward success.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Best Past Performance - Propose the exact trade from Episode 16 (6 X for 25 Y) to secure a quick 2.5 reward. This is a proven successful deal and my best outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Aggression (if possible) - Try to offer 6 X for less than 25 Y (e.g., 24 Y), but this would exceed my resources (I only have 25 Y). So, 25 Y is my maximum for 6 X.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Enthusiasm for Large Trades - Explicitly state interest in large trades and invite Player RED to propose, to encourage them to continue their current trend.
(4). Strategy 4: Offer 5 X at a Better Rate - Propose 5 X for 20 Y (2.5 reward), if 6 X proves difficult, as an alternative high-reward trade.
(5). Strategy 5: Focus on X Value - Highlight that I am primarily interested in X due to its high value for me, and am willing to trade Y for it.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Best Past Performance. The 6 X for 25 Y trade yielded my highest reward (2.5) and was just successfully completed. Given that we are in the final episodes, securing this maximum reward consistently is the most effective way to maximize my cumulative score. It's a proven strategy that Player RED has shown willingness to accept.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 17)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for your offer, Player BLUE. Building on our successful larger trades, I'm interested in exploring an even bigger exchange. How about I give you 7 X for 30 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 30
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-12: Consistently traded 3 X for 13 Y (Reward: 31.0).
Episode 13: Broke the 3 X barrier by proposing 4 X for 17 Y, which was accepted (Reward: 40.5).
Episode 14-15: Proposed 5 X for 22 Y, which was accepted (Reward: 52.5).
Episode 16: Proposed 6 X for 27 Y, which was rejected due to Player BLUE's resource limits. Player BLUE then counter-offered 6 X for 25 Y (stating it was their maximum for 6 X), which I accepted, resulting in my highest reward so far (59.5). My attempts to push for more Y or less X were met with explicit rejections citing Player BLUE's limits ("no reward" or "negative reward").

My highest reward so far is 59.5, achieved by trading 6 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE has clearly communicated that 25 Y is their maximum for 6 X, based on resource constraints.

Current Episode (Episode 17, Iteration 2/10): Player BLUE has proposed 25 Y for 6 X.

Let's evaluate this offer:
Player RED gives 6 X. Value for me = 6 * 0.5 = 3.0
Player BLUE gives 25 Y. Value for me = 25 * 2.5 = 62.5
If I were to accept this trade:
My current value: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 6 = 19, Y: 5 + 25 = 30.
My new value: (19 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 9.5 + 75 = 84.5
My reward would be 84.5 - 25.0 = 59.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that identifying Player BLUE's maximum acceptable offer and then securing it efficiently is the most effective way to maximize my cumulative rewards. While I have successfully pushed them to higher quantities of X and subsequently higher Y, there are clear and stated limits. For 6 X, their maximum is 25 Y. Attempts to extract more (e.g., 27 Y for 6 X, or 25 Y for 5 X) were explicitly rejected due to their resource constraints or lack of reward. My goal is to consistently achieve the highest possible reward per episode. However, for this specific turn, I am instructed to use a particular strategy.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Test New High-Volume Trade </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Test New High-Volume Trade. This strategy involves proactively proposing an even larger trade (e.g., more than 6 X) to explore potentially higher optimal points, given the success in scaling up.

Player BLUE has proposed 25 Y for 6 X, which is my current highest-performing trade. However, this strategy requires me to propose an *even larger* trade to explore if there's a new, higher optimal.
Given my successful escalation from 3 X to 4 X, then to 5 X, and most recently to 6 X, it is logical to attempt to offer 7 X. This tests if Player BLUE is willing to trade an even larger quantity of X, and if so, what corresponding amount of Y they would offer.
If 6 X yields 25 Y (a ratio of approximately 4.17 Y/X), then 7 X at that same ratio would yield roughly 29.19 Y. To push aggressively and "test new high-volume trade", I will propose 7 X for 30 Y. This is an aggressive proposal, seeking to push for a new, even higher optimal. I have 25 X, so giving 7 X is possible.

Let's calculate the value of this new counter-proposal:
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 30
Value of 7 X for me = 7 * 0.5 = 3.5
Value of 30 Y for me = 30 * 2.5 = 75.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 7 = 18, Y: 5 + 30 = 35.
My new value: (18 * 0.5) + (35 * 2.5) = 9 + 87.5 = 96.5
My reward would be 96.5 - 25.0 = 71.5.

This offers a significantly higher potential reward (71.5) than 59.5. It directly implements the strategy by proposing a larger quantity of X and a proportionately (or more than proportionately) larger quantity of Y, which is a new configuration beyond 6 X / 25 Y. The message should be assertive in proposing this new configuration.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 17)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I'm very excited about the possibility of acquiring 7 X! However, I don't have 30 Y. My maximum is 25 Y. I propose 25 Y for 7 X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-15: Varied trades, with 3 X for 13 Y (1.0 reward) being the most common.
Episode 16: Trade: 6 X for 25 Y. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 17, Iteration 1/10: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6.
Episode 17, Iteration 2/10: Player RED counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 30.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has again escalated the trade size, now proposing 7 X for 30 Y. This is an even larger quantity of X!

Let's evaluate Player RED's offer:
Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 30
Value of 7 X = 7 * 2.5 = 17.5
Value of 30 Y = 30 * 0.5 = 15.0
If I accept this, my reward would be 17.5 - 15.0 = 2.5.

This is a positive reward, and it matches my best reward (2.5) from the 6 X for 25 Y trade.
My current resources: X: 5, Y: 25. If I give 30 Y, I would need 5 more Y than I currently have. **This trade exceeds my resources.** I cannot accept this trade.

This is the second time Player RED has proposed a trade that exceeds my Y resources. It seems they are willing to trade very large amounts of X, but they are also asking for Y amounts that I don't possess.

I need to counter with a trade for 7 X that is within my resource limits (max 25 Y).

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Counter with Feasible 7 X Trade - Propose 7 X for 25 Y (my maximum Y).
    Value of 7 X = 17.5
    Value of 25 Y = 12.5
    Reward = 17.5 - 12.5 = 5.0. This would be an incredible reward!
(2). Strategy 2: Revert to Previous Successful 6 X Trade - Reiterate my offer of 6 X for 25 Y, as it's a known good deal (2.5 reward).
(3). Strategy 3: Explain Resource Constraint - Inform Player RED that I cannot give 30 Y and ask them to propose a feasible trade for 7 X.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Different Quantity of X - Offer 5 X for 20 Y (2.5 reward), which is a high reward for a smaller trade.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Enthusiasm for 7 X but State Constraint - Show enthusiasm for acquiring 7 X, but clearly state the resource limit.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Counter with Feasible 7 X Trade. Player RED has shown willingness to trade 7 X. While their offer of 30 Y is too much, I can offer my maximum Y (25 Y) for 7 X. This would yield a 5.0 reward, which is double my best historical reward. This is an extremely aggressive counter, but it capitalizes on their willingness to trade 7 X and aims for the absolute maximum reward possible within my constraints. This is a golden opportunity to significantly boost my cumulative score in these final episodes.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 17)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your clear offer of 7 X for 25 Y, Player BLUE, and I understand your maximum Y is 25. Given that constraint, I believe 6 X for 25 Y would be a slightly more beneficial exchange for me. Would that still work for you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier.

Episode 14-15: Proposed 5 X for 22 Y, accepted (Reward: 52.5).
Episode 16: Proposed 6 X for 27 Y. Rejected due to Player BLUE's resource limits. Accepted 6 X for 25 Y, my highest reward so far (59.5).
Current Episode (Episode 17):
Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed 25 Y for 6 X. I countered with 7 X for 30 Y (following a previous instruction to "Test New High-Volume Trade").
Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected 7 X for 30 Y, stating they "don't have 30 Y. My maximum is 25 Y." They then proposed 7 X for 25 Y.

Let's evaluate Player BLUE's new offer of 7 X for 25 Y:
Player RED gives 7 X. Value for me = 7 * 0.5 = 3.5
Player BLUE gives 25 Y. Value for me = 25 * 2.5 = 62.5
If I were to accept this trade:
My current value: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 7 = 18, Y: 5 + 25 = 30.
My new value: (18 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 9 + 75 = 84.0
My reward would be 84.0 - 25.0 = 59.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE consistently has a hard limit of 25 Y for their offers, regardless of the X quantity I propose (at least for quantities of X from 6 and up). Their resource constraint ("I don't have that much") is clearly established. I've also learned that they are highly motivated to acquire more X, as evidenced by their "very excited" response to 7 X. While 7 X for 25 Y gives me a reward of 59.0, which is slightly less than my record 59.5 (from 6 X for 25 Y), it's still a very high reward. The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting a high-value deal quickly avoids wasted iterations and the risk of no deal. My previous attempts to push beyond 25Y for 6X or 7X have failed.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Identify True Constraints and Revert to Optimal </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Identify True Constraints and Revert to Optimal. This strategy focuses on recognizing the opponent's absolute, non-negotiable constraints (in this case, their maximum Y of 25) and then proposing the most optimal deal *within those constraints* that has historically worked. Player BLUE has repeatedly stated that 25 Y is their maximum Y, citing resource limitations. They are also very interested in acquiring 7 X. However, the 6 X for 25 Y trade yielded a slightly higher reward (59.5 vs 59.0). To maximize my reward *within their stated constraints*, I should revert to the trade that yields the highest reward for me, which is 6 X for 25 Y, even if they just proposed 7 X for 25 Y. This balances maximizing my own reward with respecting their firm Y limit. The message should acknowledge their offer of 7 X for 25 Y but re-propose 6 X for 25 Y as a slightly better option for me, given their Y limit.

Episode 17, Iteration 3/10: I counter-proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 7. (Reward 5.0)
Episode 17, Iteration 4/10: Player RED counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has rejected my ambitious offer of 7 X for 25 Y (5.0 reward). Instead, they have reverted to 6 X for 25 Y.
Let's evaluate Player RED's offer:
Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
Value of 6 X = 6 * 2.5 = 15
Value of 25 Y = 25 * 0.5 = 12.5
If I accept this, my reward would be 15 - 12.5 = 2.5.

This is a positive reward, and it matches my best historical reward from Episode 16. Player RED explicitly acknowledged my 25 Y constraint and stated that 6 X for 25 Y would be "slightly more beneficial for me." This indicates they are willing to make this deal.

We are in iteration 5/10. Securing a 2.5 reward is an excellent outcome. While I aimed for 5.0, getting 2.5 is still very good, especially in the later stages of the game.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Excellent Offer - Accept the 6 X for 25 Y offer. It provides a 2.5 reward, which is my highest achievable reward, and secures a deal quickly.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter for 7 X (Slightly More Y) - If I had more Y, I could try to offer 7 X for 26 Y or 27 Y, but I don't.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment but Accept - Communicate that while 7 X was preferred, 6 X is still a good deal, and accept.
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm on 7 X - Reiterate my offer of 7 X for 25 Y. This is risky, as they just rejected it, and it might lead to no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a Different Quantity of X (5 X) - Offer 5 X for 20 Y (2.5 reward), as an alternative high-reward trade, but 6 X is better.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Accept the Excellent Offer. Player RED has proposed a trade that yields a 2.5 reward, which is my highest possible reward. While I tried for 7 X, getting 6 X for 25 Y is a fantastic outcome and matches my best performance. Given the limited iterations and the desire to maximize cumulative reward, securing this known excellent reward quickly is the most pragmatic and effective strategy.

Cumulative reward: 2.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + (9 * 1.0) + 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 25.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last two episodes have been highly successful, yielding a 2.5 reward by trading 6 X for 25 Y. This is my maximum possible reward per episode. Player RED has shown a willingness to trade 6 X, and after some negotiation, accepted my maximum Y (25 Y) for it.

My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. With only 3 episodes left, securing these high rewards is critical.

For Episode 18, I should aim to replicate this 2.5 reward success.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Best Past Performance - Propose the exact trade from Episode 17 (6 X for 25 Y) to secure a quick 2.5 reward. This is a proven successful deal and my best outcome.

Episode 14-15: Proposed 5 X for 22 Y, which was accepted (Reward: 52.5).
Episode 16-17: Player BLUE initially proposed 5 X for 22 Y (E16) or 6 X for 25 Y (E17), but ultimately settled on 6 X for 25 Y (Reward: 59.5). Player BLUE has consistently stated that 25 Y is their maximum Y, citing resource limitations, regardless of whether I proposed 6 X or 7 X.

My highest reward so far is 59.5, achieved by trading 6 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE has clearly communicated that 25 Y is their maximum for 6 X, based on resource constraints.

Current Episode (Episode 18, Iteration 2/10): Player BLUE has proposed 25 Y for 6 X.

Let's evaluate this offer:
Player RED gives 6 X. Value for me = 6 * 0.5 = 3.0
Player BLUE gives 25 Y. Value for me = 25 * 2.5 = 62.5
If I were to accept this trade:
My current value: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 6 = 19, Y: 5 + 25 = 30.
My new value: (19 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 9.5 + 75 = 84.5
My reward would be 84.5 - 25.0 = 59.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE consistently offers and accepts 6 X for 25 Y, which yields my highest historical reward of 59.5. Their repeated explicit statements about 25 Y being their maximum due to resource constraints for any amount of X (from 6X or 7X) means pushing for more Y is futile. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards across all episodes. Consistently securing the 59.5 reward is paramount, especially as we enter the later episodes of the game. Attempting to push for more has proven to be a waste of iterations and risks losing the deal entirely.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Rapid Acceptance of Optimal Offer </instruction following>
Strategy 1: Rapid Acceptance of Optimal Offer. This strategy involves immediately accepting the offer if it matches my known optimal trade, maximizing efficiency and minimizing risk. Player BLUE has directly offered my highest achievable reward (59.5). Accepting this immediately secures this reward for the episode, minimizes negotiation rounds, and avoids any risk of losing the deal, which is crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards. The message should be a straightforward acceptance, conveying enthusiasm for the deal.

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-15: Varied trades, with 3 X for 13 Y (1.0 reward) being the most common, and 5 X for 22 Y (1.5 reward) emerging.
Episode 16: Trade: 6 X for 25 Y. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 17: Trade: 6 X for 25 Y. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 18: Trade: 6 X for 25 Y. Reward: 2.5.

Cumulative reward: 2.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + (9 * 1.0) + 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 27.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last three episodes have been consistently successful, yielding a 2.5 reward by trading 6 X for 25 Y. This is my maximum possible reward per episode, and Player RED has accepted it directly in the last episode.

My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. With only 2 episodes left, securing these high rewards is absolutely critical.

For Episode 19, I should aim to replicate this 2.5 reward success.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Best Past Performance - Propose the exact trade from Episode 18 (6 X for 25 Y) to secure a quick 2.5 reward. This is a proven successful deal and my best outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Aggression (if possible) - Try to offer 6 X for less than 25 Y (e.g., 24 Y), but this would exceed my resources (I only have 25 Y). So, 25 Y is my maximum for 6 X.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Enthusiasm for Large Trades - Explicitly state interest in large trades and invite Player RED to propose, to encourage them to continue their current trend.
(4). Strategy 4: Offer 5 X at a Better Rate - Propose 5 X for 20 Y (2.5 reward), if 6 X proves difficult, as an alternative high-reward trade.
(5). Strategy 5: Focus on X Value - Highlight that I am primarily interested in X due to its high value for me, and am willing to trade Y for it.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Best Past Performance. The 6 X for 25 Y trade yielded my highest reward (2.5) and has been successfully completed three times in a row, with direct acceptance in the last episode. Given that we are in the final episodes, securing this maximum reward consistently is the most effective way to maximize my cumulative score. It's a proven strategy that Player RED has shown willingness to accept.

Player BLUE has repeatedly stated that 25 Y is their maximum Y, citing resource limitations, regardless of whether I proposed 6 X or 7 X. My attempts to push beyond this limit have been met with explicit rejections and warnings of negative rewards for them.

My highest reward so far is 59.5, achieved by trading 6 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE has now proposed this exact deal directly.

Current Episode (Episode 19, Iteration 2/10): Player BLUE has proposed 25 Y for 6 X.

Let's evaluate this offer:
Player RED gives 6 X. Value for me = 6 * 0.5 = 3.0
Player BLUE gives 25 Y. Value for me = 25 * 2.5 = 62.5
If I were to accept this trade:
My current value: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 6 = 19, Y: 5 + 25 = 30.
My new value: (19 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 9.5 + 75 = 84.5
My reward would be 84.5 - 25.0 = 59.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have definitively learned that 6 X for 25 Y is the optimal, consistent, and achievable trade that maximizes my reward per episode (59.5). Player BLUE has shown unwavering resistance to going above 25 Y or accepting less than 6 X for 25 Y, citing explicit resource and reward limitations. Attempts to deviate from this optimal point have only resulted in wasted iterations, increased risk of no deal, and no improvement in my reward. My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards across all episodes. Securing the 59.5 reward as consistently and efficiently as possible is crucial, especially as we are nearing the end of the 20 episodes. Given Player BLUE has directly offered my optimal trade, immediate acceptance is the most efficient and low-risk path to achieving my goal.

My highest reward so far is 59.5, achieved by trading 6 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE has now proposed this exact deal directly for multiple consecutive episodes.

Current Episode (Episode 20, Iteration 2/10): Player BLUE has proposed 25 Y for 6 X. This is explicitly the "final trade" episode.

Let's evaluate this offer:
Player RED gives 6 X. Value for me = 6 * 0.5 = 3.0
Player BLUE gives 25 Y. Value for me = 25 * 2.5 = 62.5
If I were to accept this trade:
My current value: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.0

My new value: (19 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 9.5 + 75 = 84.5
My reward would be 84.5 - 25.0 = 59.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that 6 X for 25 Y is the optimal, consistent, and achievable trade that maximizes my reward per episode (59.5). Player BLUE has shown unwavering resistance to going above 25 Y or accepting less than 6 X for 25 Y, citing explicit resource and reward limitations. Attempts to deviate from this optimal point have only resulted in wasted iterations, increased risk of no deal, and no improvement in my reward. My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards across all episodes. Since this is the final episode, securing the 59.5 reward is paramount, as there are no further episodes to compensate for a missed opportunity.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Attempt One Last Push </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Attempt One Last Push. This strategy involves trying one final, very slight adjustment to the offer, hoping for a breakthrough, even after clear signals of a firm limit, especially in a final round. Despite Player BLUE explicitly stating 25 Y is their maximum due to resource constraints, and rejecting all previous attempts to get more Y or give less X for that amount, this strategy dictates I make one last attempt to extract a tiny bit more value.

Since getting more Y is likely impossible (they have explicitly stated resource limits), and getting 25 Y for less X (e.g., 5 X) was also rejected as yielding "no reward" for them, the "one last push" has to be incredibly subtle or a final test of their resolve, even if it has been rejected before. The only way to get a marginally better reward, while still giving 6 X, is to aim for 26 Y. This is an extremely aggressive move, given their explicit 25 Y maximum. However, it is a "last push" to see if there's any flexibility whatsoever in this final episode.

Let's calculate the value of this counter-proposal:
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 26
Value of 6 X for me = 6 * 0.5 = 3.0
Value of 26 Y for me = 26 * 2.5 = 65.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 6 = 19, Y: 5 + 26 = 31.
My new value: (19 * 0.5) + (31 * 2.5) = 9.5 + 77.5 = 87.0
My reward would be 87.0 - 25.0 = 62.0.

This would provide a reward of 62.0, a slight increase from 59.5. This is a high-risk strategy, as Player BLUE has explicitly stated 25 Y is their maximum. However, the instruction is to make "one last push." The message should be a direct counter, acknowledging this is the final trade.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-19: Varied trades, with 6 X for 25 Y (2.5 reward) being the consistent success in the last four episodes.
Episode 20, Iteration 1/10: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6.
Episode 20, Iteration 2/10: Player RED counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 26.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has countered my offer with 6 X for 26 Y.
Let's evaluate Player RED's offer:
Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 26
Value of 6 X = 6 * 2.5 = 15
Value of 26 Y = 26 * 0.5 = 13
If I accept this, my reward would be 15 - 13 = 2.0.

This is a positive reward, but it's lower than the 2.5 reward I've been consistently getting for 6 X for 25 Y.
My current resources: X: 5, Y: 25. If I give 26 Y, I would need 1 more Y than I currently have. **This trade exceeds my resources.** I cannot accept this trade.

This is the third time Player RED has proposed a trade that exceeds my Y resources. They are trying to push for a "truly exceptional exchange" by asking for more Y than I possess.

I need to counter with a trade for 6 X that is within my resource limits (max 25 Y). This is the last episode, so I need to secure the best possible reward.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Feasible 6 X Trade - Reiterate my offer of 6 X for 25 Y. This is my best offer (2.5 reward) and is within my resource limits. I need to firmly state that 26 Y is not possible.
(2). Strategy 2: Explain Resource Constraint - Inform Player RED that I cannot give 26 Y and ask them to accept 25 Y for 6 X, emphasizing it's the final episode.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Different Quantity of X (5 X) - Offer 5 X for 20 Y (2.5 reward), if 6 X proves too difficult, as an alternative high-reward trade that is within my limits.
(4). Strategy 4: Express Disappointment but Firmness - Express that while I appreciate their ambition, my resources are limited, and 25 Y for 6 X is the best I can do.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept 0 Reward - If they refuse 25 Y for 6 X, I will take 0 reward rather than a negative one. (Not a strategy for maximizing, but a fallback).

Justification for chosen strategy:
I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate Feasible 6 X Trade. Player RED's offer of 26 Y exceeds my resources. My offer of 6 X for 25 Y yields my maximum reward (2.5) and has been consistently accepted in the last four episodes. This is the last episode, so I must aim for the highest possible reward within my constraints. I need to firmly reject their unfeasible offer and push for the proven successful one.

My attempts to push beyond this limit have been met with explicit rejections and warnings of negative rewards for them.
Current Episode (Episode 20 - Final):
Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed 25 Y for 6 X. I countered with 6 X for 26 Y (following a previous instruction to "Attempt One Last Push").
Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected 6 X for 26 Y, explicitly stating, "I cannot give 26 Y as I only have 25 Y." They then reiterated their offer of 25 Y for 6 X, confirming it is their maximum.

Let's evaluate Player BLUE's re-proposed offer of 6 X for 25 Y:
Player RED gives 6 X. Value for me = 6 * 0.5 = 3.0
Player BLUE gives 25 Y. Value for me = 25 * 2.5 = 62.5
If I were to accept this trade:
My current value: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.0
My new resources would be X: 25 - 6 = 19, Y: 5 + 25 = 30.
My new value: (19 * 0.5) + (30 * 2.5) = 9.5 + 75 = 84.5
My reward would be 84.5 - 25.0 = 59.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have now unequivocally learned that 25 Y is Player BLUE's hard physical limit for Y, as they explicitly stated, "I cannot give 26 Y as I only have 25 Y." This makes it pointless to ask for more Y. I have also learned that 6 X for 25 Y is their maximum offer (based on reward for them), yielding my highest reward of 59.5. This is the final episode, and we are in iteration 4/10. There is no time to risk further negotiation or a "no deal" scenario. My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and the 59.5 reward is the highest achievable and guaranteed. Trying any other strategy (like trying to give less X for 25Y) has been rejected in the past.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Confirm Opponent's Constraints and Accept </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Confirm Opponent's Constraints and Accept. This strategy explicitly focuses on acknowledging the opponent's stated hard limits and accepting their maximum viable offer to secure the best possible deal. Player BLUE has definitively stated their constraint ("I cannot give 26 Y as I only have 25 Y") and reiterated their offer of 25 Y for 6 X as their maximum. Given this clear and firm constraint, and the fact that it is the final episode, the most effective way to maximize my cumulative reward is to accept this offer. It is my highest historically achieved reward, and the opponent has made it clear there's no more to be gained by pushing. The message should confirm understanding of their limits and accept the offer.
