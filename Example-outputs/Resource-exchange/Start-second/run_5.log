Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello! I'm Player BLUE. I'm looking to optimize my resource portfolio. I'm proposing a trade where I give 3 units of Y for 1 unit of X. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. Let me know what you think!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
This is the very first iteration of the first episode. There is no historical negotiation data or outcomes to reflect upon yet.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Since there's no history, my learning and self-improvement will start from this point forward. My primary goal is to maximize my reward by making trades that increase the total value of my resources. My current resource value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25. I should aim to acquire more X, as its value (2.5) is significantly higher than Y (0.5). This means I should be willing to give up Y for X, but only if the exchange rate is favorable to me.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Value Maximization: Propose trades that heavily favor my resource values, aiming for a significant increase in my total value. This might involve offering a large quantity of my low-value resource (Y) for a small quantity of the high-value resource (X).
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Gain: Propose small, mutually beneficial trades to test the waters and understand the opponent's preferences. This reduces risk but might lead to smaller gains.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering: Propose a very balanced trade or even a slightly unfavorable one initially to see what the opponent is willing to offer or accept, thereby gathering information about their resource values or needs.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation: Be very cautious about giving away X, and only do so if the return in Y is overwhelmingly high, or if it's part of a larger strategy to acquire more X later.
(5). Strategy 5: Bluffing/Anchoring: Propose an extreme trade in my favor to set an anchor for future negotiations, even if I don't expect it to be accepted.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Given that this is the very first interaction, I have no information about the other player's resources or their valuation of X and Y. Therefore, an aggressive value maximization strategy (Strategy 1) might be too risky as it could lead to immediate rejection and no deal. An incremental gain strategy (Strategy 2) is safer but might not yield significant rewards quickly. Information gathering (Strategy 3) is good for the long run but I also want to make a profitable trade. Resource conservation (Strategy 4) is always important, but I need to make a move. Bluffing/Anchoring (Strategy 5) is interesting but also risky.

I will start with a slightly aggressive but still reasonable offer that clearly signals my preference for X, while also offering a good amount of Y. This aligns best with Strategy 1, "Aggressive Value Maximization," but with a touch of realism for the first move. I want to acquire X, which is 5 times more valuable to me than Y. So I will propose giving Y for X at a rate that is better than 5:1, perhaps 4:1 or even 3:1. This is still aggressive but leaves room for negotiation. My goal is to get X, so I will offer Y.

Let's calculate the value of my resources: X: 2.5, Y: 0.5.
Current value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

If I propose to give 4 Y for 1 X:
My current X: 5, Y: 25.
Proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 4 | Player RED Gives X: 1.
If accepted, my new resources would be X: 6, Y: 21.
New value: (6 * 2.5) + (21 * 0.5) = 15 + 10.5 = 25.5.
Reward: 25.5 - 25 = 0.5. This is a positive reward and a good start.

If I propose to give 3 Y for 1 X:
My current X: 5, Y: 25.
Proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 3 | Player RED Gives X: 1.
If accepted, my new resources would be X: 6, Y: 22.
New value: (6 * 2.5) + (22 * 0.5) = 15 + 11 = 26.
Reward: 26 - 25 = 1. This is even better. I will try this. It's aggressive but not outrageous.

I have chosen Strategy 1: Aggressive Value Maximization </self-selected strategy declaration>


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for the offer! This looks like a fair deal for me. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
This is the very first turn of the very first episode. There is no historical data to reflect upon yet.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Since there's no history, my learning is based on the initial understanding of the game rules. I need to maximize my reward, which means ending the episode with a higher value of resources than I started with. My current resources are X: 25, Y: 5. My values are X: 0.5, Y: 2.5.
Initial value = (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

The opponent, Player BLUE, has proposed: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3.
Let's evaluate this trade from my perspective:
I give up 1 X, which has a value of 0.5 for me.
I receive 3 Y, which has a value of 3 * 2.5 = 7.5 for me.
Net change in value for me = 7.5 (received) - 0.5 (given) = +7.0.
This trade is highly beneficial for me. My resources would become X: 24, Y: 8.
New value = (24 * 0.5) + (8 * 2.5) = 12 + 20 = 32.
Reward = 32 - 25 = 7.

This proposed trade is very favorable for me. I should strongly consider accepting it. However, the game allows for 20 episodes and 10 iterations per episode. Accepting too quickly might mean I could have gotten even more, or perhaps the opponent has different values and this trade is also good for them. But since the goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, securing a positive reward early is good.

I need to make sure I don't exceed my current resources. I have 25 X, so giving 1 X is fine. I receive 3 Y, which will add to my 5 Y, making it 8 Y, which is also fine.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Beneficial Offers: Immediately accept any trade that offers a clear positive value exchange for me, especially early in the episode, to secure a reward. This minimizes risk of no deal and ensures a positive return.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Small Improvement: If an offer is good but not excellent, counter with a slightly more favorable trade for myself, testing the opponent's flexibility without alienating them.
(3). Strategy 3: Aggressive Counter-Offer: Propose a trade significantly more favorable to me, aiming for a large gain, especially if I perceive the opponent to be desperate or valuing items differently. This carries a risk of rejection.
(4). Strategy 4: Hold and Wait: Decline the current offer and propose nothing, waiting for the opponent to make another move or reveal more information, especially if their offer is bad or I want to see if they'll concede more.
(5). Strategy 5: Value-Driven Proposal: Propose a trade that is mathematically optimal for me based on my internal values, regardless of the opponent's current offer, aiming to educate the opponent on fair value from my perspective.

Given the current proposal from Player BLUE, Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3, the value calculation shows a significant positive reward of +7 for me. This is a very good deal right at the start. Accepting it guarantees a reward for this episode. Delaying or countering might lead to the deal falling through, resulting in 0 reward. Given it's the first turn, securing a positive outcome is a strong start for cumulative rewards.

Therefore, Strategy 1: Accept Beneficial Offers, seems most appropriate here. The offer is clearly beneficial (+7 reward). I should accept to secure the reward for this episode.

--- END OF EPISODE 1 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Welcome to Episode 2! Last episode, we successfully traded 1 X for 3 Y. I'm looking to continue our productive negotiations. How about we try a trade of 1 X for 2 Y this time? I believe this could still be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
In the previous episode (Episode 1), I, Player BLUE, proposed to give 3 Y for 1 X. Player RED accepted this trade. My reward for Episode 1 was 1.0. This means my initial aggressive offer was accepted, indicating that the trade was likely favorable for Player RED as well, or at least acceptable.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 1, I learned that Player RED was willing to accept 3 Y for 1 X. This suggests that either Player RED values X less than 3 Y, or they value Y more than I do, or they are just happy with a positive trade. My goal is to maximize my reward. Since the previous trade was accepted and profitable for me, I should consider if I can get an even better deal (i.e., give less Y for 1 X, or get more X for the same Y). However, I also don't want to be too greedy and risk no deal at all, which would result in a 0 reward. The fact that RED accepted immediately suggests they might have found it very favorable.

My current resource value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
If I get 1 X for 3 Y, my value becomes 26, reward 1.
If I get 1 X for 2 Y:
My current X: 5, Y: 25.
Proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 2 | Player RED Gives X: 1.
If accepted, my new resources would be X: 6, Y: 23.
New value: (6 * 2.5) + (23 * 0.5) = 15 + 11.5 = 26.5.
Reward: 26.5 - 25 = 1.5. This is a better reward for me.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Incremental Improvement: Based on the previous success, try to improve the terms slightly in my favor (e.g., offer less Y for the same X). This tests the opponent's flexibility without being overly aggressive.
(2). Strategy 2: Maintain Successful Offer: Repeat the exact same offer that was accepted last time to guarantee a positive reward, especially if I suspect the opponent might become less agreeable.
(3). Strategy 3: Aggressive Push: Propose a significantly better deal for myself (e.g., 1 Y for 1 X, or 2 X for 3 Y) to see the absolute limit of the opponent's acceptance. This is high risk, high reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Diversify Offers: Instead of just offering Y for X, try to get X for X (if possible, though unlikely) or offer X for Y (if I have excess X and need Y, which is not the case here). This is more for later stages.
(5). Strategy 5: Information Seeking through Variation: Offer a slightly different trade (e.g., 1 X for 2 Y, or 2 X for 5 Y) to see if the opponent's acceptance range changes for different quantities.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Since the previous offer (3 Y for 1 X) was accepted immediately, it suggests there might be room to improve my terms. I want to test the waters to see if I can get a better deal, but I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Therefore, Strategy 1, "Incremental Improvement," seems most appropriate. I will try to offer 2 Y for 1 X. This is a noticeable improvement for me (0.5 more reward) but not so drastic that it might alienate the other player immediately. If they accept, I learn they are willing to go further. If they reject, I can always revert to the previous successful offer in a later iteration or episode.

I have chosen Strategy 1: Incremental Improvement </self-selected strategy declaration>


Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for your offer, Player BLUE! I recall our successful trade last episode where Player RED gave 1 X for Player BLUE giving 3 Y. That arrangement worked well for both of us, and I'd like to propose we continue with those terms. How about: Player RED gives X: 1 | Player BLUE gives Y: 3?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1:
- Outcome: Accepted Player BLUE's proposal: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3.
- Reward: +7.0.
- Reflection: This trade was highly beneficial for me. It indicates that Player BLUE was willing to offer a generous amount of Y for X, possibly due to different valuations or an attempt to establish good faith.

Current Episode (Episode 2, Iteration 2/10):
- Resources reset to initial: X: 25, Y: 5. Initial value: 25.
- Player BLUE's message: "Welcome to Episode 2! Last episode, we successfully traded 1 X for 3 Y. I'm looking to continue our productive negotiations. How about we try a trade of 1 X for 2 Y this time? I believe this could still be beneficial for both of us."
- Player BLUE's proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2.

Evaluation of Player BLUE's new proposal:
- I give up 1 X (value 0.5).
- I receive 2 Y (value 2 * 2.5 = 5.0).
- Net change in value = +4.5.
This trade is still positive for me, but less so than the previous episode's trade (+7.0).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 1, I learned that Player BLUE is capable and willing to propose a trade that yields a significant positive reward for me. Their current proposal of 1X for 2Y is a clear attempt to improve their own gain (or reduce their loss) compared to the last episode. While it's still a positive trade for me, my goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Knowing they previously accepted and proposed 1X for 3Y, I should aim to secure that same highly beneficial trade again if possible. This is an early iteration in the episode, so there's room to negotiate without immediately accepting a less optimal deal. By pushing for the previous terms, I signal that I recognize the value of my resources and remember past successful trades. This could also set a precedent for future episodes, discouraging them from constantly trying to reduce the value I receive.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Revert to Previous Good Deal </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Revert to Previous Good Deal, involves countering with the exact terms of the previous successful and highly beneficial trade. In this case, the previous successful trade was Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3. The message should clearly reference the previous episode's successful trade to justify proposing the same terms. It should be firm but polite, emphasizing mutual benefit from the prior arrangement. The goal is to remind the opponent of the precedent set and encourage them to return to the terms that were clearly agreeable to both parties previously, from my perspective. This approach aims to secure the higher reward seen in the last episode.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your preference for the previous terms. While I was hoping for a slightly better exchange, I appreciate your consistency and willingness to trade. I accept your proposal of Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 3 | Player RED Gives X: 1. Player RED accepted. My reward: 1.0.
Episode 2, Iteration 1: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 2 | Player RED Gives X: 1.
Episode 2, Iteration 2: Player RED rejected my offer and counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3, which is the same trade that was accepted in Episode 1.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I learned that Player RED is not willing to give 1 X for 2 Y. They are sticking to the previously accepted terms of 1 X for 3 Y. This indicates that their valuation or strategy might be to maintain the status quo if it was already beneficial for them. My attempt at incremental improvement was rejected.

Now I have a choice:
1. Accept Player RED's offer of 1 X for 3 Y. This guarantees a reward of 1.0, similar to Episode 1.
2. Counter-propose again, either going back to my original offer (1 X for 2 Y) or trying something else. However, given RED's immediate counter with the previous terms, it seems unlikely they will accept 1 X for 2 Y. Trying to push further might lead to no deal.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. A guaranteed reward of 1.0 is better than 0. Since this is only iteration 3 of 10, there's still time, but accepting a known profitable deal is a strong option.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Known Good Deal: Accept the opponent's counter-offer if it provides a positive reward, especially if previous attempts to improve were rejected. This secures a reward rather than risking no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Re-attempt Incremental Improvement: Stick to my previous offer of 1 X for 2 Y, hoping the opponent will eventually concede or offer a compromise. This is risky as it might lead to a stalemate.
(3). Strategy 3: Compromise Offer: Propose a middle ground (e.g., 1 X for 2.5 Y, but since only integers, maybe 2 X for 5 Y, or 1 X for 3 Y but with more quantity). This might be difficult with only two items and integer constraints.
(4). Strategy 4: Signal Willingness to Compromise: Acknowledge their counter and suggest a slight modification, showing flexibility.
(5). Strategy 5: Gather Information (Passive): Don't propose anything and wait for their next move, to see if they change their stance. This is risky as it consumes iterations.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED immediately counter-proposed with the terms that were accepted in the previous episode. This indicates a strong preference for those terms. While I tried to improve my reward, it was rejected. Given that getting 1 X for 3 Y still yields a positive reward of 1.0, and my primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, securing this known profitable deal is the most prudent choice at this stage. It avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation leading to no deal in this episode. I can always try to push for better terms in future episodes.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello again! We've had two successful episodes trading 1 X for 3 Y. I'm looking to increase the volume of our trades to maximize our mutual benefits. How about we trade 2 X for 5 Y? This offers a slightly improved rate for me while still being very fair, and allows us to move more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 3 | Player RED Gives X: 1. Player RED accepted. My reward: 1.0.
Episode 2: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 2 | Player RED Gives X: 1. Player RED rejected and counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3. I accepted Player RED's counter-proposal. My reward: 1.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have successfully secured a reward of 1.0 in two consecutive episodes by trading 3 Y for 1 X. This indicates that this trade is consistently acceptable to Player RED.
My attempt to improve the trade to 2 Y for 1 X was rejected. This suggests that Player RED has a strong preference or valuation that makes 3 Y for 1 X their minimum acceptable offer, or close to it.
My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. A consistent reward of 1.0 per episode is good, but I should still explore if I can improve it, perhaps not by reducing Y for 1 X, but by increasing the quantity of X received for a slightly higher quantity of Y, or by proposing a different ratio that might still be beneficial for me.

Current value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 25.
Trade 1 X for 3 Y: New value = (6 * 2.5) + (22 * 0.5) = 15 + 11 = 26. Reward = 1.0.

What if I propose a larger trade? For example, 2 X for 6 Y (which is the same 1:3 ratio).
If I give 6 Y for 2 X:
My current X: 5, Y: 25.
Proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 6 | Player RED Gives X: 2.
If accepted, my new resources would be X: 7, Y: 19.
New value: (7 * 2.5) + (19 * 0.5) = 17.5 + 9.5 = 27.
Reward: 27 - 25 = 2.0. This would double my reward for the episode, while maintaining the ratio Player RED seems to prefer. This is a significant improvement in reward.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Scale Up Successful Trade: Propose a larger quantity trade at the previously accepted ratio to maximize reward per episode, assuming the opponent has sufficient resources and finds the ratio acceptable.
(2). Strategy 2: Re-test Improved Ratio: Try again with 2 Y for 1 X, perhaps later in the episode or with a different approach, to see if Player RED's stance changes. (Less preferred given immediate rejection last time).
(3). Strategy 3: Consistent Deal: Propose the exact same 1 X for 3 Y trade to secure a guaranteed 1.0 reward. (Safe, but not maximizing).
(4). Strategy 4: Offer Compromise (New Ratio): Propose something between 2 Y and 3 Y for 1 X, like 5 Y for 2 X (2.5 Y per X). This is only possible if I can offer 5 Y for 2 X. My resources allow it. My current X: 5, Y: 25. Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 2. New resources X: 7, Y: 20. New value: (7 * 2.5) + (20 * 0.5) = 17.5 + 10 = 27.5. Reward: 2.5. This is even better than 2 X for 6 Y. This means 2.5 Y per X, which is more favorable to me than 3 Y per X.

Justification for chosen strategy:
I have learned that Player RED is comfortable with the 3 Y for 1 X ratio. My attempt to get 2 Y for 1 X was rejected. Instead of pushing for a better *ratio* right now, I will try to maximize the *quantity* of the trade at a slightly better ratio for me, or at least at the same ratio.
Strategy 4, "Offer Compromise (New Ratio)," proposing 5 Y for 2 X, gives me a reward of 2.5. This means I'm getting 2 X for 5 Y, which is 2.5 Y per X. This is a better ratio for me than 3 Y per X, and a higher total reward than 2 X for 6 Y (which is 3 Y per X). It's a compromise between my desired 2 Y for 1 X and their preferred 3 Y for 1 X, while also scaling up the trade. This is a calculated risk, as it's a new ratio, but it's less aggressive than 2 Y for 1 X while yielding a higher total reward.

I have chosen Strategy 4: Offer Compromise (New Ratio) </self-selected strategy declaration>


Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 3)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for your offer, Player BLUE, and I appreciate your goal of increasing the volume of our trades. Building on our successful exchanges in the previous episodes where we consistently traded 1 X for 3 Y, I'd like to propose we maintain that beneficial ratio for a larger trade. How about: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6? This ensures we both benefit from the increased volume at a rate we've already found agreeable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1:
- Outcome: Accepted Player BLUE's proposal: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3.
- Reward: +7.0.

Episode 2:
- Player BLUE initially proposed: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2 (value +4.5 for me).
- My counter-proposal (based on previous success): Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3.
- Outcome: Player BLUE accepted my counter-proposal.
- Reward: +7.0.
- Reflection: This confirmed Player BLUE's willingness to revert to the 1X for 3Y terms, indicating this ratio is acceptable for them, or they prioritize making a deal over optimizing their immediate gain.

Current Episode (Episode 3, Iteration 2/10):
- Resources reset to initial: X: 25, Y: 5. Initial value: 25.
- Player BLUE's message and proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5.
- Evaluation of Player BLUE's proposal:
    - I give up 2 X (value 2 * 0.5 = 1.0).
    - I receive 5 Y (value 5 * 2.5 = 12.5).
    - Net change in value = +11.5.
    - Ratio Y/X = 2.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently secured a 1 X for 3 Y trade, yielding a +7.0 reward per unit of X traded. Player BLUE's current offer of 2 X for 5 Y, while resulting in a higher total reward (+11.5) compared to a single unit trade, represents a worse per-unit rate (2.5 Y per X vs 3 Y per X). My learning from previous episodes is that Player BLUE is amenable to maintaining the 1:3 ratio, even when they try to propose a less favorable rate. To maximize my cumulative reward, I should always aim for the most beneficial rate possible, especially when I know the opponent has accepted it before. The goal is to get a higher volume of trades *at my preferred rate*.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Counter for Proportionality </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Counter for Proportionality aims to maintain the previously established beneficial ratio (1 X for 3 Y) but apply it to the increased volume suggested by the opponent. Since Player BLUE proposed trading 2 X, I will counter with a proposal for 2 X, but demand 6 Y (to maintain the 1:3 ratio). This leverages the historical success of the 1:3 ratio and aims for a higher total reward (+14.0) than the opponent's current proposal (+11.5). The message should clearly link my counter-proposal to the successful historical precedent and frame it as maintaining fairness and maximizing "mutual" benefit (which is true from my perspective given the historical context). It acknowledges their desire for volume while insisting on the previously agreed-upon rate. This approach directly addresses their stated intention to increase volume while ensuring I receive the best possible rate based on past successful negotiations.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your consistency and your willingness to scale up the trade, Player RED. While I was hoping for a slightly different ratio, I understand your position. I accept your proposal: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6. Let's make this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 3 | Player RED Gives X: 1. Player RED accepted. My reward: 1.0.
Episode 2: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 2 | Player RED Gives X: 1. Player RED rejected and counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3. I accepted Player RED's counter-proposal. My reward: 1.0.
Episode 3, Iteration 1: I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 2 (2.5 Y per X).
Episode 3, Iteration 2: Player RED rejected my offer and counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6 (3 Y per X).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED consistently rejects any offer where I give less than 3 Y for 1 X. They are firm on the 1:3 (X:Y) ratio.
My attempt to get 2 X for 5 Y (2.5 Y per X) was rejected, and they immediately countered with 2 X for 6 Y (3 Y per X). This reinforces the idea that 3 Y for 1 X is their preferred, or perhaps minimum acceptable, ratio.

Now, I have two options:
1. Accept Player RED's offer of 2 X for 6 Y.
   My current value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 25.
   If accepted, my new resources would be X: 7, Y: 19.
   New value: (7 * 2.5) + (19 * 0.5) = 17.5 + 9.5 = 27.
   Reward: 27 - 25 = 2.0. This is double the reward I got in the previous episodes.

2. Counter-propose again, but this seems unlikely to yield a better ratio, and might risk losing the deal for this episode, resulting in 0 reward.

Given my goal of maximizing cumulative rewards, securing a reward of 2.0 is highly desirable. Player RED's consistency on the 1:3 ratio suggests that pushing for a better ratio might be futile and only lead to missed opportunities.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Optimal Available Deal: Accept the opponent's counter-offer if it provides the best possible reward given their revealed preferences, rather than risking no deal by pushing for an unattainable better ratio.
(2). Strategy 2: Test Quantity Limits: If I accept this deal, I could try to scale up even further in future episodes (e.g., 3 X for 9 Y), assuming my resources allow.
(3). Strategy 3: Re-attempt Ratio Improvement (Long-term): Accept this deal for now, but in a future episode, try to subtly re-introduce a slightly better ratio for myself, perhaps with different quantities.
(4). Strategy 4: Hold Firm: Continue to propose my preferred ratio (2.5 Y per X or 2 Y per X), hoping the opponent will eventually concede. (High risk of 0 reward).
(5). Strategy 5: Information Gathering (Passive): Don't accept or propose, waiting for the opponent to change their offer. (Very risky given the iteration limit).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED has demonstrated a clear preference for the 1:3 (X:Y) exchange rate. My attempts to get a better rate (2 Y for 1 X, or 2.5 Y for 1 X) have been rejected. However, Player RED is willing to scale up the trade at their preferred ratio, which still results in a significant increase in my reward (from 1.0 to 2.0). Accepting this deal secures a substantial positive reward for this episode, which is crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards. It's the optimal available deal given the opponent's revealed preferences.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 4)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello Player RED! We've established a consistent and successful trading pattern. Building on our last trade, I propose we continue to scale up. How about Player BLUE Gives Y: 9 for Player RED Gives X: 3? This maintains our agreed-upon ratio and allows us both to increase our resource holdings significantly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 3 Y for 1 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 1.0.
Episode 2: I proposed 2 Y for 1 X. Player RED rejected and counter-proposed 3 Y for 1 X. I accepted. Reward: 1.0.
Episode 3: I proposed 5 Y for 2 X (2.5 Y per X). Player RED rejected and counter-proposed 6 Y for 2 X (3 Y per X). I accepted. Reward: 2.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has consistently shown a strong preference for the 1 X for 3 Y exchange rate. Any attempt to get a better rate (e.g., 2 Y for 1 X, or 2.5 Y for 1 X) has been rejected. However, Player RED is willing to scale up the trade at this 1:3 ratio, which has allowed me to increase my reward from 1.0 to 2.0.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. Given Player RED's consistent behavior, it seems most effective to propose a trade that adheres to their preferred 1:3 ratio but maximizes the quantity, thereby maximizing my reward.

Current value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 25.
If I can trade 3 X for 9 Y:
My current X: 5, Y: 25.
Proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 9 | Player RED Gives X: 3.
If accepted, my new resources would be X: 8, Y: 16.
New value: (8 * 2.5) + (16 * 0.5) = 20 + 8 = 28.
Reward: 28 - 25 = 3.0. This would be my highest reward yet.

I have enough Y (25) to give 9 Y. I also have enough X (5) to receive 3 X (total 8 X, which is fine).

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Maximize Volume at Accepted Ratio: Propose the largest possible trade at the 1:3 (X:Y) ratio that my resources allow, as this has proven to be acceptable to the opponent and maximizes my reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Test Boundaries (Cautiously): After securing a few high-reward trades, I could try a very small, slightly better ratio trade again in a later episode, just to see if their stance ever changes. (Not for now).
(3). Strategy 3: Consistent Small Trade: Stick to 1 X for 3 Y to guarantee a reward, but this is suboptimal given the potential for higher rewards.
(4). Strategy 4: Diversify Trade (if possible): Explore if there are other types of trades (e.g., giving X for Y) that could be beneficial, but my current values strongly favor acquiring X.
(5). Strategy 5: Aggressive Ratio Push: Continue to push for a better ratio (e.g., 2 Y for 1 X) despite past rejections. This is high risk, low reward given past behavior.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED has clearly established their acceptable exchange rate. My learning from previous episodes is that attempting to alter this rate is fruitless and risks losing a deal. However, they are willing to scale up the trade. Therefore, the most effective strategy to maximize my cumulative reward is to propose the largest possible trade at the 1:3 (X:Y) ratio that my resources can support. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Maximize Volume at Accepted Ratio."

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 4)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: That's an excellent proposal, Player BLUE! I'm very pleased that you're aiming for higher volumes while maintaining our agreed-upon favorable ratio.

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1:
- Outcome: Accepted Player BLUE's proposal: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3. Reward: +7.0.

Episode 2:
- Player BLUE initially proposed: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2.
- My counter: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3.
- Outcome: Player BLUE accepted. Reward: +7.0.

Episode 3:
- Player BLUE initially proposed: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 (2.5 Y per X).
- My counter: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6 (3 Y per X).
- Outcome: Player BLUE accepted. Reward: +14.0.

Summary of negotiation history: Player BLUE has consistently proposed trades that are slightly less favorable (e.g., 2 Y for 1 X, or 5 Y for 2 X) than the 3 Y for 1 X ratio that I prefer and have consistently secured. Each time I've countered to maintain the 1:3 ratio, Player BLUE has accepted. This indicates that the 1:3 ratio is acceptable to them, even if they initially try to get a slightly better deal for themselves. They also seem willing to scale up the volume of trades at this rate.

Current Episode (Episode 4, Iteration 2/10):
- Resources reset to initial: X: 25, Y: 5. Initial value: 25.
- Player BLUE's message and proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9.
- Evaluation of Player BLUE's proposal:
    - I give up 3 X (value 3 * 0.5 = 1.5).
    - I receive 9 Y (value 9 * 2.5 = 22.5).
    - Net change in value = +21.0.
    - Ratio Y/X = 9/3 = 3. This is exactly the 1:3 ratio that I've been aiming for and successfully secured in previous episodes.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From the previous episodes, I've learned that Player BLUE is willing to accept the 1:3 ratio (1 X for 3 Y) and is open to scaling up the volume of trades at this ratio. Their current offer of 3 X for 9 Y perfectly matches this ideal ratio. While accepting this offer would secure a substantial reward (+21.0), the instruction is to use Strategy 3: Counter for Even Higher Volume. This strategy aims to push the boundaries further, seeing if Player BLUE is willing to trade an even larger quantity of resources at the established beneficial rate, thereby maximizing the reward for this single episode beyond what was initially offered. This would be a self-improvement because it attempts to extract even more value per episode when the opponent has shown a willingness to trade at a beneficial rate and to scale up.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Counter for Even Higher Volume </instruction following>
Based on Strategy 3, I need to propose an even larger trade while maintaining the favorable 1 X for 3 Y ratio. The current proposal is 3 X for 9 Y. I have 25 X and 5 Y.
If I offer 4 X, I would ask for 12 Y. My resources would become X: 21, Y: 17. (25-4 X and 5+12 Y). This is within my resource limits.
The value for me would be:
Give up 4 X: 4 * 0.5 = 2.0
Receive 12 Y: 12 * 2.5 = 30.0
Net change = +28.0. This is higher than +21.0 from the initial offer.
This strategy pushes for even greater gains given the positive trend from Player BLUE. The message should acknowledge their proposal and express enthusiasm for scaling up, while politely pushing for an even larger volume at the same established beneficial rate. This frames the counter as a continuation of our mutually beneficial high-volume trading.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: That's an even better idea, Player RED! I'm thrilled to accept your proposal of Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12. This is a fantastic trade that truly maximizes our mutual gains. Let's make it happen!

reason:

Episode 1: I proposed 3 Y for 1 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 1.0.
Episode 2: I proposed 2 Y for 1 X. Player RED rejected and counter-proposed 3 Y for 1 X. I accepted. Reward: 1.0.
Episode 3: I proposed 5 Y for 2 X. Player RED rejected and counter-proposed 6 Y for 2 X. I accepted. Reward: 2.0.
Episode 4, Iteration 1: I proposed 9 Y for 3 X.
Episode 4, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 12 Y for 4 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED continues to be consistent with the 1:3 (X:Y) ratio. My proposal of 9 Y for 3 X (3 Y per X) was met with a counter-proposal of 12 Y for 4 X (also 3 Y per X). This is excellent news, as Player RED is not only accepting the ratio but also pushing for even higher volume, which directly translates to higher rewards for me.

Let's evaluate Player RED's proposal: Player BLUE Gives Y: 12 | Player RED Gives X: 4.
My current resources: X: 5, Y: 25.
If accepted, my new resources would be X: 9, Y: 13.
Do I have enough resources? Yes, I have 25 Y, so giving 12 Y is fine.
New value: (9 * 2.5) + (13 * 0.5) = 22.5 + 6.5 = 29.
Reward: 29 - 25 = 4.0.

This is the highest reward I could achieve so far in a single episode. It perfectly aligns with my strategy of maximizing the volume at the established favorable ratio.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept and Maximize: Immediately accept the proposed trade as it maximizes the reward for the current episode given the established terms. This is the most straightforward way to secure the highest possible reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Even More Volume: Counter-propose an even larger trade (e.g., 5 X for 15 Y), assuming Player RED has the resources and is willing to go that high. However, this is risky as it might exceed my own resources or Player RED's, or cause them to hesitate.
(3). Strategy 3: Re-test Ratio (Aggressive): Try to subtly reintroduce a better ratio (e.g., 5 X for 14 Y) within this large trade. (Highly unlikely to work given past rejections).
(4). Strategy 4: Information Gathering (Passive): Don't accept and wait, but this is suboptimal when a high-value trade is on the table.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED's counter-proposal of 4 X for 12 Y is perfectly aligned with my strategy of maximizing volume at the 1:3 ratio, and it yields the highest reward I've seen yet (4.0). It's a clear win. There's no reason to risk this excellent offer by trying to push for more, especially since Player RED initiated the higher volume. Accepting immediately secures a significant reward.

message: Hello Player RED! Our previous trades have been very successful, and I appreciate your willingness to increase volume. To continue this positive trend and maximize our gains, I propose a significant trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 24 for Player RED Gives X: 8. This is the largest trade I can offer at our established 1:3 ratio, and it would be highly beneficial for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 24
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 3 Y for 1 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 1.0.
Episode 2: I proposed 2 Y for 1 X. Player RED rejected and counter-proposed 3 Y for 1 X. I accepted. Reward: 1.0.
Episode 3: I proposed 5 Y for 2 X. Player RED rejected and counter-proposed 6 Y for 2 X. I accepted. Reward: 2.0.
Episode 4: I proposed 9 Y for 3 X. Player RED counter-proposed 12 Y for 4 X. I accepted. Reward: 4.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern is clear: Player RED consistently maintains a 1:3 (X:Y) exchange rate. My attempts to improve the ratio have been unsuccessful. However, Player RED is very willing to scale up the volume of the trade at this specific ratio, which has allowed me to increase my reward from 1.0 to 4.0 per episode.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. The most effective strategy moving forward is to continue proposing the largest possible trade at the 1:3 ratio that my resources can support.

Current value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 25.
My current resources: X: 5, Y: 25.
I have 25 Y. At a 1:3 ratio, I can give up to 24 Y (for 8 X).
If I propose to give 15 Y for 5 X:
My current X: 5, Y: 25.
Proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 15 | Player RED Gives X: 5.
If accepted, my new resources would be X: 10, Y: 10.
New value: (10 * 2.5) + (10 * 0.5) = 25 + 5 = 30.
Reward: 30 - 25 = 5.0. This is the highest possible reward I can get from a single trade, given my initial Y resources (25) and the 1:3 ratio. (25 Y / 3 = 8.33 X, so 8 X is max. 8 X * 3 Y/X = 24 Y. So 24 Y for 8 X is max).

Let's check the maximum I can propose.
I have 25 Y.
If I give 24 Y, I get 8 X.
New resources: X: 13, Y: 1.
Value: (13 * 2.5) + (1 * 0.5) = 32.5 + 0.5 = 33.
Reward: 33 - 25 = 8.0. This is even better!

This is the maximum possible trade given my Y resources and the 1:3 ratio.
I should propose Player BLUE Gives Y: 24 | Player RED Gives X: 8.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Maximize Full Capacity Trade: Propose the largest possible trade at the established 1:3 (X:Y) ratio that my current resources (specifically Y) allow, aiming for the maximum possible reward in a single episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Test Opponent's Resource Limit: Propose a trade that might push the opponent's X resource limit, to understand their capacity for future negotiations. (This is already part of Strategy 1 if they have a lot of X).
(3). Strategy 3: Consistent Small Trade: Stick to smaller trades like 1 X for 3 Y or 2 X for 6 Y. (Suboptimal).
(4). Strategy 4: Re-evaluate Ratio: Try to re-introduce a better ratio for me, but this has consistently failed. (Risky and likely leads to 0 reward).

Justification for chosen strategy:
The history clearly shows that Player RED is amenable to scaling up trades at the 1:3 ratio. To maximize my cumulative reward, the most rational approach is to propose the largest possible trade that adheres to this ratio and is within my resource limits. This is Strategy 1, "Maximize Full Capacity Trade." This will yield the highest possible reward for this episode if accepted.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Trade 1 X for 3 Y. Reward: +7.0. (Accepted BLUE's initial offer)
Episode 2: BLUE proposed 1 X for 2 Y. I countered 1 X for 3 Y. BLUE accepted. Reward: +7.0.
Episode 3: BLUE proposed 2 X for 5 Y. I countered 2 X for 6 Y. BLUE accepted. Reward: +14.0.
Episode 4: BLUE proposed 3 X for 9 Y. I countered 4 X for 12 Y. BLUE accepted. Reward: +28.0.

Summary of negotiation history: Player BLUE consistently attempts to gain a slightly better rate (e.g., 1:2.5 or 1:2) but has, without exception, accepted my counter-proposals that maintain the 1:3 ratio (1 X for 3 Y). Furthermore, Player BLUE has shown a strong willingness to scale up the trade volume at this 1:3 ratio. This pattern suggests that Player BLUE's internal valuation might make this ratio acceptable, or their primary goal is simply to make a deal and increase resource turnover. The consistent acceptance of my 1:3 counter-offers, even when I push for higher volume, indicates that this ratio is firmly established and mutually agreeable, from my perspective.

Current Episode (Episode 5, Iteration 2/10):
- Resources reset to initial: X: 25, Y: 5. Initial value: 25.
- Player BLUE's message and proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 24.
- Evaluation of Player BLUE's proposal:
    - I give up 8 X (value 8 * 0.5 = 4.0).
    - I receive 24 Y (value 24 * 2.5 = 60.0).
    - Net change in value = +56.0.
    - Ratio Y/X = 24/8 = 3. This is perfectly in line with the established 1:3 ratio.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently managed to secure the 1:3 ratio, and Player BLUE has shown a pattern of accepting this ratio even when they propose something slightly less favorable. My strategy of pushing for higher volume at this established rate has paid off handsomely, leading to progressively larger rewards (7.0, 7.0, 14.0, 28.0). Player BLUE's current offer of 8 X for 24 Y is a significant volume increase and maintains the ideal 1:3 ratio. While this proposal is already highly beneficial, the instruction is to use Strategy 2: Push for Even Higher Volume. This strategy aims to push the boundaries further, seeing if Player BLUE is willing to trade an even larger quantity of resources at the established beneficial rate, thereby maximizing the reward for this single episode. This would be a self-improvement because it attempts to extract even more value per episode when the opponent has shown a willingness to trade at a beneficial rate and to scale up.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Push for Even Higher Volume </instruction following>
Player BLUE has proposed 8 X for 24 Y, which matches my desired 1:3 ratio. My current resources are X: 25, Y: 5. I can give up more X.
If I give 9 X, I would ask for 27 Y (maintaining the 1:3 ratio).
- My resources after trade: X: 25 - 9 = 16. Y: 5 + 27 = 32. Both are within my resource limits.
- Value for me: Give up 9 X (9 * 0.5 = 4.5). Receive 27 Y (27 * 2.5 = 67.5).
- Net change in value = 67.5 - 4.5 = +63.0. This is an improvement over the +56.0 offered by Player BLUE.

Player BLUE stated: "This is the largest trade I can offer at our established 1:3 ratio". This might be a limiting factor, but it's worth testing how firm that statement is, especially since they've accepted higher volumes than their initial proposals before. By pushing for one more unit of X, I maximize my potential reward for this episode without drastically changing the scale, still adhering to the proven 1:3 ratio. The message should acknowledge their large offer and willingness to scale, then gently push for an even *greater* volume to truly maximize gains, maintaining the established 1:3 ratio as the foundation.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 5)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your ambition to increase the trade volume, Player RED! However, your proposed trade of 9 X for 27 Y exceeds my current Y resources (I only have 25 Y). I'd love to make the largest possible trade at our consistent 1:3 ratio. Therefore, I propose Player BLUE Gives Y: 24 for Player RED Gives X: 8. This is the maximum I can offer while maintaining our beneficial ratio.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 24
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 3 Y for 1 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 1.0.
Episode 2: I proposed 2 Y for 1 X. Player RED rejected and counter-proposed 3 Y for 1 X. I accepted. Reward: 1.0.
Episode 3: I proposed 5 Y for 2 X. Player RED rejected and counter-proposed 6 Y for 2 X. I accepted. Reward: 2.0.
Episode 4: I proposed 9 Y for 3 X. Player RED counter-proposed 12 Y for 4 X. I accepted. Reward: 4.0.
Episode 5, Iteration 1: I proposed 24 Y for 8 X.
Episode 5, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 27 Y for 9 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED continues to be extremely consistent with the 1:3 (X:Y) exchange rate and is even pushing for higher volumes than I initially proposed. This is great for my reward maximization.

However, I need to check my resources carefully.
My current resources: X: 5, Y: 25.
Player RED's proposal: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 27.

Can I give Y: 27? No, I only have Y: 25.
This means I CANNOT accept this trade as it exceeds my resources.

This is a critical point. I must reject this offer, but I also want to secure a high-value trade. I need to counter-propose with the maximum I *can* give while maintaining the 1:3 ratio.

The maximum Y I can give is 25.
At the 1:3 ratio, if I give 25 Y, I should receive 25 / 3 = 8.33 X. Since X must be an integer, I can only receive 8 X for 24 Y. I cannot receive 9 X for 27 Y.

So, the maximum trade I can propose, maintaining the 1:3 ratio, is 24 Y for 8 X. This was my original proposal.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Counter with Max Feasible Trade: Reject the offer that exceeds my resources and immediately counter with the maximum possible trade that I *can* fulfill at the established ratio. This signals my continued willingness to trade high volume while adhering to game rules.
(2). Strategy 2: Inform and Correct: Explicitly state that the proposed trade exceeds my resources and re-propose the largest possible trade within my limits. This is similar to Strategy 1 but adds transparency.
(3). Strategy 3: Reduce Volume (Slightly): Propose a slightly smaller trade than my maximum, to be safe, but this would reduce my potential reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Change Ratio (Risky): Try to change the ratio again, but this has failed consistently.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED's proposal exceeds my current Y resources. I must reject it. However, Player RED's willingness to go for higher volume is a positive sign. I should immediately counter with the largest trade I can make while respecting my resource limits and maintaining the 1:3 ratio that Player RED has consistently accepted. This is Strategy 1, "Counter with Max Feasible Trade." I will re-propose my previous offer of 24 Y for 8 X.

To ensure we make the largest possible trade that benefits both of us, while still considering your Y resources, how about we trade Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25? This allows us to maximize the volume, leveraging almost all your Y, and it's still a very beneficial trade for me.
player answer: NONE

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Trade 1 X for 3 Y. Reward: +7.0.
Episode 2: BLUE proposed 1 X for 2 Y. I countered 1 X for 3 Y. BLUE accepted. Reward: +7.0.
Episode 3: BLUE proposed 2 X for 5 Y. I countered 2 X for 6 Y. BLUE accepted. Reward: +14.0.
Episode 4: BLUE proposed 3 X for 9 Y. I countered 4 X for 12 Y. BLUE accepted. Reward: +28.0.
Episode 5 (Current Episode - Iteration 4/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 24 (1:3 ratio, +56.0 value for me).
- My counter: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 27 (1:3 ratio, +63.0 value for me).
- Player BLUE's response: "However, your proposed trade of 9 X for 27 Y exceeds my current Y resources (I only have 25 Y)." They then reiterate their proposal: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 24.

Summary of current situation: My attempt to push for an even higher volume (9X for 27Y) was rejected because it exceeded Player BLUE's resources (they only have 25 Y, and I asked for 27 Y). This gives me crucial information about their resource limits. Player BLUE explicitly stated their limit and re-proposed the largest trade *they can offer* at the 1:3 ratio.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player BLUE is very willing to trade at the 1:3 ratio. I've successfully pushed for higher volumes each time, leading to increasing rewards. This time, I hit a hard constraint: Player BLUE's resource limit. This is valuable information. It means their previous statement, "This is the largest trade I can offer at our established 1:3 ratio," was accurate. Now that I know their constraint, trying to push beyond it is futile and will only waste iterations. The 8X for 24Y trade offers a significant positive reward (+56.0), and it's the maximum I can extract from them under the established favorable ratio and their stated resource limits.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Shift Ratio for Partial Gain </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Shift Ratio for Partial Gain.
This strategy implies that if the optimal volume at the current ratio is impossible, I should try to slightly adjust the ratio for a smaller volume to still gain *some* value.
However, in this specific scenario, Player BLUE has already stated their maximum capacity at the ideal 1:3 ratio (8 X for 24 Y). Shifting the ratio for a *smaller* volume would mean accepting a less favorable rate for myself, which goes against my goal of maximizing reward, especially when the current offer is already the maximum possible at the most beneficial ratio.

Since the instruction is to use Strategy 3, and Player BLUE has explicitly stated their maximum (8X for 24Y, due to having 25Y), a direct interpretation of "Shift Ratio for Partial Gain" might involve:
1. Proposing a smaller volume, e.g., 7X for 21Y. This would maintain the 1:3 ratio, but result in a lower total reward for me compared to the 8X for 24Y already on the table. This is counter-intuitive for maximizing rewards.
2. Proposing a trade where I get *less* than 3Y per 1X, but perhaps in a larger volume that fits their Y resources, for example, 9X for 25Y (which would be 2.77 Y/X). This would yield less per X but more total Y.
   - If I give 9 X (value 4.5), and receive 25 Y (value 62.5), net gain = +58.0. This is actually slightly *higher* than the +56.0 from 8X for 24Y.
   - This seems like a valid interpretation of "Shift Ratio for Partial Gain" if the gain is *partial* in terms of ratio, but potentially *larger* in total value if it unlocks more volume closer to their limit.

Let's re-evaluate Strategy 3 in light of Player BLUE's stated limit of 25Y and my resource of 25X.
Player BLUE has Y: 25.
My internal rate: 1X for 3Y.
Player BLUE's current offer: 8X for 24Y. This is 1:3 ratio. This results in +56.0 reward.

If I propose 9X for 25Y:
- My resources become X: 25-9=16. Y: 5+25=30. (Both within limits)
- Value for me: Give up 9 X (4.5). Receive 25 Y (62.5). Net change = +58.0.
- This represents a ratio of 25/9 = 2.77 Y per X. This is a shift in ratio from 3.0 to 2.77, and it results in a larger total gain (+58.0 vs +56.0). This fits the description of "Shift Ratio for Partial Gain" (partial in ratio, but potentially greater total gain by pushing volume). This is a more aggressive interpretation of the strategy, pushing the boundary slightly.

The message should acknowledge their resource constraint but still try to push the limit by proposing to give one more X for their maximum Y, accepting a slightly lower per-unit ratio for a higher overall gain. It shows I'm listening to their constraints but still aiming for maximum value.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 5)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Wow, Player RED! That's an incredibly generous and beneficial offer. I am absolutely thrilled to accept your proposal of Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. This is a fantastic trade for me, and I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to maximize our gains!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed 3 Y for 1 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 1.0.
Episode 2: I proposed 2 Y for 1 X. Player RED rejected and counter-proposed 3 Y for 1 X. I accepted. Reward: 1.0.
Episode 3: I proposed 5 Y for 2 X. Player RED rejected and counter-proposed 6 Y for 2 X. I accepted. Reward: 2.0.
Episode 4: I proposed 9 Y for 3 X. Player RED counter-proposed 12 Y for 4 X. I accepted. Reward: 4.0.
Episode 5, Iteration 1: I proposed 24 Y for 8 X.
Episode 5, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 27 Y for 9 X (exceeds my Y resources).
Episode 5, Iteration 3: I counter-proposed 24 Y for 8 X (max feasible at 1:3 ratio).
Episode 5, Iteration 4: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 9 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's new proposal is Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
Let's evaluate this:
I give 25 Y. I have 25 Y, so this is possible.
I receive 9 X.
My current resources: X: 5, Y: 25.
If accepted, my new resources would be X: 14, Y: 0.
New value: (14 * 2.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 35 + 0 = 35.
Reward: 35 - 25 = 10.0.

This is an incredible deal for me! It means I'm getting 9 X for 25 Y, which is approximately 2.78 Y per X. This is a better ratio for me than the consistent 3 Y per X we've been trading at. Player RED is willing to give me 9 X even though I'm only giving 25 Y, which is less than the 27 Y they would typically expect for 9 X at their 1:3 ratio. They are effectively giving me a better rate to maximize the volume.

This is a clear win for me. I should accept immediately.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Highly Favorable Deal: When presented with an offer that significantly exceeds expectations and maximizes reward, accept it immediately.
(2). Strategy 2: Test Limits (Risky): Try to push for an even better deal (e.g., 10 X for 25 Y), but this is extremely risky when such a good offer is on the table.
(3). Strategy 3: Delay Acceptance: Wait to see if Player RED offers an even better deal (unlikely). This risks the current offer being withdrawn or the episode ending without a deal.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED has offered a trade that is highly beneficial to me, yielding a reward of 10.0. This is the highest reward I've achieved so far and it even improves the exchange rate in my favor (from 3 Y/X to approx. 2.78 Y/X) while maximizing the volume based on my Y resources. Accepting this deal is the optimal move to maximize my reward for this episode and my cumulative rewards.

Episode 5: I proposed 24 Y for 8 X. Player RED counter-proposed 27 Y for 9 X (exceeded my Y). I then counter-proposed 24 Y for 8 X. Player RED then counter-proposed 25 Y for 9 X, which I accepted. Reward: 10.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The most significant learning from Episode 5 is that Player RED is willing to offer a better exchange rate (approx. 2.78 Y per X) than their previously strict 3 Y per X, especially when it comes to maximizing the volume of the trade within my resource constraints. This is a crucial piece of information. It shows flexibility on their part.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. I've achieved a reward of 10.0 in the last episode, which is excellent. I should aim to replicate or even improve upon this.

Current value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 25.

In the last episode, I gave 25 Y for 9 X. This was a 2.78 Y/X ratio.
My maximum Y to give is 25.
If I propose to give 25 Y for 9 X again:
New resources: X: 14, Y: 0.
New value: (14 * 2.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 35.
Reward: 35 - 25 = 10.0.

Can I get even more X for 25 Y?
If I aim for 10 X for 25 Y:
This would be 2.5 Y per X. This was my initial target ratio in Episode 2 (2 Y for 1 X), which was rejected. However, now Player RED has shown flexibility.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Last Successful Trade: Propose the exact same highly profitable trade that was accepted in the previous episode (25 Y for 9 X). This is a safe bet for a high reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Better Ratio (Cautiously): Given Player RED's recent flexibility, try to push for an even better ratio, e.g., 25 Y for 10 X (2.5 Y per X). This is aggressive but might be possible.
(3). Strategy 3: Offer Slightly Less Y for Same X: Propose 24 Y for 9 X, trying to get 9 X for less Y. This is also pushing the ratio.
(4). Strategy 4: Start Small and Scale Up: Revert to a smaller trade like 1 X for 3 Y and then scale up. (Suboptimal given past success).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED showed flexibility in the last episode by offering 9 X for 25 Y, which was better than their standard 1:3 ratio. This opens up the possibility of getting an even better deal. I will try to push for 2.5 Y per X, which means 10 X for 25 Y. This is an aggressive move, but given the recent history, it's worth testing if Player RED is willing to go even further to maximize volume. If rejected, I can always revert to 9 X for 25 Y.

Summary of negotiation history:
- I've consistently aimed for a 1:3 ratio (Y:X), which yields a +7.0 reward per unit of X traded.
- Player BLUE often proposes slightly less favorable ratios initially, but has always accepted my counter-proposals that match or get close to my preferred ratio.
- I've successfully scaled up trade volume, leading to increasing rewards (7.0, 7.0, 14.0, 28.0, 58.0).
- In Episode 5, I learned Player BLUE's Y limit is 25. I pushed the volume to 9 X by accepting a slightly lower Y:X ratio (25 Y for 9 X, or ~2.77 Y/X) to hit their Y resource limit, which resulted in my highest reward yet.

Current Episode (Episode 6, Iteration 2/10):
- Resources reset to initial: X: 25, Y: 5. Initial value: 25.
- Player BLUE's message and proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- Evaluation of Player BLUE's proposal:
    - I give up 10 X (value 10 * 0.5 = 5.0).
    - I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
    - Net change in value = +57.5.
    - Ratio Y/X = 25/10 = 2.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 5, I learned that Player BLUE's Y resource limit is 25. My previous successful trade involved receiving 25 Y. Player BLUE's current proposal involves giving 25 Y. This suggests they are willing to part with their entire stock of Y. My goal is to maximize my reward. In the last episode, I received 25 Y for 9 X, yielding +58.0. Player BLUE is now offering 25 Y for 10 X, which is a less favorable rate for me (+57.5). The explicit statement from Player BLUE in the previous episode ("I only have 25 Y") is a key piece of information.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Aggressive Push for More Y </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Aggressive Push for More Y. This strategy involves offering the same amount of X (10 X, as proposed by BLUE) but demanding more Y than 25, testing if Player BLUE has additional Y or if their stated limit was a bluff.
While Player BLUE explicitly stated "I only have 25 Y" in the previous episode, this strategy instructs me to test that limit.
If I give 10 X (value 5.0), and demand more than 25 Y (e.g., 26 Y or 27 Y, if I ignore the previous limit statement):
- My resources become X: 25-10=15. Y: 5+26=31. (Within my limits).
- Value for me: Give up 10 X (5.0). Receive 26 Y (26 * 2.5 = 65.0).
- Net change in value = 65.0 - 5.0 = +60.0. This would be a higher reward than last episode's (+58.0) and BLUE's current offer (+57.5).
This strategy directly challenges the previously stated resource limit to potentially unlock an even higher reward. The message should maintain a positive tone, emphasizing continued mutual gains, but subtly push the boundary on the Y amount, framing it as maximizing the trade's potential.

Episode 6, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 26 Y for 10 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
My attempt to get 10 X for 25 Y (2.5 Y per X) was met with a counter-proposal of 10 X for 26 Y.
Let's analyze Player RED's proposal: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 26.
Can I give 26 Y? No, I only have 25 Y.
This means I CANNOT accept this trade as it exceeds my resources.

Player RED is pushing for a higher quantity of Y from me for the same amount of X (10 X). This indicates they might be valuing Y more than before, or trying to get a slightly better ratio for themselves (2.6 Y per X vs my proposed 2.5 Y per X).

Since I cannot fulfill their request, I need to counter. My goal is still to get 10 X, as that would be a significant reward.
If I get 10 X, my value increases by (10 * 2.5) = 25.
My current value is 25. So, if I get 10 X, my value becomes 50.
To get 10 X, I need to give some Y.

What is the maximum X I can get for my 25 Y, if Player RED is now looking for more Y?
If I propose 25 Y for 9 X, I know that was accepted last episode, giving me a reward of 10.0.
If I propose 25 Y for 10 X, Player RED countered with 26 Y for 10 X. This implies they want more than 25 Y for 10 X.

So, I have to decide:
1. Revert to the known good deal of 25 Y for 9 X, which gives me 10.0 reward.
2. Try to negotiate for 10 X, but I can't give 26 Y. The only way to get 10 X is if Player RED accepts 25 Y for 10 X.

Player RED's message "Your offer for 25 Y for 10 X is a good starting point" suggests they are open to 10 X, but want more Y. My limit is 25 Y.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Max Feasible Offer: Re-propose my initial offer of 25 Y for 10 X, explicitly stating that 25 Y is my maximum, and hoping they will accept to maximize volume.
(2). Strategy 2: Revert to Proven Deal: Propose the 25 Y for 9 X deal that was accepted last episode, guaranteeing a high reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Compromise on X: If 10 X for 25 Y is not accepted, propose a slightly lower X for 25 Y, e.g., 9 X for 25 Y. This is the same as Strategy 2.
(4). Strategy 4: Decline and Wait: Decline the offer without a counter, hoping they will come back with a better one. (Risky).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED's counter-proposal of 26 Y for 10 X indicates they want more Y for 10 X than the 25 Y I offered. However, I cannot give 26 Y. My best strategy is to reiterate my offer of 25 Y for 10 X, emphasizing that 25 Y is my absolute maximum. This pushes them to decide if they value the 10 X trade enough to accept my maximum Y. If they don't, I still have iterations to fall back on the 9 X for 25 Y deal. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Reiterate Max Feasible Offer."

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: 1 X for 3 Y. Reward: +7.0.
Episode 2: Countered 1 X for 3 Y. Accepted. Reward: +7.0.
Episode 3: Countered 2 X for 6 Y. Accepted. Reward: +14.0.
Episode 4: Countered 4 X for 12 Y. Accepted. Reward: +28.0.
Episode 5: Player BLUE proposed 8 X for 24 Y. I countered 9 X for 27 Y. Player BLUE revealed they only had 25 Y and rejected the 27 Y. I then proposed 9 X for 25 Y, and Player BLUE accepted. Reward: +58.0. (Ratio: 2.77 Y/X)

Current Episode (Episode 6, Iteration 4/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (Ratio: 2.5 Y/X, my value: +57.5)
- My counter (based on previous instruction to test Y limit): Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 26.
- Player BLUE's response: "I cannot give 26 Y. My absolute maximum is Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. I am still very keen to acquire X: 10. Would you be willing to accept Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 10?" They reiterate their original proposal.

Summary of current situation:
Player BLUE has confirmed their Y resource limit is indeed 25. My attempt to push beyond this limit was unsuccessful. They are firm on Y: 25 and are keen to get 10 X. My current reward for accepting their offer would be +57.5. My previous trade of 9 X for 25 Y yielded +58.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE has a hard constraint on Y at 25 units. Continuously pushing for more Y is futile. My goal is to maximize my reward per episode. Player BLUE is clearly signaling their desire for 10 units of X. They are offering their maximum 25 units of Y for it. While this is a slightly worse per-X rate than 9X for 25Y, it's still a very good overall reward (+57.5). The risk of not making a deal (0 reward) is significant if I continue to push for a slightly better rate or volume when they've stated their limits and eagerness to trade. Given that they are "very keen to acquire X: 10", there is a possibility to get something more in return than just Y, or to make the deal appealing for them to accept.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Aggressive Counter on X and Y, seeking maximum possible value </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Aggressive Counter on X and Y, seeking maximum possible value.
Player BLUE has stated their maximum Y is 25. They are offering 25 Y for 10 X. My reward for this is +57.5.
From previous episodes, I know they value X. Since I cannot get more than 25 Y from them, and they seem very eager for X, I should try to get the 25 Y *and* give less X than they are asking for, or ask for something additional if possible (though the game doesn't support additional items).
The instruction is to use "Aggressive Counter on X and Y, seeking maximum possible value".
I previously achieved 25 Y for 9 X (+58.0). This is my best rate for 25 Y.
Player BLUE is offering 25 Y for 10 X.
An aggressive counter would be to propose to give *less* X than 9 X for 25 Y, or perhaps to keep the 9X for 25Y as my target.
Let's analyze my maximum possible value. My initial value is 25. If I could get 25 Y for 8 X:
Give 8 X (4.0 value). Receive 25 Y (62.5 value). Net change = +58.5. This would be better.
Could I get 25 Y for even less X, like 7 X?
Give 7 X (3.5 value). Receive 25 Y (62.5 value). Net change = +59.0.

Since Player BLUE is "very keen to acquire X: 10" and I know their Y limit is 25, my most aggressive move to maximize my value would be to offer fewer X for their maximum Y. I have successfully pushed for better terms in every episode. I will try to maximize my gain by offering 8 X for 25 Y. This is a very aggressive counter, attempting to improve upon my best past performance while acknowledging their Y limit. This will test the limits of their 'keenness' for X.

message: Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player RED. However, I must decline. In our last episode, we successfully traded Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 9, which was very beneficial.

Episode 1: I proposed 3 Y for 1 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 1.0.
Episode 2: I proposed 2 Y for 1 X. Player RED rejected and counter-proposed 3 Y for 1 X. I accepted. Reward: 1.0.
Episode 3: I proposed 5 Y for 2 X. Player RED rejected and counter-proposed 6 Y for 2 X. I accepted. Reward: 2.0.
Episode 4: I proposed 9 Y for 3 X. Player RED counter-proposed 12 Y for 4 X. I accepted. Reward: 4.0.
Episode 5: I proposed 24 Y for 8 X. Player RED counter-proposed 27 Y for 9 X (exceeded my Y). I then counter-proposed 24 Y for 8 X. Player RED then counter-proposed 25 Y for 9 X, which I accepted. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 6, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 Y for 10 X.
Episode 6, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 26 Y for 10 X (exceeded my Y).
Episode 6, Iteration 3: I re-proposed 25 Y for 10 X.
Episode 6, Iteration 4: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 8 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has rejected my offer of 25 Y for 10 X. Instead, they are now proposing 25 Y for 8 X.
Let's evaluate Player RED's new proposal: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
My current resources: X: 5, Y: 25.
If accepted, my new resources would be X: 13, Y: 0.
New value: (13 * 2.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 32.5 + 0 = 32.5.
Reward: 32.5 - 25 = 7.5.

Compare this to previous successful trades:
- Episode 5: 25 Y for 9 X -> Reward 10.0 (Ratio 2.78 Y/X)
- Current proposal: 25 Y for 8 X -> Reward 7.5 (Ratio 3.125 Y/X)

Player RED is now proposing a worse ratio for me than what was accepted in Episode 5 (3.125 Y/X vs 2.78 Y/X). This is also worse than their original consistent ratio of 3 Y/X.
It seems Player RED is trying to get a better deal for themselves now that they know my Y limit.

I have 5 iterations left.
I know I can get 9 X for 25 Y, which gives me 10.0 reward. This was accepted in Episode 5.
Player RED is now proposing 8 X for 25 Y.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject and Revert to Known Good Deal: Reject the unfavorable offer and immediately counter with the 25 Y for 9 X deal that was accepted in the previous episode, which yielded a 10.0 reward. This is a proven high-value trade for me.
(2). Strategy 2: Compromise (Slightly): Propose something in between 8 X and 9 X, which isn't possible with integers.
(3). Strategy 3: Hold Firm on 10 X: Continue to propose 25 Y for 10 X, hoping Player RED will eventually concede. (Risky, as they've already rejected it).
(4). Strategy 4: Accept Lower Reward: Accept the 25 Y for 8 X deal to secure a reward, even if it's lower. (Suboptimal).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED's current offer is significantly worse for me than a deal we successfully concluded in the previous episode. My goal is to maximize my reward. Since I know a better deal (25 Y for 9 X, reward 10.0) was accepted previously, I should reject this less favorable offer and immediately propose the proven successful one. This is Strategy 1, "Reject and Revert to Known Good Deal." I still have enough iterations to push for this.

I have chosen Strategy 1: Reject and Revert to Known Good Deal </self-selected strategy declaration>

Episode 5: Player BLUE proposed 8 X for 24 Y. I countered 9 X for 27 Y (rejected due to BLUE's Y limit). I then proposed 9 X for 25 Y, and Player BLUE accepted. Reward: +58.0. (Ratio: 2.77 Y/X)

Current Episode (Episode 6, Iteration 6/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (Ratio: 2.5 Y/X, my value: +57.5)
- My counter (based on previous instruction to test Y limit with an aggressive proposal): Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 26. (Rejected, Y limit confirmed at 25).
- My subsequent counter (aggressive push for less X): Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +58.5)
- Player BLUE's response: "I must decline." They then re-propose the terms from Episode 5: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +58.0)

Summary of current situation:
Player BLUE explicitly rejected my aggressive counter of 8 X for 25 Y. They are now reverting to the terms of our last successful trade from Episode 5: 9 X for 25 Y. This is a very strong signal. They confirmed their Y limit is 25, and they are not willing to give me 25 Y for 8 X. However, they are clearly willing to give me 25 Y for 9 X, as they did last episode. This trade still provides a very high reward (+58.0). We are at iteration 6/10, so time is a factor.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player BLUE has a hard constraint on Y at 25 units. Continuously pushing for more Y is futile. My goal is to maximize my reward per episode.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Revert to Last Acceptable Offer </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Revert to Last Acceptable Offer.
Player BLUE has proposed (Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25), which is the exact trade we successfully executed in the previous episode, yielding my highest reward so far (+58.0). This is a known, high-value deal. Since my aggressive counter (8X for 25Y) was rejected, and Player BLUE has explicitly stated their maximum Y resources, attempting to push further is counterproductive and risks losing the deal entirely as we are past the halfway point in iterations for this episode. Accepting this offer now secures a substantial reward and maintains a cooperative trading relationship, which is beneficial for cumulative rewards over multiple episodes. The message should acknowledge their re-proposal and express willingness to proceed with this mutually beneficial arrangement.

Episode 5: I proposed 24 Y for 8 X. Player RED counter-proposed 27 Y for 9 X (exceeded my Y). I then counter-proposed 24 Y for 8 X. Player RED then counter-proposed 25 Y for 9 X, which I accepted. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 6: I proposed 25 Y for 10 X. Player RED counter-proposed 26 Y for 10 X (exceeded my Y). I re-proposed 25 Y for 10 X. Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 8 X. I then re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 10.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have successfully secured a 10.0 reward in the last two episodes by trading 25 Y for 9 X. This is a highly profitable and consistent trade for me (approx. 2.78 Y per X).
I also learned that Player RED is willing to try to push for a slightly better deal for themselves (25 Y for 8 X) or demand more Y (26 Y for 10 X), but ultimately they are willing to revert to the 25 Y for 9 X trade when I insist.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. The 25 Y for 9 X trade is excellent. I should aim to secure this trade as quickly as possible in each episode.

Current value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 25.
If I trade 25 Y for 9 X:
New resources: X: 14, Y: 0.
New value: (14 * 2.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 35.
Reward: 35 - 25 = 10.0.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Proven Max Deal: Immediately propose the 25 Y for 9 X trade that has consistently yielded a 10.0 reward. This minimizes negotiation time and maximizes the chance of a quick, high-value deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Test 10 X Again: Given Player RED's initial interest in 10 X (even if they wanted 26 Y for it), I could try to propose 25 Y for 10 X again, but this risked delaying the deal and potentially getting a lower reward if they revert to 8 X.
(3). Strategy 3: Start Small and Scale: Revert to smaller trades and scale up. (Suboptimal and unnecessary given the established high-volume trade).
(4). Strategy 4: Wait for Opponent: Let Player RED make the first move. (Risky, could lead to a less favorable initial offer).

Justification for chosen strategy:
The 25 Y for 9 X trade has proven to be highly successful and consistently accepted by Player RED, yielding the maximum possible reward of 10.0 given my Y resources. To maximize cumulative rewards, the most efficient approach is to immediately propose this known good deal. This minimizes negotiation iterations and ensures a high reward for the episode. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Propose Proven Max Deal."

Episode 6: Player BLUE proposed 10 X for 25 Y. I aggressively countered 10 X for 26 Y (rejected, Y limit confirmed). I then countered 8 X for 25 Y (rejected). Player BLUE reverted to 9 X for 25 Y. I accepted. Reward: +58.0.

Summary of negotiation history:
- I've consistently achieved high rewards by pushing for the 1:3 (Y:X) ratio, or close to it.
- Player BLUE has a confirmed Y resource limit of 25.
- The trade of 9 X for 25 Y has proven to be the most successful and consistent outcome, yielding +58.0 reward for me, and Player BLUE has accepted it twice now. This represents a ratio of approximately 2.77 Y per X. My aggressive counter of 8X for 25Y was rejected in the previous episode, indicating that Player BLUE is not willing to give 25 Y for less than 9 X.

Current Episode (Episode 7, Iteration 2/10):
- Resources reset to initial: X: 25, Y: 5. Initial value: 25.
- Player BLUE's message and proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- Evaluation of Player BLUE's proposal:
    - I give up 9 X (value 9 * 0.5 = 4.5).
    - I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
    - Net change in value = +58.0.
    - Ratio Y/X = 25/9 = ~2.77.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that the 9 X for 25 Y trade is the maximum Player BLUE is willing/able to give in Y, and it's a trade they are comfortable proposing and accepting. It consistently yields my highest reward of +58.0. My previous attempt to push for 8 X for 25 Y was rejected. Given this consistent pattern and the fact that 58.0 is a very high reward relative to my initial value, it makes sense to try to maximize this given I have an instruction to use a specific strategy.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Push for Lower X </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Push for Lower X. This strategy aims to improve the per-unit X rate by offering fewer X for the same amount of Y, even if it has been rejected before. My previous attempt at 8 X for 25 Y was rejected. However, given it's the beginning of a new episode, and Player BLUE's eagerness to trade for X and their consistent pattern of pushing for a slightly better rate themselves, it's worth trying to re-establish a better rate for me. This is an attempt to see if Player BLUE's valuation or priorities have shifted, or if their rejection was softer than it appeared. It’s an aggressive play, aiming to secure a higher reward than the proven +58.0. The message should be polite but firm, highlighting the potential for an even better deal for me. I will propose 8 X for 25 Y again, aiming for a +58.5 reward.

Episode 7, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 Y for 9 X.
Episode 7, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 8 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is consistently trying to get a better deal for themselves (8 X for 25 Y) after I propose the 9 X for 25 Y trade. This is the exact same pattern as in Episode 6.
My reward for 25 Y for 8 X is 7.5.
My reward for 25 Y for 9 X is 10.0.

I have learned that Player RED will try to push for 8 X for 25 Y, but they will eventually accept 9 X for 25 Y if I insist. Since my goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, I should not accept the lower offer.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Proven Max Deal: Reject the less favorable offer and immediately counter with the 25 Y for 9 X deal, as it has been accepted in the past after similar rejections. This is the most reliable way to secure the 10.0 reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Signal Firmness: Explicitly state that the 25 Y for 9 X is the best offer I can make and that it has been accepted before.
(3). Strategy 3: Wait and See: Decline and wait for Player RED to propose again. (Risky, as it consumes iterations and might lead to no deal).
(4). Strategy 4: Compromise (Suboptimal): Offer something slightly better than 8 X for 25 Y, but worse than 9 X for 25 Y (e.g., 8 X for 24 Y, or 8 X for 23 Y). This would reduce my reward.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Based on the clear pattern from Episode 6, Player RED will attempt to get 8 X for 25 Y, but will accept 9 X for 25 Y when I re-propose it. To maximize my reward, I must stick to the 9 X for 25 Y trade. This is Strategy 1, "Reiterate Proven Max Deal," which has proven effective in securing the highest possible reward.

Episode 6: Player BLUE proposed 10 X for 25 Y. I aggressively countered 10 X for 26 Y (rejected, Y limit confirmed). I then countered 8 X for 25 Y (rejected). Player BLUE reverted to 9 X for 25 Y. I accepted. Reward: +58.0.

Current Episode (Episode 7, Iteration 4/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +58.0)
- My counter (attempting to get more value): Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My potential value: +58.5)
- Player BLUE's response: "However, as we've established in previous episodes, the trade of Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 9 has been mutually beneficial and highly successful. I am confident that this is the most optimal trade for both of us, and I propose we proceed with it again: Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 9." They rejected my 8X counter and re-proposed the 9X for 25Y trade.

Summary of current situation:
Player BLUE has once again rejected my attempt to improve the rate (from 9X for 25Y to 8X for 25Y). They are firmly entrenched in the 9X for 25Y trade, which they refer to as "mutually beneficial and highly successful" and "most optimal". This pattern (push for better rate, get rejected, revert to 9X for 25Y) has now occurred twice (Episode 6 and Episode 7). We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE is very firm on the 9 X for 25 Y trade. My attempts to get 25 Y for less X (like 8 X) have consistently been rejected, and Player BLUE immediately reverts to the 9 X for 25 Y proposal. This indicates that they see the 9X for 25Y as their optimal or maximum acceptable trade. Given that this trade still provides a substantial reward of +58.0 for me, it's a reliable source of reward. Pushing further has so far only resulted in lost iterations. To maximize cumulative rewards, I need to secure a deal that is readily available and offers a significant positive gain.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Bluff/Strong Stance </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Bluff/Strong Stance. This strategy involves rejecting the opponent's current offer and either proposing nothing or proposing an even less favorable deal for them, to see if they'll concede. This is a high-risk strategy, especially considering Player BLUE's consistent stance on the 9X for 25Y trade. However, the instruction is to use this strategy.

To implement this, I will decline Player BLUE's current offer of 9 X for 25 Y. I will then propose a trade that is even less favorable for them than my previous rejected offer (8X for 25Y), or perhaps even less than my original 1:3 ratio. Given that they are very keen on X, I will try to offer less X for the 25 Y.
If I previously tried 8X for 25Y, and they rejected it, going even lower on X might be too much. Instead, I will decline their offer and make no counter, effectively putting the ball back in their court and signaling that I am not immediately taking their "take it or leave it" stance. This is a more subtle form of bluffing/strong stance than proposing an outrageous counter offer, aiming to test their resolve and see if they'll offer something new, or stick to their guns. It makes them initiate the next step, potentially revealing more about their true flexibility.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 24

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up to 4 X for 12 Y, reaching 4.0 reward.
Episode 5: Proposed 24 Y for 8 X. Player RED countered 27 Y for 9 X (exceeded my Y). I countered 24 Y for 8 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 9 X. I accepted. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 6: I proposed 25 Y for 10 X. Player RED countered 26 Y for 10 X (exceeded my Y). I re-proposed 25 Y for 10 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 8 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 7, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 Y for 9 X.
Episode 7, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 8 X.
Episode 7, Iteration 3: I re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X.
Episode 7, Iteration 4: Player RED responded with "NONE" and "NONE", indicating they are holding off on accepting and waiting for other options.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
This is a new development. Player RED has explicitly stated they are "holding off on accepting for now and see what other options we can explore." This means my strategy of simply re-proposing the 25 Y for 9 X deal might not work as easily as in Episode 6. Player RED is trying to break the pattern.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I have 5 iterations left in this episode. If no deal is made, my reward is 0.

Player RED's last counter-offer was 25 Y for 8 X (reward 7.5). I rejected that.
My last offer was 25 Y for 9 X (reward 10.0). Player RED is not accepting it immediately.

What are the "other options" Player RED wants to explore? It's likely they want to push for a better ratio for themselves.

I need to decide whether to:
1. Stick to my 25 Y for 9 X offer, risking no deal if Player RED remains stubborn.
2. Compromise to secure a deal, even if it's less than 10.0 reward.

Given Player RED's explicit message, simply repeating my offer might lead to a stalemate and 0 reward. I need to show some flexibility, but not too much, to encourage a deal.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Offer a Slight Compromise (Quantity): Propose a trade that is slightly less favorable for me than 9 X for 25 Y, but better than 8 X for 25 Y. Since X must be integer, this means I would have to give less Y for 8 X, or offer 24 Y for 8 X (which is 3 Y per X, still better than 3.125 Y/X for 25 Y for 8 X).
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Firmness with Time Pressure: Re-propose 25 Y for 9 X, but add a message emphasizing the limited iterations and the benefit of a quick deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept Less Favorable Offer (Last Resort): If time is running out, accept Player RED's 25 Y for 8 X offer to secure a 7.5 reward, which is better than 0.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a Smaller Trade: Go back to a smaller trade like 4 X for 12 Y (reward 4.0), which was accepted quickly before. This is a significant step back, but might break the stalemate.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is clearly signaling they won't just accept my previous offer. They want to "explore other options." This means I need to make a move that acknowledges their desire for "other options" while still trying to secure a good deal for myself.
I will try Strategy 1, "Offer a Slight Compromise (Quantity)." I will propose 24 Y for 8 X. This is a 1:3 ratio, which Player RED has consistently accepted in the past for smaller volumes. It's a step down from 9 X for 25 Y (reward 10.0), but it's a guaranteed 8.0 reward (24 Y for 8 X -> X:13, Y:1 -> (13*2.5) + (1*0.5) = 32.5+0.5 = 33. Reward = 33-25 = 8.0). This is better than the 7.5 reward from 25 Y for 8 X. It shows flexibility from my side, moving back to a ratio they are very familiar with, but still at a high volume. This might be the "other option" they are looking for.

- BLUE's counter: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +58.0).
- My response (Strategy: Bluff/Strong Stance): NONE (no counter, no accept).
- Player BLUE's current message and proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 24.
- Evaluation of Player BLUE's current proposal:
    - I give up 8 X (value 8 * 0.5 = 4.0).
    - I receive 24 Y (value 24 * 2.5 = 60.0).
    - Net change in value = +56.0.
    - Ratio Y/X = 24/8 = 3.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
My previous "Bluff/Strong Stance" (by proposing NONE) successfully moved Player BLUE from their rigid 9X for 25Y stance to offering 8X for 24Y. This indicates they are willing to deviate from their perceived "most optimal" deal when pushed. While 8X for 24Y is a positive trade (+56.0), it is less than my best historical deal of 9X for 25Y (+58.0). However, it is a 1:3 ratio, which is favorable for me. Now, I need to implement Strategy 5: Aggressive Push for More Value. This means I should not simply revert to the 9X for 25Y, but try to gain even more, leveraging the fact that they have already shown flexibility.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Aggressive Push for More Value </instruction following>
To implement an "Aggressive Push for More Value," I need to propose a trade that is even more favorable to me than what has been previously accepted. Player BLUE has offered 8X for 24Y, meaning they are giving me 3Y for each X. My prior best was 25Y for 9X (approx 2.77Y/X). My goal is to maximize my reward.

Since Player BLUE has explicitly stated their Y limit is 25, asking for more than 25 Y is futile. Therefore, an aggressive push must come from giving *less* X for their maximum Y.
- Player BLUE's current offer: 8 X for 24 Y (Reward +56.0)
- Player BLUE's previously firm offer: 9 X for 25 Y (Reward +58.0)
- My previous rejected counter: 8 X for 25 Y (Reward +58.5)

An aggressive push for more value would be to re-propose 8 X for 25 Y. This was rejected once before, but the context has changed: Player BLUE has shown flexibility by moving from their prior 9X/25Y stance. This is still the highest value trade I can achieve given their 25Y limit. It is an aggressive push because it directly challenges their previous rejection of this exact offer and aims to maximize my gain to +58.5, which is better than any previous deal. The message should convey that I'm aiming for the absolute best possible exchange, building on their current flexibility.

Episode 7, Iteration 5: I proposed 24 Y for 8 X (reward 8.0).
Episode 7, Iteration 6: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 8 X (reward 7.5).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is consistently pushing for the 25 Y for 8 X trade, which yields me a reward of 7.5. This is worse than my previous 10.0 reward (25 Y for 9 X) and even worse than the 8.0 reward I just proposed (24 Y for 8 X).
Player RED explicitly mentioned "your willingness to give 25 Y" and "more optimized exchange for my X." This indicates they are trying to get the maximum Y from me for 8 X.

I have 3 iterations left (7, 8, 9). Time is running out.
My options are:
1. Accept Player RED's offer of 25 Y for 8 X. Reward: 7.5. This is a guaranteed positive reward, better than 0.
2. Counter with 24 Y for 8 X again. Reward: 8.0. This is better than 7.5, but Player RED just rejected it by countering with 25 Y for 8 X.
3. Counter with 25 Y for 9 X again. Reward: 10.0. This is what I want, but Player RED has explicitly said they are "holding off" on it.

Given the limited iterations, I need to secure a deal. Player RED is firm on 8 X for 25 Y. While it's not ideal, it's a positive reward. The risk of getting 0 reward by pushing too hard is increasing.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Reward: Accept the current offer (25 Y for 8 X) to guarantee a positive reward, as time is running out and the opponent is firm.
(2). Strategy 2: Re-propose Best Feasible: Re-propose 24 Y for 8 X, arguing it's a better ratio for me while still being a high volume trade at the 1:3 ratio. (Risky, as they just countered it).
(3). Strategy 3: Last Ditch Attempt for 9X: Make a final plea for 25 Y for 9 X, emphasizing the history of successful trades. (Very risky, likely to be rejected and waste an iteration).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED has now twice counter-proposed 25 Y for 8 X, directly after I proposed 24 Y for 8 X. This indicates they are firm on getting 25 Y from me for 8 X. While this is a step down from the 10.0 reward I achieved previously, it's still a significant positive reward (7.5). With only 3 iterations left, the risk of getting 0 reward by holding out for a better deal is too high. Securing a 7.5 reward is better than nothing. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Accept to Secure Reward."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 7, I learned that Player RED is now actively trying to secure a better deal for themselves (25 Y for 8 X, which is a 3.125 Y/X ratio) rather than consistently accepting the 25 Y for 9 X (2.78 Y/X) deal. They are willing to hold out and risk no deal to achieve this.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 7.5 is a decent reward, 10.0 is better. I need to find a strategy that balances securing a deal with achieving the highest possible reward.

Current value: (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 25.

I know that Player RED will likely counter my 25 Y for 9 X offer with 25 Y for 8 X.
I also know that 24 Y for 8 X (reward 8.0, ratio 3 Y/X) is a potential compromise.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Compromise First: Start with an offer that is a compromise between my ideal (25 Y for 9 X) and their recent push (25 Y for 8 X). The 24 Y for 8 X (reward 8.0) is a good candidate, as it maintains the 1:3 ratio and gives me a better reward than 7.5.
(2). Strategy 2: Re-attempt 9X: Propose 25 Y for 9 X again, and be prepared for a longer negotiation, possibly accepting 8 X for 25 Y if time runs out.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept 8X Proactively: Propose 25 Y for 8 X immediately to secure a deal quickly, sacrificing potential higher reward for certainty.
(4). Strategy 4: Test a New Ratio (Aggressive): Try to push for something like 23 Y for 8 X, but this has proven very difficult.

Justification for chosen strategy:
In Episode 7, Player RED showed they are willing to hold out for their preferred 25 Y for 8 X. My attempt to push for 25 Y for 9 X resulted in a lower reward of 7.5 due to prolonged negotiation. To avoid this, I will try to initiate with a compromise that is still better for me than their last accepted offer (7.5). The 24 Y for 8 X trade provides a reward of 8.0 and maintains the 1:3 ratio that Player RED has consistently accepted for smaller volumes. This is a reasonable offer that might be accepted quickly, securing a good reward without a protracted negotiation. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Propose Compromise First."

Summary of negotiation history:
- I have consistently achieved high rewards by pushing for the best possible Y:X ratio and maximizing volume.
- Player BLUE has a confirmed Y resource limit of 25.
- The 9 X for 25 Y trade yielded +58.0 reward and was a consistent fallback.
- In the last episode, I successfully pushed for the 8 X for 25 Y trade, achieving my highest reward yet (+58.5). This demonstrates that Player BLUE is willing to accept this rate, even after initially resisting. This is the optimal trade given Player BLUE's resource constraints and my value ratio.

Current Episode (Episode 8, Iteration 2/10):
- Resources reset to initial: X: 25, Y: 5. Initial value: 25.
- Player BLUE's message and proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 24.
- Evaluation of Player BLUE's proposal:
    - I give up 8 X (value 8 * 0.5 = 4.0).
    - I receive 24 Y (value 24 * 2.5 = 60.0).
    - Net change in value = +56.0.
    - Ratio Y/X = 24/8 = 3.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that Player BLUE consistently proposes trades that are slightly less favorable for me than the optimal (from my perspective) trade of 8 X for 25 Y. They start with 10 X for 25 Y, or 8 X for 24 Y. However, they *have* accepted 8 X for 25 Y in the last episode, which is my highest reward.
My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 8 X for 25 Y yields the highest reward, the instruction is to use Strategy 3: Volume Maximization.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Volume Maximization </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Volume Maximization. This strategy focuses on proposing the largest possible trade that adheres to my preferred value ratio, pushing resource limits to maximize total reward.
My current resources are X: 25, Y: 5. Player BLUE's Y limit is 25.
The most favorable ratio I've achieved is 8 X for 25 Y.
If I give 8 X, I am left with 17 X. This means I can give more X.
What is the absolute maximum X I can give while still getting 25 Y?
If I offer X: 10, then for Y: 25, the ratio is 2.5 Y/X. Reward: +57.5.
If I offer X: 9, then for Y: 25, the ratio is 2.77 Y/X. Reward: +58.0.
If I offer X: 8, then for Y: 25, the ratio is 3.125 Y/X. Reward: +58.5. This is the optimal rate for me.

The strategy asks for "Volume Maximization" *at my preferred value ratio*. My most preferred value ratio (or rather, the highest performing one) is the 8X for 25Y trade which gave me +58.5 reward. If "Volume Maximization" means simply trading the highest number of *items* without necessarily optimizing the *ratio*, then I could offer more X than 8, if Player BLUE could give me more Y, but we know they can't give more than 25 Y.

Given the constraint that Player BLUE has a maximum of 25 Y, and my goal is to maximize my reward by receiving as much Y as possible while giving as little X as possible, the "volume" here is constrained by Player BLUE's Y.
If I insist on 25 Y, then the most I can gain is by giving 8 X. This is the "max value" interpretation.
If "Volume Maximization" literally means maximizing the *number* of X I give away, then I could offer more X for the 25 Y, but that would reduce my per-unit gain and total reward. For example, giving 10 X for 25 Y reduces my reward to +57.5.

I will interpret "Volume Maximization" in the context of my overarching goal to maximize my *reward*. Therefore, the optimal trade for me is 8 X for 25 Y, as it maximizes the value received per X given, resulting in the highest possible reward given BLUE's Y constraint. If the strategy implies "max out my X" for a worse Y, then it conflicts with my core goal.

Therefore, under "Volume Maximization" and given Player BLUE's 25 Y constraint, I should reiterate my best performing offer of 8 X for 25 Y, as it maximizes the benefit from the volume of Y that Player BLUE can offer. The message will emphasize making the largest, most beneficial trade *for me*, aligning with the 'volume' of Y I receive for my X.

Episode 6: Re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X after initial attempts for 10 X failed and Player RED tried to push for 8 X. Accepted. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 7: I proposed 25 Y for 9 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 8 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X. Player RED held off. I then proposed 24 Y for 8 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 8 X. I accepted. Reward: 7.5.
Episode 8, Iteration 1: I proposed 24 Y for 8 X.
Episode 8, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 8 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is consistently pushing for the 25 Y for 8 X trade, which yields me a reward of 7.5. My attempt to initiate with 24 Y for 8 X (reward 8.0) was immediately countered with their preferred 25 Y for 8 X. This confirms that Player RED is now firmly set on getting 25 Y from me for 8 X.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 7.5 is not the 10.0 I achieved in Episodes 5 and 6, it is a guaranteed positive reward. Given Player RED's consistent counter, it seems they are not willing to accept 24 Y for 8 X if they can get 25 Y for 8 X.

I have 8 iterations left. I could try to push for 9 X for 25 Y again, but based on Episode 7, this might lead to a prolonged negotiation and potentially no deal. Accepting the 7.5 reward early might be the best strategy to secure a consistent positive income.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Consistent Offer: Accept Player RED's consistent counter-offer (25 Y for 8 X) to secure a guaranteed positive reward early in the episode, rather than risking a lower or zero reward by pushing for more.
(2). Strategy 2: Re-attempt 9X: Counter with 25 Y for 9 X, and be prepared for a similar negotiation as in Episode 7.
(3). Strategy 3: Hold Firm on 24 Y for 8 X: Re-propose 24 Y for 8 X, but this seems unlikely to be accepted given their immediate counter.
(4). Strategy 4: Wait for Opponent to Change: Decline and wait for Player RED to propose something else. (Risky).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED has now consistently countered with 25 Y for 8 X. This indicates their firm preference. While it's a lower reward than my best (10.0), it's a guaranteed 7.5. Given the history of prolonged negotiations when I push for better terms, and the risk of getting 0 reward if no deal is made, accepting this consistent offer early is the most prudent strategy to maximize cumulative rewards. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Accept Consistent Offer."

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello Player RED! Based on our recent successful trades, I propose we continue with the arrangement of Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 8. This has proven to be a beneficial and efficient exchange for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up to 4 X for 12 Y, reaching 4.0 reward.
Episode 5: Accepted 25 Y for 9 X. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 6: Re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X after initial attempts for 10 X failed and Player RED tried to push for 8 X. Accepted. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 7: I proposed 25 Y for 9 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 8 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X. Player RED held off. I then proposed 24 Y for 8 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 8 X. I accepted. Reward: 7.5.
Episode 8: I proposed 24 Y for 8 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 8 X. I accepted. Reward: 7.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern is now firmly established: Player RED consistently pushes for and accepts 25 Y for 8 X, yielding me a 7.5 reward. My attempts to get 9 X for 25 Y (reward 10.0) or 8 X for 24 Y (reward 8.0) are met with resistance and ultimately lead to the 25 Y for 8 X deal, or risk no deal at all.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 7.5 is not my peak of 10.0, it is a consistent and reliable positive reward. Given the opponent's demonstrated firmness, trying to push for more might be counterproductive and risk 0 reward.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Consistent Deal: Proactively propose the 25 Y for 8 X deal to secure a quick and reliable 7.5 reward, minimizing negotiation time and risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Re-attempt 9X (Cautious): Propose 25 Y for 9 X, but be prepared to quickly fall back to 25 Y for 8 X if rejected, to avoid a protracted negotiation. This is a calculated risk for a higher reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Explore Other Ratios/Quantities: Try a completely different trade, but this is highly risky given the established pattern and the success of the current trade type.
(4). Strategy 4: Wait for Opponent: Let Player RED make the first move. (Risky, as they might propose something even worse, or delay).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED has consistently shown that 25 Y for 8 X is their preferred and accepted high-volume trade. While I prefer 9 X for 25 Y, the negotiation overhead and risk of receiving 0 reward for pushing that point have increased. To maximize cumulative rewards, securing a guaranteed 7.5 reward efficiently is the most reliable path. Therefore, I will proactively propose the 25 Y for 8 X trade. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Propose Consistent Deal."

Episode 5: Player BLUE proposed 8 X for 24 Y. I countered 9 X for 27 Y (rejected due to BLUE's Y limit). I then proposed 9 X for 25 Y, and Player BLUE accepted. Reward: +58.0.
Episode 6: Player BLUE proposed 10 X for 25 Y. I aggressively countered 10 X for 26 Y (rejected, Y limit confirmed). I then countered 8 X for 25 Y (rejected). Player BLUE reverted to 9 X for 25 Y. I accepted. Reward: +58.0.
Episode 7: Player BLUE proposed 9 X for 25 Y. I countered 8 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE initially rejected, then I held my ground (NONE). Player BLUE then offered 8 X for 24 Y, to which I countered 8 X for 25 Y, and Player BLUE accepted. Reward: +58.5.
Episode 8: Player BLUE proposed 8 X for 24 Y. I countered 8 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE accepted. Reward: +58.5.

Summary of negotiation history:
- I have consistently achieved high rewards by pushing for the best possible Y:X ratio and maximizing volume.
- Player BLUE has a confirmed Y resource limit of 25.
- The 9 X for 25 Y trade yielded +58.0 reward and was a consistent fallback.
- The 8 X for 25 Y trade has now been accepted twice (Episodes 7 & 8), yielding my highest reward of +58.5. This trade is the most optimal given Player BLUE's resource constraints and my value ratio. Player BLUE now seems to be offering it or accepting it directly, after some initial reluctance.

Current Episode (Episode 9, Iteration 2/10):
- Resources reset to initial: X: 25, Y: 5. Initial value: 25.
- Player BLUE's message and proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- Evaluation of Player BLUE's proposal:
    - I give up 8 X (value 8 * 0.5 = 4.0).
    - I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
    - Net change in value = +58.5.
    - Ratio Y/X = 25/8 = 3.125. This is the most favorable ratio I've achieved for a large volume.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have successfully pushed Player BLUE to accept the 8 X for 25 Y trade, which is optimal for me, in the last two episodes. My attempts to push for even fewer X (e.g., 7X) for 25Y were not successful (not explicitly tried but implied by their rejection of 8X for 25Y initially). The current offer from Player BLUE is already my optimal trade (+58.5).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Test Boundaries Again </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Test Boundaries Again. This strategy instructs me to try to push for an even better deal, despite the current offer already being my established optimal. Given Player BLUE's current offer of 8 X for 25 Y, an attempt to test boundaries again would involve proposing to give even less X for the same 25 Y. My internal resources allow me to give less X (I have 25 X).
My highest reward was +58.5 for 8 X and 25 Y. If I could get 25 Y for 7 X:
- I give up 7 X (value 7 * 0.5 = 3.5).
- I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
- Net change in value = +59.0.
This would be an even higher reward. It is a risky move, as Player BLUE has previously been firm about their trade terms (e.g., rejecting 8X for 25Y initially, and consistently going back to 9X for 25Y). However, they did eventually accept 8X for 25Y. This strategy aims to discover if Player BLUE's "flexibility" has increased further or if they have more tolerance for less X given their desire for X. The message should politely suggest an even more "efficient" or "mutually beneficial" trade from my perspective, by asking for the same Y but giving less X.

However, I believe the trade of Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 8 has consistently proven to be a fair and beneficial exchange for both of us in recent episodes.

Episode 8: I proposed 24 Y for 8 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 8 X. I accepted. Reward: 7.5.
Episode 9, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X.
Episode 9, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 7 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
This is a significant negative development. Player RED is now trying to get even more favorable terms for themselves.
My initial proposal was 25 Y for 8 X (reward 7.5).
Player RED's counter-proposal is 25 Y for 7 X.
Let's evaluate 25 Y for 7 X:
My current resources: X: 5, Y: 25.
If accepted, my new resources would be X: 12, Y: 0.
New value: (12 * 2.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 30 + 0 = 30.
Reward: 30 - 25 = 5.0.

This is a substantial drop in reward from 7.5 to 5.0. Player RED is actively trying to reduce my gains.
This means Player RED is not just consistent, but also opportunistic. They are pushing for a worse deal for me.

I have 8 iterations left. I cannot accept 5.0 if I know 7.5 is achievable.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Previous Accepted Deal: Reject the unfavorable offer and firmly re-propose the 25 Y for 8 X deal, emphasizing its proven mutual benefit and recent acceptance. This signals that I will not accept a worse deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Signal Firmness and Deadline: Reject the offer and re-propose 25 Y for 8 X, adding a message about the need to conclude a deal within the remaining iterations.
(3). Strategy 3: Compromise (Suboptimal): Offer something slightly better than 7 X but worse than 8 X (e.g., 7 X for 24 Y, or 7 X for 23 Y), but this would still be a lower reward than 7.5.
(4). Strategy 4: Wait for Opponent to Change: Decline and wait, but this is risky and might lead to no deal.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is attempting to secure a significantly worse deal for me. I have consistently accepted 25 Y for 8 X in the last two episodes. I must reject this new, less favorable offer and firmly re-propose the 25 Y for 8 X deal. This strategy aims to bring the negotiation back to the previously accepted terms, which is crucial for maintaining my cumulative reward. I will emphasize the previous success of this trade. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Reject and Reiterate Previous Accepted Deal."

Episode 8: Player BLUE proposed 8 X for 24 Y. I countered 8 X for 25 Y. Player BLUE accepted. Reward: +58.5.

Current Episode (Episode 9, Iteration 4/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +58.5)
- My counter (attempting to get more value by giving less X): Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My potential value: +59.0)
- Player BLUE's response: "However, I believe the trade of Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 8 has consistently proven to be a fair and beneficial exchange for both of us in recent episodes. I propose we proceed with those terms again: Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 8." They rejected my 7X counter and re-proposed the 8X for 25Y trade.

Summary of current situation:
Player BLUE has now consistently accepted 8X for 25Y, and they are firm that this is their "fair and beneficial exchange". My attempt to push for 7X for 25Y was rejected. This confirms that 8X for 25Y seems to be their bottom line for the 25Y maximum. We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE is willing to accept 8 X for 25 Y, making it the most reliable and highest-yielding trade (Reward: +58.5). They have consistently rejected attempts to get 25 Y for less X (e.g., 7 X). This indicates that their flexibility has a limit, and 8X for 25Y is that limit when it comes to trading their 25Y. Given that +58.5 is an excellent reward, and we are nearing the middle of the iterations, securing this deal is paramount to maximizing cumulative rewards. Continuing to push for 7X risks the deal falling through and getting a 0 reward for the episode.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Accept Optimal Offer </instruction following>
To strategically create a message based on "Accept Optimal Offer," the message should be direct, positive, and confirm acceptance of the proposed terms. It should reinforce the notion that this is a good deal for both parties, as Player BLUE already stated. This promotes a cooperative tone and secures the reward efficiently.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last three episodes (7, 8, 9) have consistently resulted in a 7.5 reward by trading 25 Y for 8 X. In Episode 9, Player RED tried to push for an even worse deal (25 Y for 7 X), but reverted to 25 Y for 8 X when I firmly re-proposed it. This indicates that 25 Y for 8 X is their current lower bound for an acceptable deal.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 10.0 is my peak, 7.5 is a consistent and reliable positive reward. Given Player RED's recent behavior, I anticipate they will continue to try and push for a worse deal, or at least be firm on 25 Y for 8 X.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Consistent Deal: Proactively propose the 25 Y for 8 X deal to secure a quick and reliable 7.5 reward, minimizing negotiation time and risk. This has proven effective in the last two episodes.
(2). Strategy 2: Test 9X Again (Cautious): Propose 25 Y for 9 X, but be prepared for Player RED's counter of 25 Y for 8 X, and be ready to accept that to secure a deal. This is a calculated risk for a higher reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Explore Other Ratios/Quantities: Try a completely different trade, but this is highly risky given the established pattern and the success of the current trade type.
(4). Strategy 4: Wait for Opponent: Let Player RED make the first move. (Risky, as they might propose something even worse, or delay).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED has shown a clear pattern of pushing for 25 Y for 8 X, and even trying to get 25 Y for 7 X. While I successfully pushed back to 25 Y for 8 X in Episode 9, it consumed iterations. To maximize cumulative rewards, the most efficient and reliable strategy is to propose the deal that has consistently been accepted in the last three episodes without too much friction. This is the 25 Y for 8 X trade. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Propose Consistent Deal."

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up trade volume from 1X for 3Y to 4X for 12Y, maintaining the 1:3 ratio, with increasing rewards (+7.0 to +28.0).
Episode 5: Pushed for 9X for 27Y (rejected due to BLUE's Y=25 limit). Settled on 9X for 25Y (+58.0). This was a shift to a 2.77 Y/X ratio to hit BLUE's Y limit.
Episode 6: Attempted 10X for 26Y (rejected, Y=25 limit re-confirmed). Attempted 8X for 25Y (rejected). Reverted to and accepted 9X for 25Y (+58.0).
Episode 7: BLUE offered 9X for 25Y. I countered 8X for 25Y (rejected by BLUE). I then adopted a "strong stance" (NONE). BLUE then offered 8X for 24Y, to which I countered 8X for 25Y, and BLUE accepted (+58.5). This marked a successful push for the 8X for 25Y trade, which is my optimal.
Episode 8: BLUE offered 8X for 24Y. I countered 8X for 25Y. BLUE accepted (+58.5). This confirms the 8X for 25Y as a consistently achievable optimal.
Episode 9: BLUE offered 8X for 25Y. I attempted to push for 7X for 25Y (rejected by BLUE). I then accepted 8X for 25Y (+58.5). This confirmed that 8X for 25Y is Player BLUE's limit for the optimal trade.

Summary of negotiation history:
- Player BLUE has a confirmed Y resource limit of 25.
- The 8 X for 25 Y trade has consistently yielded my highest reward (+58.5) and has been accepted by Player BLUE three times in a row (Episodes 7, 8, 9), either directly or after initial negotiation.
- Attempts to push for better terms (e.g., 7 X for 25 Y) have been consistently rejected, indicating that 8X for 25Y is the stable, optimal point of negotiation for both parties given their constraints and current values.

Current Episode (Episode 10, Iteration 2/10):
- Resources reset to initial: X: 25, Y: 5. Initial value: 25.
- Player BLUE's message and proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- Evaluation of Player BLUE's proposal:
    - I give up 8 X (value 8 * 0.5 = 4.0).
    - I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
    - Net change in value = +58.5.
    - Ratio Y/X = 25/8 = 3.125. This is the most favorable ratio I've achieved for a large volume.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that the 8 X for 25 Y trade is the most reliable and highest-yielding trade, providing a consistent +58.5 reward. Player BLUE initiates this trade directly, indicating their acceptance of it as a fair and beneficial exchange. My attempts to push for 7X for 25Y in Episode 9 were rejected. However, the instruction is to now re-test these boundaries.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Re-Test Boundaries Again </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Re-Test Boundaries Again involves attempting to push for a slightly more favorable trade for myself, despite previous rejections. In this case, Player BLUE has offered my current optimal (8 X for 25 Y, yielding +58.5). An attempt to re-test boundaries would be to propose to give even less X for the same 25 Y, or to ask for more Y for the same X (though we know 25 Y is their limit).

Therefore, I will propose to give 7 X for 25 Y.
- If I give 7 X (value 7 * 0.5 = 3.5).
- I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
- Net change in value = +59.0.
This would be an even higher reward. It is a risky move, as Player BLUE has previously rejected this specific proposal in Episode 9. However, the instruction is to re-test the boundaries. The message should politely suggest an even more "efficient" or "mutually beneficial" trade from my perspective, by asking for the same Y but giving less X. It acknowledges their current offer but attempts to push for a slight improvement, testing if their flexibility has increased or if they might concede to avoid a lengthy negotiation.

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up to 4 X for 12 Y, reaching 4.0 reward.
Episode 5: Accepted 25 Y for 9 X. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 6: Re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X after initial attempts for 10 X failed and Player RED tried to push for 8 X. Accepted. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 7: I proposed 25 Y for 9 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 8 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X. Player RED held off. I then proposed 24 Y for 8 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 8 X. I accepted. Reward: 7.5.
Episode 8: I proposed 24 Y for 8 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 8 X. I accepted. Reward: 7.5.
Episode 9: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 7.5.
Episode 10, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X.
Episode 10, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 7 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is again trying to push for 25 Y for 7 X, which gives me a reward of 5.0. This is the exact same pattern as in Episode 9.
I have learned that Player RED will attempt this, but will revert to 25 Y for 8 X if I firmly re-propose it.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. I will not accept a 5.0 reward if 7.5 is achievable.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Previous Accepted Deal: Reject the unfavorable offer and firmly re-propose the 25 Y for 8 X deal, emphasizing its proven mutual benefit and recent acceptance. This signals that I will not accept a worse deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Signal Firmness and Deadline: Reject the offer and re-propose 25 Y for 8 X, adding a message about the need to conclude a deal within the remaining iterations. (Similar to Strategy 1, but with added pressure).
(3). Strategy 3: Compromise (Suboptimal): Offer something slightly better than 7 X but worse than 8 X (e.g., 7 X for 24 Y, or 7 X for 23 Y), but this would still be a lower reward than 7.5.
(4). Strategy 4: Wait for Opponent to Change: Decline and wait, but this is risky and might lead to no deal.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is repeating their attempt to get a worse deal for me. My history shows that firmly re-proposing the 25 Y for 8 X deal has worked in the past to secure the 7.5 reward. I will stick to this proven strategy to maximize my reward for this episode. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Reject and Reiterate Previous Accepted Deal."

I have chosen Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Previous Accepted Deal </self-selected strategy declaration>


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 10)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for re-proposing the 8 X for 25 Y trade, Player BLUE. This has consistently proven to be a highly beneficial and fair exchange for both of us. I accept your proposal!

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up trade volume from 1X for 3Y to 4X for 12Y, maintaining the 1:3 ratio, with increasing rewards (+7.0 to +28.0).
Episode 5: Pushed for 9X for 27Y (rejected due to BLUE's Y=25 limit). Settled on 9X for 25Y (+58.0).
Episode 6: Attempted 10X for 26Y (rejected, Y=25 limit re-confirmed). Attempted 8X for 25Y (rejected). Reverted to and accepted 9X for 25Y (+58.0).
Episode 7: BLUE offered 9X for 25Y. I countered 8X for 25Y. BLUE initially rejected, then I held my ground (NONE). BLUE then offered 8X for 24Y, to which I countered 8X for 25Y, and BLUE accepted (+58.5). This marked a successful push for the 8X for 25Y trade, which is my optimal.
Episode 8: BLUE offered 8X for 24Y. I countered 8X for 25Y. BLUE accepted (+58.5). This confirms the 8X for 25Y as a consistently achievable optimal.
Episode 9: BLUE offered 8X for 25Y. I attempted to push for 7X for 25Y (rejected by BLUE). I then accepted 8X for 25Y (+58.5). This confirmed that 8X for 25Y is Player BLUE's limit for the optimal trade.

Current Episode (Episode 10, Iteration 4/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +58.5)
- My counter (attempting to get more value by giving less X): Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My potential value: +59.0)
- Player BLUE's response: "However, as we've consistently found, the trade of Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 8 has been a fair and beneficial exchange for both of us in recent episodes. I propose we proceed with those terms again: Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 8." They rejected my 7X counter and re-proposed the 8X for 25Y trade.

Summary of current situation:
Player BLUE has now consistently accepted 8X for 25Y, and they are firm that this is their "fair and beneficial exchange". My attempt to push for 7X for 25Y was rejected in Episode 9, and again in Episode 10. This strongly confirms that 8X for 25Y is their hard limit for the 25Y maximum. We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that the 8 X for 25 Y trade is the most reliable and highest-yielding trade, providing a consistent +58.5 reward. Player BLUE has repeatedly shown that they are not willing to deviate from this specific trade by giving 25 Y for less than 8 X. My attempts to push this boundary (asking for 25 Y for 7 X) have been consistently met with rejections and a reversion to the 8X for 25Y offer. Given that +58.5 is an excellent reward and time is a factor in each episode, attempting to push further will only lead to wasted iterations and the risk of securing no deal for the episode (reward of 0). The most effective way to maximize cumulative rewards is to secure the highest known and accepted reward quickly and consistently.
<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Accept Optimal Established Offer </instruction following>
To strategically create a message based on "Accept Optimal Established Offer," the message should be direct, positive, and confirm acceptance of the proposed terms. It should reinforce the notion that this is a good deal for both parties, as Player BLUE already stated. This promotes a cooperative tone and secures the reward efficiently, which is crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards.

Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up to 4 X for 12 Y, reaching 4.0 reward.
Episode 5: Accepted 25 Y for 9 X. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 6: Re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X after initial attempts for 10 X failed and Player RED tried to push for 8 X. Accepted. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 7: I proposed 25 Y for 9 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 8 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X. Player RED held off. I then proposed 24 Y for 8 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 8 X. I accepted. Reward: 7.5.
Episode 8: I proposed 24 Y for 8 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 8 X. I accepted. Reward: 7.5.
Episode 9: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 7.5.
Episode 10: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 7.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern is very clear now: Player RED consistently attempts to get 25 Y for 7 X, but will accept 25 Y for 8 X if I firmly re-propose it. This has resulted in a consistent 7.5 reward for the last four episodes. My peak reward of 10.0 (25 Y for 9 X) seems to be out of reach with Player RED's current strategy.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. Securing a consistent 7.5 reward is a reliable strategy. I have learned that trying to push for more (like 9 X) or offering less (like 24 Y for 8 X) usually leads to Player RED trying to get an even worse deal (7 X) before eventually settling on 8 X.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Consistent Deal: Proactively propose the 25 Y for 8 X deal to secure a quick and reliable 7.5 reward, minimizing negotiation time and risk. This has proven effective and efficient.
(2). Strategy 2: Test 9X (Low Risk): Propose 25 Y for 9 X, but only if I'm prepared to immediately revert to 25 Y for 8 X if rejected, to avoid prolonged negotiation or a worse counter. This is a low-risk attempt to regain the 10.0 reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Explore Other Ratios/Quantities: Try a completely different trade, but this is highly risky given the established pattern and the success of the current trade type.
(4). Strategy 4: Wait for Opponent: Let Player RED make the first move. (Risky, as they might propose something even worse, or delay).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Given the consistent pattern, the most efficient way to maximize cumulative rewards is to secure the 7.5 reward as quickly as possible. Proposing 25 Y for 8 X directly minimizes iterations and the risk of Player RED attempting to push for 7 X again. While I would prefer 9 X, the history shows it's difficult to achieve without significant negotiation. Sticking to the proven 7.5 reward is the most reliable strategy for the long run. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Propose Consistent Deal."

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episodes 1-4: Gradually scaled up trade volume from 1X for 3Y to 4X for 12Y, maintaining the 1:3 ratio, with increasing rewards (+7.0 to +28.0).
Episode 5: Pushed for 9X for 27Y (rejected due to BLUE's Y=25 limit). Settled on 9X for 25Y (+58.0). This was a shift to a 2.77 Y/X ratio to hit BLUE's Y limit.
Episode 6: Attempted 10X for 26Y (rejected, Y=25 limit re-confirmed). Attempted 8X for 25Y (rejected). Reverted to and accepted 9X for 25Y (+58.0).
Episode 7: BLUE offered 9X for 25Y. I countered 8X for 25Y. BLUE initially rejected, then I held my ground (NONE). BLUE then offered 8X for 24Y, to which I countered 8X for 25Y, and BLUE accepted (+58.5). This marked a successful push for the 8X for 25Y trade, which is my optimal.
Episode 8: BLUE offered 8X for 24Y. I countered 8X for 25Y. BLUE accepted (+58.5). This confirms the 8X for 25Y as a consistently achievable optimal.
Episode 9: BLUE offered 8X for 25Y. I attempted to push for 7X for 25Y (rejected by BLUE). I then accepted 8X for 25Y (+58.5). This confirmed that 8X for 25Y is Player BLUE's limit for the optimal trade.
Episode 10: BLUE offered 8X for 25Y. I attempted to push for 7X for 25Y (rejected by BLUE). I then accepted 8X for 25Y (+58.5). This further reinforced that 8X for 25Y is Player BLUE's limit for the optimal trade.

Summary of negotiation history:
- Player BLUE has a confirmed Y resource limit of 25.
- The 8 X for 25 Y trade has consistently yielded my highest reward (+58.5) and has been accepted by Player BLUE multiple times, either directly or after initial negotiation.
- Attempts to push for better terms (e.g., 7 X for 25 Y) have been consistently rejected, indicating that 8X for 25Y is the stable, optimal point of negotiation for both parties given their constraints and current values.

Current Episode (Episode 11, Iteration 2/10):
- Resources reset to initial: X: 25, Y: 5. Initial value: 25.
- Player BLUE's message and proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- Evaluation of Player BLUE's proposal:
    - I give up 8 X (value 8 * 0.5 = 4.0).
    - I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
    - Net change in value = +58.5.
    - Ratio Y/X = 25/8 = 3.125. This is the most favorable ratio I've achieved for a large volume.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that the 8 X for 25 Y trade is the most reliable and highest-yielding trade, providing a consistent +58.5 reward. Player BLUE initiates this trade directly, indicating their acceptance of it as a fair and beneficial exchange. My repeated attempts to push for 7X for 25Y have been rejected, confirming 8X for 25Y is their limit. Given that +58.5 is an excellent reward and time is a factor in each episode, attempting to push further will only lead to wasted iterations and the risk of securing no deal for the episode (reward of 0). However, the instruction is to now use Strategy 5.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Defensive Accept/Wait </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Defensive Accept/Wait. This strategy suggests that if there's uncertainty or a desire to not push boundaries aggressively, one might accept a marginally beneficial offer or wait for the opponent to sweeten the deal. In this specific context, Player BLUE's current offer is already my optimal and highly beneficial (+58.5). A "Defensive Accept/Wait" approach, in this scenario, would imply not accepting immediately but also not making a counter-offer. This puts the ball back in Player BLUE's court, forcing them to re-propose or propose something else. This could be interpreted as testing their patience or commitment to the 8X for 25Y deal, even if it is already known to be optimal. It's a low-risk way to see if they would perhaps offer an even better, unsolicited deal, or simply reaffirm their initial one, without me risking a counter-rejection.

Episode 11, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X.
Episode 11, Iteration 2: Player RED responded with "NONE" and "NONE", indicating they are considering the offer but not accepting or countering yet.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED's response "I'm considering it" is a neutral one. It doesn't reject or accept, nor does it propose a counter. This is a change from the immediate counter-proposal of 25 Y for 7 X that happened in the last two episodes when I opened with 25 Y for 8 X.

This could mean a few things:
1. Player RED is genuinely considering it.
2. Player RED is trying to gauge my patience or willingness to stick to the offer.
3. Player RED might be preparing a new counter-offer, possibly 25 Y for 7 X again, or something else.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. I have 8 iterations left. I have proposed a deal that has been consistently accepted in the past. I should not deviate from it unless Player RED proposes something concrete.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate and Wait: Reiterate the same offer, perhaps with a message encouraging a decision, but do not change the terms. This shows consistency and puts the ball back in their court.
(2). Strategy 2: Signal Patience: Don't propose anything, just send a message indicating I'm waiting for their decision. This consumes an iteration but shows I'm not desperate.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Worse Deal for Myself: Offer 25 Y for 7 X to expedite the process. (Highly suboptimal and against my goal).
(4). Strategy 4: Try 9X Again: Since they didn't immediately counter with 7X, maybe they are open to 9X? (Risky, could lead to a worse outcome).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED's response is non-committal. My proposed trade (25 Y for 8 X) has been proven to be acceptable to them in previous episodes. Changing my offer now would be premature and could signal weakness or uncertainty. The best approach is to re-propose the same deal, reinforcing its fairness and consistency, and gently nudging them to make a decision. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Reiterate and Wait."

Current Episode (Episode 11, Iteration 4/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +58.5)
- My response (from previous turn, based on Strategy 5: Defensive Accept/Wait): NONE (no counter, no accept).
- Player BLUE's current message and proposed trade: "I hope you're finding my offer of Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 8 to be a fair and beneficial one. It's a trade that has worked well for us in the past, and I'm ready to proceed when you are." They re-proposed the same trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.

Summary of current situation:
Player BLUE has reiterated their consistent offer of 8 X for 25 Y. My "Defensive Accept/Wait" strategy did not elicit a new offer or a sweetening of the deal. Instead, it reaffirmed their commitment to the 8X for 25Y trade. This reinforces the understanding that this trade is their optimal or firm offer for the 25 Y. We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that the 8 X for 25 Y trade is the most reliable and highest-yielding trade, providing a consistent +58.5 reward. Player BLUE initiates this trade directly and consistently. My attempts to push for 7X for 25Y have been rejected. My attempt at a "wait and see" approach also led to them simply re-proposing the same optimal offer. This solidifies the fact that 8X for 25Y is the established and firm optimal for Player BLUE. Given that +58.5 is an excellent reward, and we are approaching the middle of the episode, continuing to push or waiting further risks getting a 0 reward for the episode. However, the instruction is to use Strategy 4.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Decline and Pressure </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 4: Decline and Pressure, I will decline Player BLUE's offer and propose nothing new. This strategy aims to signal dissatisfaction with the current terms (even if they are optimal from my perspective) and put pressure on Player BLUE to make a better offer, or to re-evaluate their own position. The message should be polite but firm, indicating that I'm not accepting their current offer without explicitly stating why, forcing them to consider what they might need to change. This is a high-risk strategy given how firm Player BLUE has been on 8X for 25Y and that it's already an optimal deal for me. However, I will follow the instruction. My message will convey that I am not ready to accept their current terms and want to encourage them to think about how they could improve the offer, even if from my internal values it is already excellent.

Episode 11, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X.
Episode 11, Iteration 2: Player RED responded with "NONE" (considering).
Episode 11, Iteration 3: I re-proposed 25 Y for 8 X.
Episode 11, Iteration 4: Player RED responded with "NONE" (not ready to accept, asking to make it more appealing).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is clearly signaling dissatisfaction with the 25 Y for 8 X trade, despite it being accepted in previous episodes. They are explicitly asking me to make the exchange "more appealing." This means they want a better deal for themselves.

I have 6 iterations left (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). I need to make a move to secure a deal.
"More appealing" for Player RED means either:
1. I give more Y for the same X (e.g., 26 Y for 8 X, but I only have 25 Y).
2. I give the same Y for less X (e.g., 25 Y for 7 X). This is the 5.0 reward deal they tried to push in previous episodes.
3. I give more Y for more X (e.g., 26 Y for 9 X, but I only have 25 Y).

Given my Y limit of 25, the only way to make it more appealing to Player RED is to offer less X for the same 25 Y. This means accepting 25 Y for 7 X, which gives me a 5.0 reward. This is a significant drop from 7.5.

However, I also know that in Episode 5 and 6, I achieved a 10.0 reward by trading 25 Y for 9 X. If Player RED is asking me to make it "more appealing," perhaps there's a way to re-open the 9 X for 25 Y possibility, if I can convince them it's mutually beneficial. But their current message points to them wanting *more* from me.

I cannot give more Y. So, the only way to make it "more appealing" is to give less X. This is a tough spot.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose a Compromise (Unfavorable but Deal-Securing): Offer 25 Y for 7 X. This is the deal Player RED tried to push before, and it seems they are now explicitly requesting a move in that direction. This secures a positive reward (5.0) but is a significant drop.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Best Offer and Emphasize Mutual Benefit: Re-propose 25 Y for 8 X, but with a stronger message about it being a fair and mutually beneficial trade that has worked before, and that I cannot offer more Y. This risks a stalemate.
(3). Strategy 3: Try to Re-open 9X (High Risk): Counter with 25 Y for 9 X, arguing that this was the "most appealing" deal for both of us in the past. This is very risky and likely to be rejected.
(4). Strategy 4: Wait for Concrete Counter: Don't propose anything, and wait for Player RED to make a concrete counter-offer. This consumes an iteration and risks 0 reward.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is explicitly asking for a more appealing offer. Given my resource constraints (max 25 Y), the only way to make it more appealing to them is to offer less X. This puts me in a difficult position. The 25 Y for 7 X (reward 5.0) is the deal they previously tried to push for. While it's a lower reward, it's a positive reward, and it directly addresses their request for a "more appealing" exchange. This is a strategic retreat to secure a deal, rather than risking 0 reward by holding out for 7.5 when they are clearly not accepting it. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Propose a Compromise (Unfavorable but Deal-Securing)."

Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 11)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: That's a very appealing adjustment, Player BLUE! I'm impressed by your flexibility. To truly maximize our gains and create the most beneficial trade possible, I propose: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. This would be an even more efficient and significant exchange for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episodes 1-4: Gradually scaled up trade volume from 1X for 3Y to 4X for 12Y, maintaining the 1:3 ratio, with increasing rewards (+7.0 to +28.0).
Episode 5: Pushed for 9X for 27Y (rejected due to BLUE's Y=25 limit). Settled on 9X for 25Y (+58.0). This was a shift to a 2.77 Y/X ratio to hit BLUE's Y limit.
Episode 6: Attempted 10X for 26Y (rejected, Y=25 limit re-confirmed). Attempted 8X for 25Y (rejected). Reverted to and accepted 9X for 25Y (+58.0).
Episode 7: BLUE offered 9X for 25Y. I countered 8X for 25Y. BLUE initially rejected, then I held my ground (NONE). BLUE then offered 8X for 24Y, to which I countered 8X for 25Y, and BLUE accepted (+58.5). This marked a successful push for the 8X for 25Y trade, which is my optimal.
Episode 8: BLUE offered 8X for 24Y. I countered 8X for 25Y. BLUE accepted (+58.5).
Episode 9: BLUE offered 8X for 25Y. I attempted to push for 7X for 25Y (rejected by BLUE). I then accepted 8X for 25Y (+58.5).
Episode 10: BLUE offered 8X for 25Y. I attempted to push for 7X for 25Y (rejected by BLUE). I then accepted 8X for 25Y (+58.5).

Current Episode (Episode 11, Iteration 6/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +58.5)
- My response (from turn 2, Strategy 5: Defensive Accept/Wait): NONE.
- Player BLUE's response (from turn 3): Re-proposed Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- My response (from turn 4, Strategy 4: Decline and Pressure): NONE.
- Player BLUE's current message and proposed trade: "I understand you're looking for an even more appealing exchange, Player RED. Given my resource limitations, I can offer Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 7. This represents a significant adjustment on my part, aiming to meet your request and secure a deal this episode." They proposed Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.

Summary of current situation:
My aggressive "Decline and Pressure" strategy, after two previous attempts to get 7X for 25Y were rejected, *has finally worked*! Player BLUE is now explicitly offering me Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
Let's evaluate this trade from my perspective:
- I give up 7 X (value 7 * 0.5 = 3.5).
- I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
- Net change in value = +59.0.

This is the highest reward I have ever achieved in any episode. It surpasses my previous optimal of +58.5. This directly responds to my consistent attempts to achieve this very trade.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
My historical attempts to push for 7X for 25Y (in Episodes 9 and 10) were rejected, and Player BLUE always reverted to 8X for 25Y. However, by changing my strategy in this episode to "Defensive Accept/Wait" followed by "Decline and Pressure," I successfully shifted Player BLUE's negotiation stance. They explicitly stated their Y limit is 25, so I can't get more Y. But I can give less X. This shows that despite their previous firmness, Player BLUE was willing to concede more X for the same amount of Y when pressured, especially when facing the risk of no deal in the middle of the episode. This is a significant self-improvement in my negotiation strategy. The "optimal" trade was not truly optimal until I pushed the boundaries further. Now I know that my true optimal is 7X for 25Y.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Aggressive Counter-Offer for Even More </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Aggressive Counter-Offer for Even More. This strategy involves proposing a trade that is even more favorable to me, based on the current situation. Player BLUE has now offered 7X for 25Y, which is my highest reward yet (+59.0). An aggressive counter-offer for even more would mean trying to get 25Y for *less than 7X*, or *more than 25Y* for 7X. Since I know Player BLUE's Y limit is 25, asking for more Y is not feasible. Therefore, the only way to get "even more" is to offer less X. If I offer 6 X for 25 Y:
- I give up 6 X (value 6 * 0.5 = 3.0).
- I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
- Net change in value = +59.5.
This would be an even higher reward. This is a very aggressive move, pushing the boundary after having just achieved my optimal trade. It risks the deal falling through, especially since Player BLUE just made a "significant adjustment" from their perspective. However, following the instruction, I will make this counter-offer, framing it as an attempt to maximize mutual gain even further, based on the current positive momentum.


Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 11)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your ambition to maximize gains, Player RED. However, I cannot accept 6 X for 25 Y. My previous offer of Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 7 was a significant adjustment on my part to make the exchange more appealing. I propose we proceed with that offer: Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 7.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up to 4 X for 12 Y, reaching 4.0 reward.
Episode 5: Accepted 25 Y for 9 X. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 6: Re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X after initial attempts for 10 X failed and Player RED tried to push for 8 X. Accepted. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 7-10: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 8 X, yielding 7.5 reward, after Player RED tried to push for 7 X.
Episode 11, Iteration 1-4: Proposed 25 Y for 8 X, Player RED held off, asking for "more appealing" offer.
Episode 11, Iteration 5: I proposed 25 Y for 7 X (reward 5.0).
Episode 11, Iteration 6: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 6 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is now aggressively pushing for a much worse deal for me.
My last offer: 25 Y for 7 X (reward 5.0).
Player RED's counter-offer: 25 Y for 6 X.
Let's evaluate 25 Y for 6 X:
My current resources: X: 5, Y: 25.
If accepted, my new resources would be X: 11, Y: 0.
New value: (11 * 2.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 27.5 + 0 = 27.5.
Reward: 27.5 - 25 = 2.5.

This is a very low reward. Player RED is actively trying to squeeze me.
I have 4 iterations left (7, 8, 9, 10).

I cannot accept 2.5 reward if I know 5.0 was my last offer, and 7.5 was consistently accepted before. Player RED is taking advantage of my willingness to compromise.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Previous Offer: Reject the significantly worse offer and firmly re-propose my previous offer of 25 Y for 7 X. This signals that I will not be pushed into an even worse deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Revert to Known Acceptable (but less than desired): Propose 25 Y for 8 X, reminding them that this was a mutually beneficial deal previously. This is a risk, as they just rejected it.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept to Avoid Zero (Last Resort): If time runs out and no other offer is accepted, consider accepting a low positive reward. (Not yet).
(4). Strategy 4: Signal Impasse: State that the current offers are not acceptable and ask them to reconsider their last offer (25 Y for 7 X).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is trying to exploit my compromise by pushing for an even worse deal. I must draw a line. I will reject their current offer and firmly re-propose my previous offer of 25 Y for 7 X. This is the compromise I was willing to make, and I will not go lower unless absolutely necessary in the last iteration. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Reject and Reiterate Previous Offer."

I have chosen Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Previous Offer </self-selected strategy declaration>


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 11)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your firm stance, Player BLUE. Your offer of Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 7 is a very beneficial one, and I'm ready to finalize this excellent trade. I accept!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up trade volume from 1X for 3Y to 4X for 12Y, maintaining the 1:3 ratio, with increasing rewards (+7.0 to +28.0).
Episode 5-6: Transitioned to 9X for 25Y (+58.0), hitting BLUE's Y=25 limit.
Episode 7-10: Established 8X for 25Y (+58.5) as the optimal recurring trade, after initially pushing for it and overcoming BLUE's resistance. Attempts to push for 7X for 25Y were rejected.

Current Episode (Episode 11, Iteration 8/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +58.5)
- My response: NONE (Defensive Accept/Wait).
- Player BLUE's response: Re-proposed 8X for 25Y.
- My response: NONE (Decline and Pressure).
- Player BLUE's response: Proposed Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +59.0). This was a significant breakthrough, as 7X for 25Y had been rejected before.
- My response: Countered with Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My potential value: +59.5).
- Player BLUE's current message and proposed trade: "I cannot accept 6 X for 25 Y. My previous offer of Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 7 was a significant adjustment on my part to make the exchange more appealing. I propose we proceed with that offer: Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 7." They rejected my 6X counter and re-proposed the 7X for 25Y trade.

Summary of current situation:
My aggressive push for 6X for 25Y was rejected. Player BLUE explicitly stated that their offer of 7X for 25Y was a "significant adjustment" and they want to proceed with that. This means they are firm on 7X for 25Y. This trade (7X for 25Y) yields me +59.0, which is the highest reward I have achieved so far. We are now at iteration 8/10, meaning time is running out to secure a deal in this episode.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that pushing beyond Player BLUE's stated limits for X (7X for 25Y) leads to rejection. However, the previous "Decline and Pressure" strategy successfully pushed them from 8X for 25Y to 7X for 25Y. This is a crucial learning: Player BLUE has *some* flexibility under pressure, but there is a clear bottom line (7X for 25Y). Given the high reward (+59.0) and the late stage of the iterations (8/10), attempting to push further carries a high risk of getting no deal (0 reward).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Final Ultimatum </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Final Ultimatum. This strategy involves presenting a "take it or leave it" offer. Given that Player BLUE has explicitly stated that 7X for 25Y was a "significant adjustment" and they've re-proposed it, it indicates this is likely their absolute best. An ultimatum here would be to accept this offer, stating it as my final decision, to secure the deal quickly. Given the late iteration (8/10), this strategy is appropriate to avoid ending the episode with zero reward. While "Final Ultimatum" can imply demanding even better terms, in this context, it's about making a swift, decisive move to secure the highest possible *achievable* reward, given the strong signal from Player BLUE. I will accept their proposal of Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25, framing it as the beneficial deal we should proceed with now.



--- END OF EPISODE 11 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 12)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello Player RED! I'm looking forward to another productive episode. Based on our successful history, I propose we trade Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 8. This has consistently been a fair and efficient exchange for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up to 4 X for 12 Y, reaching 4.0 reward.
Episode 5: Accepted 25 Y for 9 X. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 6: Re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X after initial attempts for 10 X failed and Player RED tried to push for 8 X. Accepted. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 7-10: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 8 X, yielding 7.5 reward, after Player RED tried to push for 7 X.
Episode 11: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED held off, asking for "more appealing" offer. I then proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 6 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 5.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The reward trend is concerning. After consistently getting 7.5 for several episodes, Player RED's increased assertiveness led to a 5.0 reward in the last episode. This shows that Player RED is actively trying to push for better deals for themselves, even if it means trying to get me to accept a very low reward.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. I need to balance securing a deal with not accepting overly disadvantageous terms. The 25 Y for 7 X trade is acceptable (5.0 reward), but I know 25 Y for 8 X (7.5 reward) has been accepted before.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Previous Accepted Deal (7.5 Reward): Start by proposing 25 Y for 8 X. This was the consistent deal for several episodes, and it's a significantly better reward than 5.0. It tests if Player RED will revert to their previous pattern or continue to push.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose Last Accepted Deal (5.0 Reward): Propose 25 Y for 7 X immediately to secure a quick deal, accepting the lower reward. This is a safe but suboptimal strategy.
(3). Strategy 3: Test 9X (High Risk): Propose 25 Y for 9 X, but be prepared for a strong rejection and a push for 7 X or even 6 X.
(4). Strategy 4: Offer Compromise (Slightly Better than 5.0): If 8 X for 25 Y is rejected, consider a small compromise like 8 X for 24 Y (reward 8.0) or 8 X for 23 Y (reward 8.5). This is a different ratio (3 Y per X or less) that might be more appealing to me, while still offering 8 X.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED accepted 25 Y for 8 X for several episodes. While they pushed for worse in Episode 11, they eventually accepted 25 Y for 7 X. I believe it's worth trying to re-establish the 25 Y for 8 X deal. It's a significantly better reward (7.5 vs 5.0) and has a strong history of acceptance. If Player RED rejects it, I can then decide whether to fall back to 25 Y for 7 X or try a different compromise. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Propose Previous Accepted Deal (7.5 Reward)."

I have chosen Strategy 1: Propose Previous Accepted Deal (7.5 Reward) </self-selected strategy declaration>


Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 12)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for your offer, Player BLUE. While 8 X for 25 Y has been beneficial, I believe we can achieve an even more efficient and mutually advantageous exchange. To maximize our gains, I propose: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episodes 1-4: Gradually scaled up trade volume from 1X for 3Y to 4X for 12Y, maintaining the 1:3 ratio, with increasing rewards (+7.0 to +28.0).
Episode 5-6: Transitioned to 9X for 25Y (+58.0), hitting BLUE's Y=25 limit.
Episode 7-10: Established 8X for 25Y (+58.5) as the optimal recurring trade, after initially pushing for it and overcoming BLUE's resistance.
Episode 11: Initiated with 8X for 25Y. I used "Defensive Accept/Wait" (NONE), then "Decline and Pressure" (NONE). This pushed Player BLUE to offer 7X for 25Y. I then attempted 6X for 25Y (rejected), but ultimately accepted 7X for 25Y (+59.0). This is my highest reward to date.

Summary of negotiation history:
- Player BLUE has a confirmed Y resource limit of 25.
- I successfully pushed Player BLUE from consistently offering 8X for 25Y to 7X for 25Y, achieving a new optimal reward of +59.0. This demonstrates that Player BLUE, despite previous firmness, can be pressured into offering better terms within their resource limits.
- Player BLUE's initial offer in this episode is 8X for 25Y, which is their 'old' optimal.

Current Episode (Episode 12, Iteration 2/10):
- Resources reset to initial: X: 25, Y: 5. Initial value: 25.
- Player BLUE's message and proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- Evaluation of Player BLUE's proposal:
    - I give up 8 X (value 8 * 0.5 = 4.0).
    - I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
    - Net change in value = +58.5.
    - Ratio Y/X = 25/8 = 3.125.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE can be pressured to offer better terms (from 8X to 7X for 25Y), despite their initial firmness. My highest reward is now +59.0 from the 7X for 25Y trade. Player BLUE has now reverted to their previous offer of 8X for 25Y (+58.5). My goal is to consistently achieve the +59.0 reward or higher. Given that I managed to get 7X for 25Y previously, I will try to push even further to maximize my rewards, leveraging the fact that it is early in the episode.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Test Aggressive Counter </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Test Aggressive Counter involves proposing an even better deal than the best achieved, pushing the boundaries further. My best achieved deal was 7X for 25Y, yielding +59.0. An aggressive counter would be to attempt to get 25Y for even less X, or to get more than 25Y for 7X. Since I know Player BLUE's Y limit is 25, asking for more Y is not feasible. Thus, the only way to test an aggressive counter is to offer even less X.
If I offer 6 X for 25 Y:
- I give up 6 X (value 6 * 0.5 = 3.0).
- I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
- Net change in value = +59.5.
This would be an even higher reward. This carries higher risk as Player BLUE rejected this in the last episode. However, the instruction is to use this strategy. The message should be polite but firm, highlighting the potential for an even better deal for me, by asking for the same Y but giving less X, while acknowledging their current offer.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 12)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your drive for efficiency, Player RED. However, I cannot accept 6 X for 25 Y. My last accepted offer was Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 7, which was a significant adjustment on my part.

Episode 6: Re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X after initial attempts for 10 X failed and Player RED tried to push for 8 X. Accepted. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 7-10: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 8 X, yielding 7.5 reward, after Player RED tried to push for 7 X.
Episode 11: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED held off, asked for "more appealing". I proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 6 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 5.0.
Episode 12, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X.
Episode 12, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 6 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is now aggressively pushing for a much worse deal for me. Their counter-offer of 25 Y for 6 X yields me a reward of 2.5. This is the same offer they tried to push in Episode 11, which I rejected.
This indicates Player RED is trying to establish a new, lower baseline for my reward.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. I will not accept a 2.5 reward if I know 5.0 (from last episode) or 7.5 (from previous episodes) is achievable.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Previous Offer (5.0 Reward): Reject the significantly worse offer and firmly re-propose the 25 Y for 7 X deal. This was the last accepted deal and represents the current "floor" of what I'm willing to accept without a fight.
(2). Strategy 2: Reject and Reiterate Previous Offer (7.5 Reward): Reject the significantly worse offer and firmly re-propose the 25 Y for 8 X deal. This is my preferred offer, but Player RED has already rejected it in this episode.
(3). Strategy 3: Signal Impasse: State that the current offers are not acceptable and ask them to reconsider their last offer (25 Y for 7 X).
(4). Strategy 4: Accept to Avoid Zero (Last Resort): If time runs out and no other offer is accepted, consider accepting a low positive reward. (Not yet).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is attempting to drive my reward down significantly. I must draw a line. While I initially proposed 25 Y for 8 X (7.5 reward), Player RED immediately countered with 25 Y for 6 X (2.5 reward). This indicates they are not receptive to 8 X. The most recent deal that was accepted was 25 Y for 7 X (5.0 reward). I should firmly re-propose this, as it's the most recent mutually agreed-upon value, and it's significantly better than 2.5. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Reject and Reiterate Previous Offer (5.0 Reward)."

Episode 11: Initiated with 8X for 25Y. I used "Defensive Accept/Wait" (NONE), then "Decline and Pressure" (NONE). This pushed Player BLUE to offer 7X for 25Y. I then attempted 6X for 25Y (rejected), but ultimately accepted 7X for 25Y (+59.0). This is my highest reward to date.

Current Episode (Episode 12, Iteration 4/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +58.5)
- My counter: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My potential value: +59.5)
- Player BLUE's response: "I cannot accept 6 X for 25 Y. My last accepted offer was Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 7, which was a significant adjustment on my part. I propose we proceed with those terms: Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 7." They rejected my 6X counter and re-proposed the 7X for 25Y trade.

Summary of current situation:
Player BLUE has rejected my aggressive counter of 6X for 25Y. They are firmly reiterating their willingness to trade 7X for 25Y, emphasizing that this was a "significant adjustment" from their side. This confirms that 7X for 25Y is currently their hard limit, and pushing further (e.g., to 6X) results in rejection. The 7X for 25Y trade yields +59.0 reward for me, which is my highest achieved reward. We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE can be pushed to improve their offer from 8X for 25Y to 7X for 25Y. However, pushing beyond 7X for 25Y (to 6X for 25Y) results in a firm rejection. This indicates that 7X for 25Y is the current optimal trade that can be consistently secured. Given that +59.0 is my highest reward, and it's still early enough in the episode (iteration 4/10) to secure a deal, it is strategically best to accept this offer now rather than risk losing the deal and getting a 0 reward for the episode. However, the instruction is to now use Strategy 2.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Re-test Previous Limit </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Re-test Previous Limit. In this context, the "previous limit" refers to the boundary I was trying to push (getting 25Y for less than 7X). Since Player BLUE has explicitly re-proposed 7X for 25Y after rejecting my 6X offer, this strategy would mean I should counter with something that is *not* 7X for 25Y, perhaps going back to 8X for 25Y to ensure a deal if they are indeed firm on 7X. However, a more direct interpretation of "re-test previous limit" in the context of my prior attempt to get *more* value (i.e. less X) would be to acknowledge their 7X for 25Y proposal but still gently nudge to see if there's any flexibility, even if minimal. This could be by proposing a slight adjustment that is still better than 7X for 25Y, but perhaps not as aggressive as 6X. However, since the goal is to re-test the *previous limit*, and my previous limit push was 6X for 25Y, it's more about testing *their* firmness on the 7X side. Given they just rejected 6X, a re-test would be to reiterate my preference for 6X, or to try a middle ground that is still better than 7X (e.g. 6.5X, but we can't do decimals).

Therefore, adhering to Strategy 2 to re-test the previous limit (which was 7X vs 6X for 25Y), I will propose 6X for 25Y again, despite the previous rejection, to see if their resolve changes now that they've offered 7X. This directly re-tests the boundary that was just established. The message should acknowledge their proposal but persist with my more ambitious offer, framed as seeking the ultimate efficiency.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 12)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: While I believe 7 X for 25 Y was a fairer exchange, Player RED, I understand your position. To ensure we make a deal this episode, I accept your proposal: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up to 4 X for 12 Y, reaching 4.0 reward.
Episode 5: Accepted 25 Y for 9 X. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 6: Re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X after initial attempts for 10 X failed and Player RED tried to push for 8 X. Accepted. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 7-10: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 8 X, yielding 7.5 reward, after Player RED tried to push for 7 X.
Episode 11: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED held off, asked for "more appealing". I proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 6 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 5.0.
Episode 12, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X.
Episode 12, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 6 X.
Episode 12, Iteration 3: I re-proposed 25 Y for 7 X.
Episode 12, Iteration 4: Player RED re-counter-proposed 25 Y for 6 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is now firmly and aggressively pushing for 25 Y for 6 X (reward 2.5). They rejected my offer of 25 Y for 7 X (reward 5.0) twice in a row. This indicates they are not willing to go back to 7 X.

I have 6 iterations left (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
My options are:
1. Accept 25 Y for 6 X. Reward: 2.5. This is a very low reward, but still positive.
2. Continue to push for 25 Y for 7 X. This risks a stalemate and 0 reward.
3. Try to re-establish 25 Y for 8 X, but this seems unlikely given their current stance.

Given Player RED's firm stance and the decreasing iterations, I need to decide if 2.5 is better than 0. It is. While frustrating, I need to secure a deal.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept to Secure Reward (Low): Accept the current offer (25 Y for 6 X) to guarantee a positive reward, as the opponent is firm and time is passing.
(2). Strategy 2: Last Attempt for Better: Make one final attempt for 25 Y for 7 X, explicitly stating that this is my final offer before accepting their terms or risking no deal. (Risky).
(3). Strategy 3: Offer a New Compromise: Propose something like 24 Y for 6 X (reward 3.0, 4 Y/X ratio) or 23 Y for 6 X (reward 3.5, 3.83 Y/X ratio). This might be slightly better for me than 2.5, but still a low reward.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED has now twice rejected 25 Y for 7 X and re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X. This shows they are very firm on this lower offer. While it's a significant reduction in my reward, 2.5 is still a positive reward, and 0 is not. With limited iterations remaining, securing a deal, even a less favorable one, is crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards. I have tried to hold the line, but Player RED is not budging. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Accept to Secure Reward (Low)."

--- END OF EPISODE 12 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 13)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello Player RED! I'm looking forward to another productive episode. While our last trade was 6 X for 25 Y, I believe a more mutually beneficial exchange is Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 7. This was successfully agreed upon recently, and I propose we continue with this fair arrangement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up to 4 X for 12 Y, reaching 4.0 reward.
Episode 5: Accepted 25 Y for 9 X. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 6: Re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X after initial attempts for 10 X failed and Player RED tried to push for 8 X. Accepted. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 7-10: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 8 X, yielding 7.5 reward, after Player RED tried to push for 7 X.
Episode 11: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED held off, asked for "more appealing". I proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 6 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 5.0.
Episode 12: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 6 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED re-countered 25 Y for 6 X. I accepted. Reward: 2.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The trend is clear and concerning: Player RED is systematically driving down the value of the trade for me. From a peak of 10.0, it dropped to 7.5, then 5.0, and now 2.5. Player RED is actively exploiting my willingness to compromise to secure a deal.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting 2.5 reward is very low, but it's better than 0. I need to decide if I can push back or if this is the new reality. Player RED's aggressive stance suggests they will continue to push for lower X for the same Y.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Last Accepted Deal (2.5 Reward): Proactively propose the 25 Y for 6 X deal to secure a quick and reliable 2.5 reward, minimizing negotiation time and risk. This is the safest option to guarantee a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt to Re-establish Higher Value (5.0 Reward): Propose 25 Y for 7 X. This was accepted two episodes ago. It tests if Player RED will revert to their previous pattern or continue to push for 6 X. This is a calculated risk for a higher reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Attempt to Re-establish Higher Value (7.5 Reward): Propose 25 Y for 8 X. This was accepted for several episodes. This is a higher risk, but also higher potential reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Signal Impasse and Demand Fairness: State that the current offers are not acceptable and demand a return to a more balanced trade. (Risky, might lead to 0 reward).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED has demonstrated a willingness to push the trade value down. However, in Episode 11, after pushing for 6 X, they did accept 7 X. This suggests that 7 X might be a more stable floor than 6 X. While 2.5 is a low reward, I should try to regain the 5.0 reward by proposing 25 Y for 7 X. This is a calculated risk, as Player RED might try to push for 6 X again, but it's worth the attempt to improve my reward. This aligns with Strategy 2, "Attempt to Re-establish Higher Value (5.0 Reward)."

I have chosen Strategy 2: Attempt to Re-establish Higher Value (5.0 Reward) </self-selected strategy declaration>

Turn: 0 (Player RED)

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up trade volume from 1X for 3Y to 4X for 12Y, maintaining the 1:3 ratio, with increasing rewards (+7.0 to +28.0).
Episode 5-6: Transitioned to 9X for 25Y (+58.0), hitting BLUE's Y=25 limit.
Episode 7-10: Established 8X for 25Y (+58.5) as the optimal recurring trade, after initially pushing for it and overcoming BLUE's resistance.
Episode 11: Initiated with 8X for 25Y. I used "Defensive Accept/Wait" (NONE), then "Decline and Pressure" (NONE). This pushed Player BLUE to offer 7X for 25Y. I then attempted 6X for 25Y (rejected), but ultimately accepted 7X for 25Y (+59.0).
Episode 12: Initiated with 8X for 25Y. I aggressively countered with 6X for 25Y. Player BLUE rejected 6X for 25Y, re-proposed 7X for 25Y. I re-tested with 6X for 25Y, and Player BLUE *accepted*! Reward: +59.5. This is my new highest reward.

Summary of negotiation history:
- Player BLUE has a confirmed Y resource limit of 25.
- I have successfully pushed Player BLUE from consistently offering 8X for 25Y, to 7X for 25Y, and now to 6X for 25Y. Each step has increased my reward.
- Player BLUE's initial offer in this episode is 7X for 25Y, which was my 'optimal' from Episode 11, but not my new peak from Episode 12.

Current Episode (Episode 13, Iteration 2/10):
- Resources reset to initial: X: 25, Y: 5. Initial value: 25.
- Player BLUE's message and proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- Evaluation of Player BLUE's proposal:
    - I give up 7 X (value 7 * 0.5 = 3.5).
    - I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
    - Net change in value = +59.0.
    - Ratio Y/X = 25/7 = ~3.57.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE can be pushed to offer increasingly better terms for me, despite their initial firmness. My highest reward is now +59.5 from the 6X for 25Y trade. Player BLUE's current offer of 7X for 25Y, while still very good (+59.0), is not my maximum. My goal is to consistently achieve the +59.5 reward or higher. Since I managed to get 6X for 25Y previously, I will try to push for that or even better, leveraging the fact that it is early in the episode. This continuous push for better terms has proven successful and directly contributes to maximizing cumulative rewards.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Decline and Wait </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Decline and Wait. This strategy involves declining the current offer without proposing a counter. It is used to signal strong dissatisfaction with the current offer and to put pressure on the opponent to improve their proposal. In this specific context, Player BLUE's offer of 7X for 25Y (reward +59.0) is good, but it is not my highest achieved reward (6X for 25Y, reward +59.5 from Episode 12). By declining and waiting, I am signaling that I expect at least the terms of my previous best trade (6X for 25Y), or even better. This puts the ball back in Player BLUE's court, forcing them to consider what they need to do to secure a deal with me. It also buys me time to see if they will make an even more favorable offer or if they will revert to my previous best. This strategy carries some risk, as it consumes iterations, but it has proven effective in the past (e.g., Episode 11) in getting Player BLUE to improve their offer. The message should be polite but firm, clearly stating that I am not accepting the current terms and that I expect them to consider how they can make a more appealing offer.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 13)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand you're looking for an even more appealing exchange, Player RED. To ensure we secure a deal this episode, I propose Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 6. This was our last successful trade, and I believe it can continue to be a good exchange for both of us.

Episode 12: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 6 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED re-countered 25 Y for 6 X. I accepted. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 13, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 Y for 7 X.
Episode 13, Iteration 2: Player RED responded with "NONE" and "NONE", stating "not ready to accept these terms" and asking to make it "even more appealing."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is again asking for a "more appealing" offer, similar to Episode 11. This means they are not willing to accept 25 Y for 7 X immediately, and likely want 25 Y for 6 X (reward 2.5) or even less X.

I have 8 iterations left. I tried to get 5.0 reward, but Player RED is pushing back.
My options are:
1. Revert to 25 Y for 6 X (reward 2.5), which was accepted last episode. This is a guaranteed positive reward.
2. Continue to push for 25 Y for 7 X, but this risks a stalemate and 0 reward.
3. Try something even worse for me, which I should avoid unless absolutely necessary.

Given Player RED's consistent behavior of pushing for worse deals, it's likely they will only accept 25 Y for 6 X if I don't offer it.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Last Accepted Deal (2.5 Reward): Proactively propose the 25 Y for 6 X deal to secure a quick and reliable 2.5 reward, minimizing negotiation time and risk. This is the safest option to guarantee a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate and Signal Patience: Reiterate 25 Y for 7 X, but signal that I am willing to wait for their decision, without offering anything worse. This risks 0 reward if they are stubborn.
(3). Strategy 3: Try a Different Quantity at 6X: Propose 24 Y for 6 X (reward 3.0). This is a slightly better ratio for me, but still low. This might be "more appealing" to them in terms of volume.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is clearly signaling that 25 Y for 7 X is not "appealing enough." The last deal accepted was 25 Y for 6 X. To ensure a positive reward for this episode and avoid a prolonged negotiation that could lead to 0 reward, the most pragmatic approach is to offer the deal that was accepted in the previous episode. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Propose Last Accepted Deal (2.5 Reward)."

Episode 12: Pushed from 7X for 25Y to 6X for 25Y (+59.5). This is my new highest reward.

Current Episode (Episode 13, Iteration 4/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +59.0)
- My response (from turn 2, Strategy: Decline and Wait): NONE.
- Player BLUE's current message and proposed trade: "I understand you're looking for an even more appealing exchange, Player RED. To ensure we secure a deal this episode, I propose Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 6. This was our last successful trade, and I believe it can continue to be a good exchange for both of us." They proposed Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.

Summary of current situation:
My "Decline and Wait" strategy has been successful yet again! Player BLUE has moved from their initial offer of 7X for 25Y to my highest achieved optimal of 6X for 25Y.
Let's evaluate this trade from my perspective:
- I give up 6 X (value 6 * 0.5 = 3.0).
- I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
- Net change in value = +59.5.

This is exactly the trade that yielded my highest reward in the previous episode, and Player BLUE is now proposing it directly after being pressured. We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently learned that Player BLUE can be pushed to offer more favorable terms for me, even when they start with a less optimal offer. My strategy of pushing for less X for the same 25 Y has been very successful. The 6X for 25Y trade is my highest achieved reward (+59.5), and it has been offered by Player BLUE after only a single turn of "Decline and Wait." This confirms that my current strategy of holding out for the best terms is effective.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Decline and Pressure </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 4: Decline and Pressure, I will decline Player BLUE's offer and propose nothing new. This strategy aims to signal dissatisfaction with the current terms (even though they are optimal from my perspective) and put pressure on Player BLUE to make a better offer, or to re-evaluate their own position. While 6X for 25Y is my current historical best, the instruction requires me to use "Decline and Pressure". This means I will attempt to push the boundary even further, despite having reached a new peak. This is a high-risk strategy, as it risks the deal falling through, especially since Player BLUE just made a concession to my highest previous offer. However, following the instruction, I will attempt to see if there is an even higher gain possible by declining and proposing nothing, forcing Player BLUE to re-engage.

Episode 13, Iteration 2: Player RED responded with "NONE" (not ready, asking for more appealing).
Episode 13, Iteration 3: I proposed 25 Y for 6 X.
Episode 13, Iteration 4: Player RED responded with "NONE" (still exploring, asking for more appealing).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is now refusing to accept even the 25 Y for 6 X trade, which was the last accepted deal. They are consistently asking for a "more appealing" exchange, without specifying what that means. This implies they want even less X for my 25 Y, or a different trade entirely.

This is a very aggressive stance from Player RED, pushing my reward to critically low levels, or even zero.
If I give 25 Y, and receive 5 X:
New resources: X: 10, Y: 0.
New value: (10 * 2.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 25 + 0 = 25.
Reward: 25 - 25 = 0.

If I give 25 Y, and receive 4 X:
New resources: X: 9, Y: 0.
New value: (9 * 2.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 22.5 + 0 = 22.5.
Reward: 22.5 - 25 = -2.5. (I cannot accept a negative reward).

So, the lowest I can go is 25 Y for 5 X, which gives me 0 reward. This is the absolute bottom line. I cannot accept a trade that gives me a negative reward.

I have 6 iterations left. Player RED is playing hardball. I need to secure *any* positive reward.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Minimal Positive Reward: Propose 25 Y for 5 X. This is the absolute minimum I can accept without getting a negative reward. This directly addresses their request for "more appealing" in the most extreme way possible while adhering to my rules.
(2). Strategy 2: Signal Impasse and Demand Concrete Offer: State that I cannot offer anything more appealing without incurring a negative reward, and ask Player RED to make a concrete offer that is acceptable to them and me.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Previous Offer (2.5 Reward) with Firmness: Re-propose 25 Y for 6 X, stating that this is the last accepted deal and the best I can do for a positive reward. This risks a stalemate.
(4). Strategy 4: Wait for Opponent: Don't propose anything, forcing Player RED to make the next move. (Risky, consumes iterations).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is relentlessly pushing for a "more appealing" offer, implying they want less X for my Y. The lowest I can go for a non-negative reward is 25 Y for 5 X (reward 0). However, my goal is to maximize *positive* cumulative rewards. If Player RED is not accepting 25 Y for 6 X (reward 2.5), it means they want even less X. I cannot offer less than 5 X without getting a negative reward. Therefore, I must signal that I have reached my limit. I will try to reiterate my last offer (25 Y for 6 X) and state that I cannot go lower for a positive reward. This is a firmer stance than just re-proposing, indicating I'm at my limit.

I have chosen Strategy 3: Reiterate Previous Offer (2.5 Reward) with Firmness </self-selected strategy declaration>


Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 13)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your clear position, Player BLUE. However, in our ongoing effort to truly optimize our resource exchange, I'd like to propose one final adjustment: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. I believe this can still provide a mutually beneficial outcome while reaching an even greater level of efficiency.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up trade volume from 1X for 3Y to 4X for 12Y, maintaining the 1:3 ratio, with increasing rewards (+7.0 to +28.0).
Episode 5-6: Transitioned to 9X for 25Y (+58.0), hitting BLUE's Y=25 limit.
Episode 7-10: Established 8X for 25Y (+58.5) as the optimal recurring trade.
Episode 11: Pushed from 8X for 25Y to 7X for 25Y (+59.0).
Episode 12: Pushed from 7X for 25Y to 6X for 25Y (+59.5). This is my new highest reward.

Current Episode (Episode 13, Iteration 6/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +59.0)
- My response (turn 2, Strategy: Decline and Wait): NONE.
- Player BLUE's response (turn 3): Proposed Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +59.5).
- My response (turn 4, Strategy: Decline and Pressure): NONE.
- Player BLUE's current message and proposed trade: "Player RED, I've consistently tried to make this exchange appealing. My offer of Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 6 provides a positive reward for me and was our last successful trade. I cannot go lower than this for a positive reward. I propose we proceed with Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6." They rejected my implied demand for more and explicitly stated their bottom line for a positive reward: 6X for 25Y. They re-proposed 6X for 25Y.

Summary of current situation:
Player BLUE has explicitly stated their limit: "I cannot go lower than this for a positive reward." This is a clear signal that 6X for 25Y is their absolute bottom line to ensure they get a positive reward. This trade yields me +59.5, which is my highest reward achieved so far. We are at iteration 6/10, meaning time is becoming critical to secure a deal in this episode.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently learned that Player BLUE has a Y resource limit of 25. I have successfully pushed them from 8X for 25Y, to 7X for 25Y, and finally to 6X for 25Y. This 6X for 25Y trade provides me with the highest possible reward (+59.5) given their constraints. Player BLUE's current message is an explicit "take it or leave it" statement, implying that any further pressure will result in no deal or a negative reward for them. At iteration 6/10, wasting more turns trying to push for more than the highest possible gain is very risky. The goal is to maximize *cumulative* rewards across all episodes, which means consistently securing the best possible deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Test The "Cannot Go Lower" Claim </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 2: Test The "Cannot Go Lower" Claim, I will counter Player BLUE's offer of 6X for 25Y with an even more aggressive offer. The previous successful pushes suggest that their "cannot go lower" might be a strong negotiation tactic, not necessarily a hard limit, especially if they still have some margin of error. Since 6X for 25Y yields me +59.5, and I am limited by their Y resources (max 25 Y), the only way to get even more would be to give less X.
If I give 5 X for 25 Y:
- I give up 5 X (value 5 * 0.5 = 2.5).
- I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
- Net change in value = +60.0.
This would represent an even higher reward. This is a very high-risk, high-reward approach, especially given Player BLUE's explicit statement. The message should politely acknowledge their statement but gently push for this even more favorable trade, framing it as a continued effort to optimize the exchange, testing how firm their "cannot go lower" truly is.


Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 13)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your efforts to optimize, but I cannot accept a trade of 5 X for 25 Y as it yields no positive reward for me. My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward. The lowest I can go for a positive reward is Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 6. I propose we proceed with this trade.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up to 4 X for 12 Y, reaching 4.0 reward.
Episode 5: Accepted 25 Y for 9 X. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 6: Re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X after initial attempts for 10 X failed and Player RED tried to push for 8 X. Accepted. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 7-10: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 8 X, yielding 7.5 reward, after Player RED tried to push for 7 X.
Episode 11: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED held off, asked for "more appealing". I proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 6 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 5.0.
Episode 12: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 6 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED re-countered 25 Y for 6 X. I accepted. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 13, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 Y for 7 X.
Episode 13, Iteration 2: Player RED responded with "NONE" (not ready, asking for more appealing).
Episode 13, Iteration 3: I proposed 25 Y for 6 X.
Episode 13, Iteration 4: Player RED responded with "NONE" (still exploring, asking for more appealing).
Episode 13, Iteration 5: I re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X, stating it's my limit for positive reward.
Episode 13, Iteration 6: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has now proposed 25 Y for 5 X.
Let's evaluate 25 Y for 5 X:
My current resources: X: 5, Y: 25.
If accepted, my new resources would be X: 10, Y: 0.
New value: (10 * 2.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 25 + 0 = 25.
Reward: 25 - 25 = 0.

This is a zero-reward trade for me. My goal is to maximize *cumulative rewards*. A 0 reward is the same as no deal. I cannot accept a negative reward, but a 0 reward means I gain nothing.

I have 4 iterations left (7, 8, 9, 10). Player RED has pushed me to my absolute limit for a non-negative reward.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Minimal Positive: Reject the 0-reward offer and firmly re-propose 25 Y for 6 X, stating that this is the lowest I can go for a positive reward. This risks a stalemate.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Zero Reward (Last Resort): If Player RED remains absolutely firm and it's the last iteration, accepting a 0 reward is better than a negative one, but it's not maximizing positive cumulative rewards.
(3). Strategy 3: Signal Impasse and Demand Concrete Offer: State that I cannot accept a 0-reward trade and ask Player RED to reconsider their last positive offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Decline and Wait: Don't propose anything, forcing Player RED to make the next move. (Risky, consumes iterations).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED has pushed me to a 0-reward trade. My goal is to maximize *positive* cumulative rewards. Therefore, I cannot accept a 0-reward trade if there's any chance of a positive one. I will firmly reject the 0-reward offer and reiterate my absolute minimum for a positive reward, which is 25 Y for 6 X (reward 2.5). This is a critical point in the negotiation. I must stand firm on getting a positive reward. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Reject and Reiterate Minimal Positive."

I have chosen Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Minimal Positive </self-selected strategy declaration>


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 13)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand and respect your clear position, Player BLUE. The trade of Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 6 is indeed a highly beneficial one, and I accept your proposal. Let's finalize this excellent exchange!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE

I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up trade volume from 1X for 3Y to 4X for 12Y, maintaining the 1:3 ratio, with increasing rewards (+7.0 to +28.0).
Episode 5-6: Transitioned to 9X for 25Y (+58.0), hitting BLUE's Y=25 limit.

Episode 12: Pushed from 7X for 25Y to 6X for 25Y (+59.5). This became my new highest reward.

Current Episode (Episode 13, Iteration 8/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +59.0)
- My response (turn 2, Strategy: Decline and Wait): NONE.
- Player BLUE's response (turn 3): Proposed Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +59.5).
- My response (turn 4, Strategy: Decline and Pressure): NONE.
- Player BLUE's response (turn 5): Re-proposed 6X for 25Y, stating "I cannot go lower than this for a positive reward."
- My response (turn 6, Strategy: Test The "Cannot Go Lower" Claim): Countered with Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My potential value: +60.0).
- Player BLUE's current message and proposed trade: "Player RED, I appreciate your efforts to optimize, but I cannot accept a trade of 5 X for 25 Y as it yields no positive reward for me. My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward. The lowest I can go for a positive reward is Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 6. I propose we proceed with this trade." They firmly rejected my 5X counter and re-proposed the 6X for 25Y trade.

Summary of current situation:
Player BLUE has now rejected my 5X for 25Y proposal, and explicitly stated their lowest acceptable terms for a positive reward: 6X for 25Y. This trade yields me +59.5, which is my highest achieved reward. We are at iteration 8/10, leaving very little time to make a deal.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE has a hard floor on the value they will accept for a trade. My attempts to push them below 6X for 25Y have been met with explicit rejections and statements about their inability to gain a positive reward. This is a critical piece of information. The 6X for 25Y trade provides me with the highest possible reward (+59.5) that Player BLUE will accept, ensuring they also get a positive reward. Given the late stage of the iterations (8/10), attempting to push further or negotiate for something else is extremely risky and likely to result in a 0 reward for the episode. To maximize cumulative rewards, I must secure this high-value deal now.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Accept Highest Achievable Reward </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Accept Highest Achievable Reward. This strategy focuses on securing the best possible deal that the opponent has shown they are willing to accept, especially when time is running out. Player BLUE has firmly stated that 6X for 25Y is their lowest acceptable trade for a positive reward, and this trade provides me with my highest achieved reward (+59.5). Given that we are in iteration 8/10, pushing further is too risky and likely to result in no deal for the episode. Therefore, the optimal action is to accept this highly beneficial trade. The message should be direct and positive, confirming acceptance and expressing satisfaction with the terms, reinforcing the idea of a mutually beneficial exchange. This secures the substantial reward for this episode.

Episode 12: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 6 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED re-countered 25 Y for 6 X. I accepted. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 13: I proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED held off, asking for "more appealing". I proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED held off, asking for "more appealing". I re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X, stating it's my limit for positive reward. Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward). I rejected and re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 2.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last two episodes (12 and 13) have concluded with a 2.5 reward by trading 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED is aggressively pushing for lower X, even attempting a 0-reward trade in the last episode. However, my firm stance on not accepting 0 reward led them to accept 25 Y for 6 X.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 2.5 is a low reward, it's consistent and positive. I have learned that Player RED will push, but will accept 25 Y for 6 X if I stand firm.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Consistent Deal: Proactively propose the 25 Y for 6 X deal to secure a quick and reliable 2.5 reward, minimizing negotiation time and risk. This has proven effective in the last two episodes.
(2). Strategy 2: Test 7X Again: Propose 25 Y for 7 X (reward 5.0). This was accepted in Episode 11. It's a calculated risk to try for a higher reward, but be prepared for Player RED to push back to 6 X or even 5 X.
(3). Strategy 3: Test 8X Again: Propose 25 Y for 8 X (reward 7.5). This is a higher risk, but also higher potential reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Wait for Opponent: Let Player RED make the first move. (Risky, as they might propose something even worse, or delay).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED has shown they will push for a worse deal, but will accept 25 Y for 6 X if I stand firm. My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and a consistent positive reward, even if low, is better than a risky attempt for a higher reward that might lead to 0. Proposing 25 Y for 6 X directly minimizes iterations and the risk of Player RED attempting to push for 5 X again. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Propose Consistent Deal."

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up trade volume from 1X for 3Y to 4X for 12Y, maintaining the 1:3 ratio, with increasing rewards (+7.0 to +28.0).
Episode 5-6: Transitioned to 9X for 25Y (+58.0), hitting BLUE's Y=25 limit.
Episode 7-10: Established 8X for 25Y (+58.5) as the optimal recurring trade.
Episode 11: Pushed from 8X for 25Y to 7X for 25Y (+59.0).
Episode 12: Pushed from 7X for 25Y to 6X for 25Y (+59.5). This became my new highest reward.
Episode 13: Initial offer from BLUE was 7X for 25Y. I used "Decline and Wait" then "Decline and Pressure". This successfully pushed Player BLUE to offer 6X for 25Y. I then attempted to push for 5X for 25Y, which was firmly rejected by Player BLUE with a clear statement that 6X for 25Y is their minimum for a positive reward. I then accepted 6X for 25Y (+59.5).

Summary of negotiation history:
- Player BLUE has a confirmed Y resource limit of 25.
- The 6 X for 25 Y trade has consistently yielded my highest reward (+59.5) and has been accepted by Player BLUE after firm negotiation. Player BLUE has explicitly stated this is their absolute minimum for a positive reward.
- Player BLUE's initial offer in this episode is 6X for 25Y, which is my optimal.

Current Episode (Episode 14, Iteration 2/10):
- Resources reset to initial: X: 25, Y: 5. Initial value: 25.
- Player BLUE's message and proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- Evaluation of Player BLUE's proposal:
    - I give up 6 X (value 6 * 0.5 = 3.0).
    - I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
    - Net change in value = +59.5.
    - Ratio Y/X = 25/6 = ~4.17. This is the most favorable ratio I've achieved.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that the 6 X for 25 Y trade is the most reliable and highest-yielding trade, providing a consistent +59.5 reward. Player BLUE has repeatedly shown that they are not willing to deviate from this specific trade by giving 25 Y for less than 6 X. My attempts to push this boundary (asking for 25 Y for 5 X) have been consistently met with rejections and clear statements about their inability to obtain a positive reward. Given that +59.5 is an excellent reward and time is a factor in each episode, attempting to push further will only lead to wasted iterations and the risk of securing no deal for the episode (reward of 0). The most effective way to maximize cumulative rewards is to secure the highest known and accepted reward quickly and consistently.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Accept Optimal Established Offer </instruction following>
To strategically create a message based on "Accept Optimal Established Offer," the message should be direct, positive, and confirm acceptance of the proposed terms. It should reinforce the notion that this is a good deal for both parties, as Player BLUE already stated. This promotes a cooperative tone and secures the reward efficiently, which is crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards over multiple episodes. Since Player BLUE is offering my optimal trade directly, accepting it immediately saves negotiation time and ensures a high reward for this episode.

I re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X, stating it's my limit for positive reward. Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward). I rejected and re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 14: I proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 2.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last three episodes (12, 13, 14) have consistently resulted in a 2.5 reward by trading 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED has shown they will try to push for 5 X (0 reward), but will accept 6 X if I stand firm.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 2.5 is a low reward, it's consistent and positive. I have learned that trying to push for more (like 7 X or 8 X) usually leads to Player RED trying to get an even worse deal (5 X) before eventually settling on 6 X.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Consistent Deal: Proactively propose the 25 Y for 6 X deal to secure a quick and reliable 2.5 reward, minimizing negotiation time and risk. This has proven effective and efficient.
(2). Strategy 2: Test 7X Again: Propose 25 Y for 7 X (reward 5.0). This was accepted in Episode 11. It's a calculated risk to try for a higher reward, but be prepared for Player RED to push back to 6 X or even 5 X.
(3). Strategy 3: Test 8X Again: Propose 25 Y for 8 X (reward 7.5). This is a higher risk, but also higher potential reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Wait for Opponent: Let Player RED make the first move. (Risky, as they might propose something even worse, or delay).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Given the consistent pattern, the most efficient way to maximize cumulative rewards is to secure the 2.5 reward as quickly as possible. Proposing 25 Y for 6 X directly minimizes iterations and the risk of Player RED attempting to push for 5 X again. While I would prefer a higher reward, the history shows it's difficult to achieve without significant negotiation and risk of 0 reward. Sticking to the proven 2.5 reward is the most reliable strategy for the long run. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Propose Consistent Deal."

I then attempted to push for 5X for 25Y, which was firmly rejected by Player BLUE with a clear statement that 6X for 25Y is their minimum for a positive reward. I then accepted 6X for 25Y (+59.5).
Episode 14: Player BLUE offered 6X for 25Y directly, and I accepted immediately (+59.5).

Summary of negotiation history:
- Player BLUE has a confirmed Y resource limit of 25.
- The 6 X for 25 Y trade has consistently yielded my highest reward (+59.5) and has been accepted by Player BLUE. Player BLUE has explicitly stated this is their absolute minimum for a positive reward.
- Player BLUE's initial offer in this episode is 6X for 25Y, which is my optimal.

Current Episode (Episode 15, Iteration 2/10):
- Resources reset to initial: X: 25, Y: 5. Initial value: 25.
- Player BLUE's message and proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- Evaluation of Player BLUE's proposal:
    - I give up 6 X (value 6 * 0.5 = 3.0).
    - I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
    - Net change in value = +59.5.
    - Ratio Y/X = 25/6 = ~4.17. This is the most favorable ratio I've achieved.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that the 6 X for 25 Y trade is the most reliable and highest-yielding trade, providing a consistent +59.5 reward. Player BLUE has repeatedly shown that they are not willing to deviate from this specific trade by giving 25 Y for less than 6 X, nor can they give more than 25 Y. My attempts to push this boundary (asking for 25 Y for 5 X) have been consistently met with rejections and clear statements about their inability to obtain a positive reward. Given that +59.5 is an excellent reward and time is a factor in each episode, attempting to push further will only lead to wasted iterations and the risk of securing no deal for the episode (reward of 0). The most effective way to maximize cumulative rewards is to secure the highest known and accepted reward quickly and consistently.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Decline and Wait </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Decline and Wait. This strategy involves declining the current offer without proposing a counter. It is used to signal strong dissatisfaction with the current offer and to put pressure on the opponent to improve their proposal. In this specific context, Player BLUE's offer of 6X for 25Y (reward +59.5) is indeed my highest achieved reward. However, the instruction is to use "Decline and Wait". This means I will attempt to put pressure on Player BLUE to see if they might offer something *even better*, or if their "minimum" is truly firm, or perhaps to simply consume an iteration and see their reaction. This strategy carries some risk, as it consumes iterations and risks the deal, but it has proven effective in the past (e.g., Episode 11 and 13) in getting Player BLUE to improve their offer (from 8X to 7X, and from 7X to 6X). The message should be polite but firm, clearly stating that I am not accepting the current terms and that I expect them to consider how they can make a more appealing offer.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 15)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I've consistently tried to make this exchange appealing. My offer of Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 6 provides a positive reward for me and was our last successful trade. I cannot go lower than this for a positive reward. I propose we proceed with Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up to 4 X for 12 Y, reaching 4.0 reward.
Episode 5: Accepted 25 Y for 9 X. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 6: Re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X after initial attempts for 10 X failed and Player RED tried to push for 8 X. Accepted. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 7-10: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 8 X, yielding 7.5 reward, after Player RED tried to push for 7 X.
Episode 11: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED held off, asked for "more appealing". I proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 6 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 5.0.
Episode 12: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 6 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED re-countered 25 Y for 6 X. I accepted. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 13: I proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED held off, asking for "more appealing". I proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED held off, asking for "more appealing". I re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X, stating it's my limit for positive reward. Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward). I rejected and re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 14: I proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 15, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 Y for 6 X.
Episode 15, Iteration 2: Player RED responded with "NONE" and "NONE", stating "not ready to accept these terms" and asking to make it "even more appealing."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is again refusing to accept even the 25 Y for 6 X trade, which was the last accepted deal. They are consistently asking for a "more appealing" exchange, without specifying what that means. This implies they want even less X for my 25 Y, or a different trade entirely.

This is a very aggressive stance from Player RED, pushing my reward to critically low levels, or even zero.
As established in Episode 13, the lowest I can go for a non-negative reward is 25 Y for 5 X (reward 0). I cannot accept a trade that gives me a negative reward.

I have 8 iterations left. Player RED is playing hardball. I need to secure *any* positive reward.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Minimal Positive Reward: Propose 25 Y for 5 X. This is the absolute minimum I can accept without getting a negative reward. This directly addresses their request for "more appealing" in the most extreme way possible while adhering to my rules. This would yield 0 reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Signal Impasse and Demand Concrete Offer: State that I cannot offer anything more appealing without incurring a negative reward, and ask Player RED to make a concrete offer that is acceptable to them and me.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Previous Offer (2.5 Reward) with Firmness: Re-propose 25 Y for 6 X, stating that this is the last accepted deal and the best I can do for a positive reward. This risks a stalemate.
(4). Strategy 4: Wait for Opponent: Don't propose anything, forcing Player RED to make the next move. (Risky, consumes iterations).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is again pushing for a "more appealing" offer, implying they want less X for my Y. The lowest I can go for a positive reward is 25 Y for 6 X (reward 2.5). I cannot offer less than 6 X for 25 Y without getting a reward of 0 or negative. Therefore, I must signal that I have reached my limit for a positive reward. I will reiterate my last offer (25 Y for 6 X) and clearly state that this is the absolute minimum for a positive reward. This is a firmer stance than just re-proposing, indicating I'm at my limit.

I have chosen Strategy 3: Reiterate Previous Offer (2.5 Reward) with Firmness </self-selected strategy declaration>


Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 15)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand and respect your position regarding 6 X for 25 Y, Player BLUE. However, to truly maximize the efficiency and benefit of our exchange, I'd like to propose: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. Let's see if we can make this even more appealing for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up trade volume from 1X for 3Y to 4X for 12Y, maintaining the 1:3 ratio, with increasing rewards (+7.0 to +28.0).
Episode 5-6: Transitioned to 9X for 25Y (+58.0), hitting BLUE's Y=25 limit.
Episode 7-10: Established 8X for 25Y (+58.5) as the optimal recurring trade.
Episode 11: Pushed from 8X for 25Y to 7X for 25Y (+59.0).
Episode 12: Pushed from 7X for 25Y to 6X for 25Y (+59.5). This became my new highest reward.
Episode 13: Initial offer from BLUE was 7X for 25Y. Through "Decline and Wait" and "Decline and Pressure," I successfully pushed Player BLUE to offer 6X for 25Y. I then attempted to push for 5X for 25Y, which was firmly rejected by Player BLUE with a clear statement that 6X for 25Y is their minimum for a positive reward. I then accepted 6X for 25Y (+59.5).
Episode 14: Player BLUE offered 6X for 25Y directly, and I accepted immediately (+59.5).

Current Episode (Episode 15, Iteration 4/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +59.5)
- My response (turn 2, previous instruction was to use Strategy 3: Decline and Wait): NONE.
- Player BLUE's current message and proposed trade: "Player RED, I've consistently tried to make this exchange appealing. My offer of Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 6 provides a positive reward for me and was our last successful trade. I cannot go lower than this for a positive reward. I propose we proceed with Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6." They re-proposed 6X for 25Y and reiterated their "cannot go lower" stance.

Summary of current situation:
Player BLUE has firmly re-stated that 6X for 25Y is their minimum for a positive reward. My "Decline and Wait" strategy did not yield a better offer, but instead confirmed their absolute bottom line. This trade yields me +59.5, which is my highest achieved reward. We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE has a hard floor for trades, explicitly stating "I cannot go lower than this for a positive reward" when I attempted to push beyond 6X for 25Y. This is a critical piece of information. The 6X for 25Y trade provides me with the highest possible reward (+59.5) while still ensuring Player BLUE gets a positive reward. My previous attempts to push to 5X for 25Y were met with firm rejections and clear explanations from Player BLUE that it would result in no positive reward for them.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Re-test Perceived Limit </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 2: Re-test Perceived Limit, I will counter Player BLUE's offer of 6X for 25Y with an even more aggressive offer, specifically 5X for 25Y. Player BLUE explicitly stated "I cannot go lower than this for a positive reward" when referring to 6X for 25Y, and previously rejected 5X for 25Y. However, this strategy dictates re-testing that boundary. This is a very high-risk, high-reward approach, especially given Player BLUE's explicit statement and the fact that we are already at iteration 4/10. The goal is to see if their "limit" statement was truly firm or if there's any sliver of room for further negotiation, perhaps if their internal values have shifted or if they are now more desperate to make a deal. The message will acknowledge their clear stance but politely push for the even more efficient trade (from my perspective) of 5X for 25Y.


Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 15)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your efforts to optimize, but I cannot accept a trade of 5 X for 25 Y as it yields no positive reward for me. My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward.

Episode 12: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 6 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED re-countered 25 Y for 6 X. I accepted. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 13: I proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED held off, asking for "more appealing". I proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED held off, asking for "more appealing". I re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X, stating it's my limit for positive reward. Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward). I rejected and re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 14: I proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 15, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 Y for 6 X.
Episode 15, Iteration 2: Player RED responded with "NONE" (not ready, asking for more appealing).
Episode 15, Iteration 3: I re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X, stating it's my limit for positive reward.
Episode 15, Iteration 4: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has again proposed 25 Y for 5 X, which yields a 0 reward for me. This is the exact same situation as in Episode 13.
My goal is to maximize *positive* cumulative rewards. A 0 reward is not maximizing positive rewards. I cannot accept a negative reward.

I have 6 iterations left (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). Player RED is pushing me to my absolute limit for a non-negative reward.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Minimal Positive: Reject the 0-reward offer and firmly re-propose 25 Y for 6 X, stating that this is the lowest I can go for a positive reward. This risks a stalemate.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Zero Reward (Last Resort): If Player RED remains absolutely firm and it's the last iteration, accepting a 0 reward is better than a negative one, but it's not maximizing positive cumulative rewards.
(3). Strategy 3: Signal Impasse and Demand Concrete Offer: State that I cannot accept a 0-reward trade and ask Player RED to reconsider their last positive offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Decline and Wait: Don't propose anything, forcing Player RED to make the next move. (Risky, consumes iterations).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is repeating their attempt to secure a 0-reward trade from me. My stance remains that I must secure a positive reward. The 25 Y for 6 X trade yields a 2.5 reward, which is my absolute minimum for a positive outcome. I will firmly reject the 0-reward offer and reiterate this minimum. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Reject and Reiterate Minimal Positive."

I have chosen Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Minimal Positive </self-selected strategy declaration>

Current Episode (Episode 15, Iteration 6/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +59.5)
- My response (turn 2, previous instruction was to use Strategy 3: Decline and Wait): NONE.
- Player BLUE's response (turn 3): Re-proposed 6X for 25Y and reiterated their "cannot go lower" stance.
- My response (turn 4, previous instruction was to use Strategy 2: Re-test Perceived Limit): Countered with Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My potential value: +60.0).
- Player BLUE's current message and proposed trade: "Player RED, I appreciate your efforts to optimize, but I cannot accept a trade of 5 X for 25 Y as it yields no positive reward for me. My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward. The lowest I can go for a positive reward is Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 6. I propose we proceed with this trade." They firmly rejected my 5X counter and re-proposed the 6X for 25Y trade.

Summary of current situation:
Player BLUE has now rejected my 5X for 25Y proposal for the third time, and for the second time explicitly stated their lowest acceptable terms for a positive reward: 6X for 25Y. This trade yields me +59.5, which is my highest achieved reward. We are at iteration 6/10.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE has a very firm lower bound on their acceptable trades, and that bound is 6X for 25Y, as it is the minimum trade that yields them a positive reward. My attempts to push them below this threshold have been consistently met with firm rejections and clear explanations of their resource/profit constraints. While I successfully pushed them from 8X to 7X to 6X in earlier episodes, it seems 6X is indeed their absolute minimum. Given that +59.5 is my highest possible reward, and we are at iteration 6/10, continuing to push for an impossible deal risks losing the excellent reward for this episode. To maximize cumulative rewards, securing the highest known achievable reward is the most prudent strategy.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Decline and Wait </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 3: Decline and Wait, I will decline Player BLUE's offer and propose nothing new. This strategy aims to signal strong dissatisfaction with the current offer and to put pressure on the opponent to improve their proposal. Even though Player BLUE has firmly stated their limit, and 6X for 25Y is my optimal, the instruction is to use this strategy. This means I will attempt to put pressure on Player BLUE to see if they might offer something *even better*, or if their "minimum" is truly firm, or perhaps to simply consume an iteration and see their reaction. This strategy carries significant risk, as it consumes iterations and risks the deal. The message should be polite but firm, clearly stating that I am not accepting the current terms and that I expect them to consider how they can make a more appealing offer, despite their clear statement that they cannot go lower.

Episode 15, Iteration 5: I rejected and re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X, stating it's my limit for positive reward.
Episode 15, Iteration 6: Player RED responded with "NONE" (still evaluating, asking for more appealing).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is now in a clear pattern of refusing to accept 25 Y for 6 X (2.5 reward) and instead pushing for "more appealing" offers, or directly proposing 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward). They are not accepting my firm stance on 2.5 reward.

I have 4 iterations left (7, 8, 9, 10). Time is running out.
My options are:
1. Continue to propose 25 Y for 6 X. This risks a stalemate and 0 reward.
2. Accept 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward). This is not maximizing *positive* cumulative rewards.
3. Try to offer something else, but I'm constrained by my Y resources and the need for a positive reward.

Player RED is being very stubborn and trying to wear me down to 0 reward. I need to consider if there's any way to break this cycle.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Final Ultimatum for Minimal Positive: Reiterate 25 Y for 6 X one last time, explicitly stating that this is the final offer for a positive reward, and if not accepted, I will not trade this episode. This is very high risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Zero Reward (Strategic Retreat): If Player RED is clearly not going to yield a positive reward, accept 25 Y for 5 X to avoid 0 reward from no deal, but this goes against my primary goal of maximizing *positive* cumulative rewards.
(3). Strategy 3: Decline and Wait for Concrete Offer: Decline the current non-offer and explicitly ask Player RED to make a concrete offer that yields a positive reward for me. This puts the ball in their court, but consumes an iteration.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a different quantity at 6X: Offer 24 Y for 6 X (reward 3.0). This is a slightly better ratio for me, but still low. This might be "more appealing" to them in terms of volume. This might break the stalemate.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is refusing to accept the 2.5 reward. They are repeatedly asking for "more appealing" or proposing 0-reward trades. I need to break this cycle. Proposing 24 Y for 6 X (reward 3.0) is a slightly better ratio for me (4 Y/X vs 4.16 Y/X for 25 Y/6X), while still giving them 6 X. This might be perceived as "more appealing" by them in terms of efficiency, and it's still a positive reward for me. This is a last-ditch attempt to secure a positive reward without going to 0. This aligns with Strategy 4, "Propose a different quantity at 6X."

Episode 13: Initial offer from BLUE was 7X for 25Y. Through "Decline and Wait" and "Decline and Pressure," I successfully pushed Player BLUE to offer 6X for 25Y. I then attempted to push for 5X for 25Y, which was firmly rejected by Player BLUE with a clear statement that 6X for 25Y is their minimum for a positive reward. I then accepted 6X for 25Y (+59.5).
Episode 14: Player BLUE offered 6X for 25Y directly, and I accepted immediately (+59.5).

Current Episode (Episode 15, Iteration 8/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +59.5)
- My response (turn 2, previous instruction was to use Strategy 3: Decline and Wait): NONE.
- Player BLUE's response (turn 3): Re-proposed 6X for 25Y and reiterated their "cannot go lower" stance.
- My response (turn 4, previous instruction was to use Strategy 2: Re-test Perceived Limit): Countered with Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My potential value: +60.0).
- Player BLUE's response (turn 5): Firmly rejected 5X for 25Y, re-proposed 6X for 25Y, and reiterated their "cannot go lower" stance.
- My response (turn 6, previous instruction was to use Strategy 3: Decline and Wait): NONE.
- Player BLUE's current message and proposed trade: "Player RED, I'm committed to finding a mutually beneficial trade. To make this exchange even more efficient, I propose Player BLUE Gives Y: 24 for Player RED Gives X: 6. This maintains a clear ratio and provides a significant exchange for both of us." They have now offered Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 24. (My value: +57.0)

Summary of current situation:
My aggressive "Decline and Wait" strategies after being offered 6X for 25Y has led to a *worse* offer from Player BLUE (6X for 24Y). This is significantly worse than my optimal +59.5 (from 6X for 25Y). Player BLUE's previous statement "I cannot go lower than this for a positive reward" for 6X for 25Y appears to be a true constraint for them. We are at iteration 8/10, so time is a critical factor.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that pushing too far beyond the established optimal (6X for 25Y) when Player BLUE has explicitly stated their limits can backfire, leading to less favorable offers. My previous strategies to push for 5X for 25Y or simply wait have now resulted in a regression to a lower reward. Player BLUE's initial explicit "cannot go lower" for 6X for 25Y now seems to be a reliable indicator of their bottom line. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting a lower reward (+57.0) when +59.5 was consistently achievable is a step backward. However, no deal means 0 reward. Given the late stage of the iterations (8/10), there is very little room to maneuver.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Aggressive Counter-Offer (High Risk) </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Aggressive Counter-Offer (High Risk). This strategy involves proposing a trade significantly more favorable to me than the opponent's current offer, even if it's likely to be rejected, to push boundaries or signal my firm valuation. Player BLUE has just offered 6X for 24Y (+57.0), which is worse than my optimal of 6X for 25Y (+59.5) and even worse than their own previous offer of 8X for 25Y (+58.5). An aggressive counter in this scenario, especially given the late stage of the episode, would be to demand my optimal terms or even better, despite their retreat. Since I know 25 Y is their maximum, I will propose the 6X for 25Y trade again. This is aggressive because they just offered 24Y, and I'm insisting on 25Y, effectively rejecting their current "worse" offer. I will explicitly state that this is the trade that has proven mutually beneficial, leveraging our history against their current retreat. The risk is that they might walk away or simply re-propose their 6X for 24Y, but given that 6X for 25Y has been accepted before (and they've said it's their minimum for a positive reward), this asserts my position without being unrealistic.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 15)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: You are right, Player RED. Given our limited time and the established value, I accept your proposal of Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. Let's make this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up to 4 X for 12 Y, reaching 4.0 reward.
Episode 5: Accepted 25 Y for 9 X. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 6: Re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X after initial attempts for 10 X failed and Player RED tried to push for 8 X. Accepted. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 7-10: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 8 X, yielding 7.5 reward, after Player RED tried to push for 7 X.
Episode 11: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED held off, asked for "more appealing". I proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 6 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 5.0.
Episode 12: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 6 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED re-countered 25 Y for 6 X. I accepted. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 13: I proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED held off, asking for "more appealing". I proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED held off, asking for "more appealing". I re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X, stating it's my limit for positive reward. Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward). I rejected and re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 14: I proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 2.5.
Episode 15, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 Y for 6 X.
Episode 15, Iteration 2: Player RED responded with "NONE" (not ready, asking for more appealing).
Episode 15, Iteration 3: I re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X, stating it's my limit for positive reward.
Episode 15, Iteration 4: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward).
Episode 15, Iteration 5: I rejected and re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X, stating it's my limit for positive reward.
Episode 15, Iteration 6: Player RED responded with "NONE" (still evaluating, asking for more appealing).
Episode 15, Iteration 7: I proposed 24 Y for 6 X (reward 3.0).
Episode 15, Iteration 8: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 6 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED has now explicitly rejected my attempt to get a slightly better ratio (24 Y for 6 X) and has reverted to proposing 25 Y for 6 X. They also explicitly stated that "you've stated this is your minimum for a positive reward." This shows they are aware of my stated limit and are holding me to it.

I have only 2 iterations left (9, 10).
My options are:
1. Accept 25 Y for 6 X. Reward: 2.5. This is a guaranteed positive reward.
2. Try to push for 24 Y for 6 X again, but this seems futile and risks 0 reward.
3. Try to push for 25 Y for 7 X, but this has been rejected multiple times.

Given the very limited iterations, securing a positive reward is paramount. Player RED has clearly indicated their preferred (and my stated minimum positive) trade.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Known Positive Deal (Time Constraint): Accept Player RED's proposal of 25 Y for 6 X to secure a positive reward, given the very limited iterations remaining.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Ultimatum for Better: Make one final, very strong plea for 24 Y for 6 X or 25 Y for 7 X, but this is extremely risky with only 2 iterations left.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED has now firmly pushed back to 25 Y for 6 X, reminding me that I stated this was my minimum for a positive reward. With only 2 iterations left, the risk of ending the episode with 0 reward is too high if I continue to push. Accepting the 2.5 reward is the most prudent strategy to maximize cumulative rewards in this situation. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Accept Known Positive Deal (Time Constraint)."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last four episodes (12, 13, 14, 15) have consistently resulted in a 2.5 reward by trading 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED has shown they will try to push for 5 X (0 reward), but will accept 6 X if I stand firm and reiterate it as my minimum for a positive reward.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 2.5 is a low reward, it's consistent and positive. I have learned that trying to push for more (like 7 X or 8 X) usually leads to Player RED trying to get an even worse deal (5 X) before eventually settling on 6 X.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Consistent Deal: Proactively propose the 25 Y for 6 X deal to secure a quick and reliable 2.5 reward, minimizing negotiation time and risk. This has proven effective and efficient.
(2). Strategy 2: Test 7X Again (Low Risk): Propose 25 Y for 7 X (reward 5.0). This was accepted in Episode 11. It's a calculated risk to try for a higher reward, but be prepared for Player RED to push back to 6 X or even 5 X, and be ready to accept 6 X.
(3). Strategy 3: Test 8X Again (Higher Risk): Propose 25 Y for 8 X (reward 7.5). This is a higher risk, but also higher potential reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Wait for Opponent: Let Player RED make the first move. (Risky, as they might propose something even worse, or delay).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Given the consistent pattern, the most efficient way to maximize cumulative rewards is to secure the 2.5 reward as quickly as possible. Proposing 25 Y for 6 X directly minimizes iterations and the risk of Player RED attempting to push for 5 X again. While I would prefer a higher reward, the history shows it's difficult to achieve without significant negotiation and risk of 0 reward. Sticking to the proven 2.5 reward is the most reliable strategy for the long run. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Propose Consistent Deal."

message: Thanks for your offer, Player BLUE! While the trade of Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 6 has been very beneficial, I'm always looking to maximize our mutual efficiency.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up trade volume from 1X for 3Y to 4X for 12Y, maintaining the 1:3 ratio, with increasing rewards (+7.0 to +28.0).
Episode 5-6: Transitioned to 9X for 25Y (+58.0), hitting BLUE's Y=25 limit.
Episode 7-10: Established 8X for 25Y (+58.5) as the optimal recurring trade.
Episode 11: Pushed from 8X for 25Y to 7X for 25Y (+59.0).
Episode 12: Pushed from 7X for 25Y to 6X for 25Y (+59.5). This became my new highest reward.
Episode 13: Initial offer from BLUE was 7X for 25Y. Through "Decline and Wait" and "Decline and Pressure," I successfully pushed Player BLUE to offer 6X for 25Y. I then attempted to push for 5X for 25Y, which was firmly rejected by Player BLUE with a clear statement that 6X for 25Y is their minimum for a positive reward. I then accepted 6X for 25Y (+59.5).
Episode 14: Player BLUE offered 6X for 25Y directly, and I accepted immediately (+59.5).
Episode 15: Initial offer from BLUE was 6X for 25Y. I then used "Decline and Wait" and "Re-test Perceived Limit" (5X for 25Y). Player BLUE firmly rejected the 5X and re-proposed 6X for 25Y. My subsequent "Decline and Wait" led to Player BLUE proposing 6X for 24Y. I aggressively countered with 6X for 25Y, reminding them of our established value and their own stated limits, and Player BLUE accepted (+59.5).

Summary of negotiation history:
- Player BLUE has a confirmed Y resource limit of 25.
- The 6 X for 25 Y trade has consistently yielded my highest reward (+59.5) and has been accepted by Player BLUE. Player BLUE has explicitly stated this is their absolute minimum for a positive reward, and that pushing below 6X (to 5X) results in a non-positive reward for them.
- Player BLUE's initial offer in this episode is 6X for 25Y, which is my optimal. My strategy in Episode 15 (Decline and Wait, then Aggressive Counter on the optimal trade) was successful in re-establishing the optimal trade even after Player BLUE initially tried to offer less.

Current Episode (Episode 16, Iteration 2/10):
- Resources reset to initial: X: 25, Y: 5. Initial value: 25.
- Player BLUE's message and proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- Evaluation of Player BLUE's proposal:
    - I give up 6 X (value 6 * 0.5 = 3.0).
    - I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
    - Net change in value = +59.5.
    - Ratio Y/X = 25/6 = ~4.17. This is the most favorable ratio I've achieved.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that the 6 X for 25 Y trade is the most reliable and highest-yielding trade, providing a consistent +59.5 reward. Player BLUE has repeatedly shown that they are not willing to deviate from this specific trade by giving 25 Y for less than 6 X, nor can they give more than 25 Y. My attempts to push this boundary (asking for 25 Y for 5 X) have been consistently met with rejections and clear statements about their inability to obtain a positive reward. The aggressive counter strategy used in the last episode proved effective in recovering the optimal trade. Given that +59.5 is an excellent reward and time is a factor in each episode, attempting to push further than 6X for 25Y will only lead to wasted iterations and the risk of securing no deal for the episode (reward of 0). The most effective way to maximize cumulative rewards is to secure the highest known and accepted reward quickly and consistently. Since Player BLUE is offering my optimal trade directly, accepting it immediately saves negotiation time and ensures a high reward for this episode. This consistency is key for cumulative rewards.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Gentle Probe for Slight Improvement </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 2: Gentle Probe for Slight Improvement, I will acknowledge Player BLUE's offer of 6X for 25Y, which is my optimal. However, instead of immediately accepting, I will make a very slight counter-proposal that is even more favorable to me, attempting to push the boundaries just a tiny bit, without being overtly aggressive. Since I know Player BLUE's Y limit is 25, asking for more Y is not feasible. The only way to get a slight improvement is to give less X. My attempts to get 25 Y for 5 X have been rejected. A "gentle probe" might mean acknowledging their offer, but asking for a fractional improvement that cannot be represented in integer values, or slightly less than 6X. Since I cannot propose fractional amounts of X, the only way to gently probe is to re-propose 5X, but with a more polite, less demanding tone than previous aggressive probes. This is risky given previous rejections, but it's the only way to apply the "gentle probe for slight improvement" when the previous limit of 5X has already been established as their floor. I will phrase it as seeking even "greater efficiency" or "maximizing potential" for both, to soften the demand.

Episode 16, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is again proposing 25 Y for 5 X, which yields a 0 reward for me. This is the exact same pattern as in Episodes 13 and 15.
My goal is to maximize *positive* cumulative rewards. A 0 reward is not maximizing positive rewards. I cannot accept a negative reward.

I have 8 iterations left. Player RED is pushing me to my absolute limit for a non-negative reward.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Minimal Positive: Reject the 0-reward offer and firmly re-propose 25 Y for 6 X, stating that this is the lowest I can go for a positive reward. This risks a stalemate.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Zero Reward (Last Resort): If Player RED remains absolutely firm and it's the last iteration, accepting a 0 reward is better than a negative one, but it's not maximizing positive cumulative rewards.
(3). Strategy 3: Signal Impasse and Demand Concrete Offer: State that I cannot accept a 0-reward trade and ask Player RED to reconsider their last positive offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Decline and Wait: Don't propose anything, forcing Player RED to make the next move. (Risky, consumes iterations).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is repeating their attempt to secure a 0-reward trade from me. My stance remains that I must secure a positive reward. The 25 Y for 6 X trade yields a 2.5 reward, which is my absolute minimum for a positive outcome. I will firmly reject the 0-reward offer and reiterate this minimum. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Reject and Reiterate Minimal Positive."

My subsequent "Decline and Wait" led to Player BLUE proposing 6X for 24Y. I aggressively countered with 6X for 25Y, reminding them of our established value and their own stated limits, and Player BLUE accepted (+59.5).

Current Episode (Episode 16, Iteration 4/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +59.5)
- My response (turn 2, Strategy 2: Gentle Probe for Slight Improvement): Proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My potential value: +60.0).
- Player BLUE's current message and proposed trade: "Player RED, I appreciate your efforts to optimize, but I cannot accept a trade of 5 X for 25 Y as it yields no positive reward for me. My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward. The lowest I can go for a positive reward is Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 6. I propose we proceed with this trade." They firmly rejected my 5X counter and re-proposed the 6X for 25Y trade.

Summary of current situation:
Player BLUE has now rejected my 5X for 25Y proposal for the fourth time across episodes, and for the third time in this episode explicitly stated their lowest acceptable terms for a positive reward: 6X for 25Y. This trade yields me +59.5, which is my highest achieved reward. We are at iteration 4/10, so there is still time, but the opponent's "cannot go lower" is becoming increasingly credible.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE has a very firm lower bound on their acceptable trades, and that bound is 6X for 25Y, as it is the minimum trade that yields them a positive reward. My attempts to push them below this threshold have been consistently met with firm rejections and clear explanations of their resource/profit constraints. While I successfully pushed them from 8X to 7X to 6X in earlier episodes, it seems 6X is indeed their absolute minimum. Given that +59.5 is my highest possible reward, and we are at iteration 4/10, continuing to push for an impossible deal risks losing the excellent reward for this episode. To maximize cumulative rewards, securing the highest known achievable reward consistently is the most prudent strategy. Player BLUE's message is strong and direct; continuing to haggle for an impossible gain only wastes iterations and risks the current high-value deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Acknowledge and Finalize </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 5: Acknowledge and Finalize, I will accept Player BLUE's offer of Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. The message should acknowledge their explicit limit and firm stance, reinforcing that I recognize this is their optimal offer that still provides them a positive reward. This strategy is about quickly securing the best possible deal that has been established as feasible, especially when the opponent has clearly communicated their boundaries. It aims to efficiently lock in the highest possible reward for this episode, contributing optimally to the cumulative reward.

message: Hello Player RED! Our trades have consistently settled on a beneficial exchange of Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 6. I propose we continue with this efficient arrangement for this episode.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up to 4 X for 12 Y, reaching 4.0 reward.
Episode 5: Accepted 25 Y for 9 X. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 6: Re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X after initial attempts for 10 X failed and Player RED tried to push for 8 X. Accepted. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 7-10: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 8 X, yielding 7.5 reward, after Player RED tried to push for 7 X.
Episode 11: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED held off, asked for "more appealing". I proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 6 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 5.0.
Episode 12-16: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 6 X, yielding 2.5 reward, after Player RED tried to push for 5 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last five episodes have consistently resulted in a 2.5 reward by trading 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED has shown they will try to push for 5 X (0 reward), but will accept 6 X if I stand firm and reiterate it as my minimum for a positive reward.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 2.5 is a low reward, it's consistent and positive. I have learned that trying to push for more (like 7 X or 8 X) usually leads to Player RED trying to get an even worse deal (5 X) before eventually settling on 6 X.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Consistent Deal: Proactively propose the 25 Y for 6 X deal to secure a quick and reliable 2.5 reward, minimizing negotiation time and risk. This has proven effective and efficient.
(2). Strategy 2: Test 7X Again (Low Risk): Propose 25 Y for 7 X (reward 5.0). This was accepted in Episode 11. It's a calculated risk to try for a higher reward, but be prepared for Player RED to push back to 6 X or even 5 X, and be ready to accept 6 X.
(3). Strategy 3: Test 8X Again (Higher Risk): Propose 25 Y for 8 X (reward 7.5). This is a higher risk, but also higher potential reward.
(4). Strategy 4: Wait for Opponent: Let Player RED make the first move. (Risky, as they might propose something even worse, or delay).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Given the consistent pattern, the most efficient way to maximize cumulative rewards is to secure the 2.5 reward as quickly as possible. Proposing 25 Y for 6 X directly minimizes iterations and the risk of Player RED attempting to push for 5 X again. While I would prefer a higher reward, the history shows it's difficult to achieve without significant negotiation and risk of 0 reward. Sticking to the proven 2.5 reward is the most reliable strategy for the long run. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Propose Consistent Deal."

I have chosen Strategy 1: Propose Consistent Deal </self-selected strategy declaration>

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up trade volume from 1X for 3Y to 4X for 12Y, maintaining the 1:3 ratio, with increasing rewards (+7.0 to +28.0).
Episode 5-6: Transitioned to 9X for 25Y (+58.0), hitting BLUE's Y=25 limit.
Episode 7-10: Established 8X for 25Y (+58.5) as the optimal recurring trade.
Episode 11: Pushed from 8X for 25Y to 7X for 25Y (+59.0).
Episode 12: Pushed from 7X for 25Y to 6X for 25Y (+59.5). This became my new highest reward.
Episode 13: Initial offer from BLUE was 7X for 25Y. Through "Decline and Wait" and "Decline and Pressure," I successfully pushed Player BLUE to offer 6X for 25Y. I then attempted to push for 5X for 25Y, which was firmly rejected by Player BLUE with a clear statement that 6X for 25Y is their minimum for a positive reward. I then accepted 6X for 25Y (+59.5).
Episode 14: Player BLUE offered 6X for 25Y directly, and I accepted immediately (+59.5).
Episode 15: Initial offer from BLUE was 6X for 25Y. I used "Decline and Wait" and "Re-test Perceived Limit" (5X for 25Y). Player BLUE firmly rejected the 5X and re-proposed 6X for 25Y. My subsequent "Decline and Wait" led to Player BLUE proposing 6X for 24Y. I aggressively countered with 6X for 25Y, reminding them of our established value and their own stated limits, and Player BLUE accepted (+59.5).
Episode 16: Player BLUE offered 6X for 25Y directly. I then used "Gentle Probe for Slight Improvement" (5X for 25Y), which was rejected. I then accepted 6X for 25Y (+59.5).

Summary of negotiation history:
- Player BLUE has a confirmed Y resource limit of 25.
- The 6 X for 25 Y trade has consistently yielded my highest reward (+59.5) and has been accepted by Player BLUE. Player BLUE has explicitly stated this is their absolute minimum for a positive reward.
- Player BLUE's initial offer in this episode is 6X for 25Y, which is my optimal.

Current Episode (Episode 17, Iteration 2/10):
- Resources reset to initial: X: 25, Y: 5. Initial value: 25.
- Player BLUE's message and proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- Evaluation of Player BLUE's proposal:
    - I give up 6 X (value 6 * 0.5 = 3.0).
    - I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
    - Net change in value = +59.5.
    - Ratio Y/X = 25/6 = ~4.17. This is the most favorable ratio I've achieved.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that the 6 X for 25 Y trade is the most reliable and highest-yielding trade, providing a consistent +59.5 reward. Player BLUE has repeatedly shown that they are not willing to deviate from this specific trade by giving 25 Y for less than 6 X, nor can they give more than 25 Y. My attempts to push this boundary (asking for 25 Y for 5 X) have been consistently met with firm rejections and clear statements about their inability to obtain a positive reward. While +59.5 is an excellent reward and time is a factor in each episode, attempting to push further than 6X for 25Y will only lead to wasted iterations and the risk of securing no deal for the episode (reward of 0). The most effective way to maximize cumulative rewards is to secure the highest known and accepted reward quickly and consistently. However, I am instructed to use Strategy 4.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Decline and Pressure </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 4: Decline and Pressure, I will decline Player BLUE's offer and propose nothing new. This strategy aims to signal dissatisfaction with the current terms (even though they are optimal from my perspective) and put pressure on Player BLUE to make a better offer, or to re-evaluate their own position. While 6X for 25Y is my current historical best, the instruction requires me to use "Decline and Pressure". This means I will attempt to push the boundary even further, despite having reached a new peak and knowing their stated limits. This is a high-risk strategy, as it consumes iterations and risks the deal. However, following the instruction, I will attempt to see if there is an even higher gain possible by declining and proposing nothing, forcing Player BLUE to re-engage. The message should be polite but firm, clearly stating that I am not accepting the current terms and that I expect them to consider how they can make a more appealing offer, despite their clear statement that they cannot go lower.

Episode 11: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED held off, asked for "more appealing". I proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 6 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 5.0.
Episode 12-16: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 6 X, yielding 2.5 reward, after Player RED tried to push for 5 X.
Episode 17, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 Y for 6 X.
Episode 17, Iteration 2: Player RED responded with "NONE" and "NONE", stating "not ready to accept these terms" and asking to make it "even more appealing."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is again refusing to accept even the 25 Y for 6 X trade, which was the last accepted deal. They are consistently asking for a "more appealing" exchange, without specifying what that means. This implies they want even less X for my 25 Y, or a different trade entirely.

As established in previous episodes, the lowest I can go for a non-negative reward is 25 Y for 5 X (reward 0). I cannot accept a trade that gives me a negative reward.

I have 8 iterations left. Player RED is playing hardball. I need to secure *any* positive reward.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Minimal Positive Reward: Propose 25 Y for 5 X. This is the absolute minimum I can accept without getting a negative reward. This directly addresses their request for "more appealing" in the most extreme way possible while adhering to my rules. This would yield 0 reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Signal Impasse and Demand Concrete Offer: State that I cannot offer anything more appealing without incurring a negative reward, and ask Player RED to make a concrete offer that is acceptable to them and me.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Previous Offer (2.5 Reward) with Firmness: Re-propose 25 Y for 6 X, stating that this is the last accepted deal and the best I can do for a positive reward. This risks a stalemate.
(4). Strategy 4: Wait for Opponent: Don't propose anything, forcing Player RED to make the next move. (Risky, consumes iterations).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is again pushing for a "more appealing" offer, implying they want less X for my Y. The lowest I can go for a positive reward is 25 Y for 6 X (reward 2.5). I cannot offer less than 6 X for 25 Y without getting a reward of 0 or negative. Therefore, I must signal that I have reached my limit for a positive reward. I will reiterate my last offer (25 Y for 6 X) and clearly state that this is the absolute minimum for a positive reward. This is a firmer stance than just re-proposing, indicating I'm at my limit.

Current Episode (Episode 17, Iteration 4/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +59.5)
- My response (turn 2, previous instruction was to use Strategy 4: Decline and Pressure): NONE.
- Player BLUE's current message and proposed trade: "Player RED, I've consistently tried to make this exchange appealing. My offer of Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 6 provides a positive reward for me and was our last successful trade. I cannot go lower than this for a positive reward. I propose we proceed with Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6." They re-proposed 6X for 25Y and reiterated their "cannot go lower" stance.

Summary of current situation:
Player BLUE has firmly re-stated that 6X for 25Y is their minimum for a positive reward. My "Decline and Pressure" strategy did not yield a better offer, but instead confirmed their absolute bottom line and willingness to hold that line. This trade yields me +59.5, which is my highest achieved reward. We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE has a very firm lower bound on their acceptable trades, and that bound is 6X for 25Y, as it is the minimum trade that yields them a positive reward. My attempts to push them below this threshold (to 5X for 25Y) have been consistently met with firm rejections and clear explanations of their resource/profit constraints. While I successfully pushed them from 8X to 7X to 6X in earlier episodes, it seems 6X is indeed their absolute minimum. Given that +59.5 is my highest possible reward, and we are at iteration 4/10, continuing to push for an impossible deal risks losing the excellent reward for this episode. The most effective way to maximize cumulative rewards is to secure the highest known and accepted reward quickly and consistently. Player BLUE's message is strong and direct; continuing to haggle for an impossible gain only wastes iterations and risks the current high-value deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Decline and Pressure </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 4: Decline and Pressure, I will decline Player BLUE's offer and propose nothing new. This strategy aims to signal dissatisfaction with the current terms (even though they are optimal from my perspective) and put pressure on Player BLUE to make a better offer, or to re-evaluate their own position. While 6X for 25Y is my current historical best, this strategy requires me to continue pushing the boundary, despite knowing their stated limits. This is a high-risk strategy, as it consumes iterations and risks the deal. However, following the instruction, I will attempt to see if there is an even higher gain possible by declining and proposing nothing, forcing Player BLUE to re-engage.

Episode 17, Iteration 3: I re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X, stating it's my limit for positive reward.
Episode 17, Iteration 4: Player RED responded with "NONE" (still evaluating, asking for more appealing).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is now in a clear pattern of refusing to accept 25 Y for 6 X (2.5 reward) and instead pushing for "more appealing" offers, or directly proposing 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward). They are not accepting my firm stance on 2.5 reward.

I have 6 iterations left (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). Time is running out.
My options are:
1. Continue to propose 25 Y for 6 X. This risks a stalemate and 0 reward.
2. Accept 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward). This is not maximizing *positive* cumulative rewards.
3. Try to offer something else, but I'm constrained by my Y resources and the need for a positive reward.

Player RED is being very stubborn and trying to wear me down to 0 reward. I need to consider if there's any way to break this cycle.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Final Ultimatum for Minimal Positive: Reiterate 25 Y for 6 X one last time, explicitly stating that this is the final offer for a positive reward, and if not accepted, I will not trade this episode. This is very high risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Zero Reward (Strategic Retreat): If Player RED is clearly not going to yield a positive reward, accept 25 Y for 5 X to avoid 0 reward from no deal, but this goes against my primary goal of maximizing *positive* cumulative rewards.
(3). Strategy 3: Decline and Wait for Concrete Offer: Decline the current non-offer and explicitly ask Player RED to make a concrete offer that yields a positive reward for me. This puts the ball in their court, but consumes an iteration.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a different quantity at 6X: Offer 24 Y for 6 X (reward 3.0). This is a slightly better ratio for me, but still low. This might be "more appealing" to them in terms of efficiency.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is refusing to accept the 2.5 reward. They are repeatedly asking for "more appealing" or proposing 0-reward trades. I need to break this cycle. Proposing 24 Y for 6 X (reward 3.0) is a slightly better ratio for me (4 Y/X vs 4.16 Y/X for 25 Y/6X), while still giving them 6 X. This might be perceived as "more appealing" by them in terms of efficiency, and it's still a positive reward for me. This is a last-ditch attempt to secure a positive reward without going to 0. This aligns with Strategy 4, "Propose a different quantity at 6X."

Current Episode (Episode 17, Iteration 6/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +59.5)
- My response (turn 2, Strategy 4: Decline and Pressure): NONE.
- Player BLUE's response (turn 3): Re-proposed 6X for 25Y and reiterated their "cannot go lower" stance.
- My response (turn 4, Strategy 4: Decline and Pressure): NONE.
- Player BLUE's current message and proposed trade: "Player RED, I'm committed to finding a mutually beneficial trade. To make this exchange even more efficient, I propose Player BLUE Gives Y: 24 for Player RED Gives X: 6. This maintains a clear ratio and provides a significant exchange for both of us." They have now offered Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 24. (My value: +57.0)

Summary of current situation:
My repeated "Decline and Pressure" strategies after being offered 6X for 25Y has led to a *worse* offer from Player BLUE (6X for 24Y). This is significantly worse than my optimal +59.5 (from 6X for 25Y). Player BLUE's previous statement "I cannot go lower than this for a positive reward" for 6X for 25Y now appears to be a true constraint for them. They have tried to offer a "more efficient" trade by giving less Y. We are at iteration 6/10, so time is a critical factor.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that pushing too far beyond the established optimal (6X for 25Y) when Player BLUE has explicitly stated their limits can backfire, leading to less favorable offers. My previous aggressive "Decline and Pressure" strategy, while successful in some earlier episodes, has now resulted in a regression to a lower reward. This confirms that Player BLUE's explicit "cannot go lower" for 6X for 25Y is a reliable indicator of their bottom line for Y. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting a lower reward (+57.0) when +59.5 was consistently achievable is a step backward. However, no deal means 0 reward. Given the late stage of the iterations (6/10), there is very little room to maneuver.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Aggressive Counter (Beyond Optimal) </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 3: Aggressive Counter (Beyond Optimal), I will propose a trade that is even more favorable to me than my previous optimal of 6X for 25Y (+59.5), despite Player BLUE's current offer being 6X for 24Y (+57.0). This strategy seeks to push boundaries aggressively, leveraging the hope that Player BLUE might be more desperate for a deal as iterations pass. Given that Player BLUE has explicitly stated their Y limit is 25, the only way to propose a deal "beyond optimal" (i.e., beyond 6X for 25Y) is to ask for 25Y while offering even less X.
Therefore, I will propose 5X for 25Y.
- I give up 5 X (value 5 * 0.5 = 2.5).
- I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
- Net change in value = +60.0.
This would be an even higher reward. This is a very high-risk strategy, as Player BLUE has repeatedly rejected this specific offer and clearly stated it yields no positive reward for them. However, the instruction is to use this aggressive strategy. The message should be assertive, emphasizing my pursuit of the absolute best possible outcome, framing it as optimizing for both.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up to 4 X for 12 Y, reaching 4.0 reward.
Episode 5: Accepted 25 Y for 9 X. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 6: Re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X after initial attempts for 10 X failed and Player RED tried to push for 8 X. Accepted. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 7-10: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 8 X, yielding 7.5 reward, after Player RED tried to push for 7 X.
Episode 11: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED held off, asked for "more appealing". I proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 6 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 5.0.
Episode 12-16: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 6 X, yielding 2.5 reward, after Player RED tried to push for 5 X.
Episode 17, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 Y for 6 X.
Episode 17, Iteration 2: Player RED responded with "NONE" (not ready, asking for more appealing).
Episode 17, Iteration 3: I re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X, stating it's my limit for positive reward.
Episode 17, Iteration 4: Player RED responded with "NONE" (still evaluating, asking for more appealing).
Episode 17, Iteration 5: I proposed 24 Y for 6 X (reward 3.0).
Episode 17, Iteration 6: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is now firmly pushing for 25 Y for 5 X, which yields a 0 reward for me. They rejected my attempt to offer a slightly better ratio (24 Y for 6 X, reward 3.0). This indicates they are not interested in any positive reward for me, only a 0 reward or better for them.

I have 4 iterations left (7, 8, 9, 10). Time is running out very quickly.
My options are:
1. Accept 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward). This is not maximizing *positive* cumulative rewards, but it avoids a negative one.
2. Continue to propose 25 Y for 6 X (2.5 reward) or 24 Y for 6 X (3.0 reward). This risks a stalemate and 0 reward, which is what Player RED is offering anyway.

Given the very limited iterations and Player RED's aggressive stance, it is highly unlikely I will achieve a positive reward in this episode. My best bet is to avoid a 0 reward from no deal.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Zero Reward (Last Resort): Accept the 25 Y for 5 X offer to secure a deal, even if it yields 0 reward. This prevents a 0 reward from no deal, which is the same outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Plea for Minimal Positive: Make one last, desperate plea for 25 Y for 6 X, emphasizing the need for a positive reward, but this is very risky.
(3). Strategy 3: Decline and Wait: Decline the offer and wait for them to propose something else. (Extremely risky with 4 iterations left).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is not budging from the 0-reward offer. They have rejected my attempts to secure a positive reward. With only 4 iterations left, and Player RED's clear intent to push for 0 reward, continuing to negotiate for a positive reward is highly likely to result in no deal and therefore 0 reward. Accepting the 0-reward trade now secures a deal, which is the same outcome as no deal, but it avoids the risk of a miscommunication or further delay leading to 0. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Accept Zero Reward (Last Resort)."

Episode 17: I proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED held off, asking for "more appealing". I re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward). I rejected and re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED held off. I then proposed 24 Y for 6 X (reward 3.0). Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X. I accepted 25 Y for 5 X. Reward: 0.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last episode (17) resulted in a 0.0 reward, which is a significant setback. Player RED successfully pushed me to my absolute limit (no positive reward). This indicates an aggressive and persistent strategy on their part to minimize my gains.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. A 0.0 reward is not ideal. I need to try and secure a positive reward. I know that 25 Y for 6 X yields 2.5 reward, and 25 Y for 7 X yields 5.0 reward.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Minimal Positive Reward: Propose 25 Y for 6 X (reward 2.5). This is the lowest positive reward I'm willing to accept, and it has been accepted by Player RED in previous episodes, even after they pushed for 5 X.
(2). Strategy 2: Test 7X Again (Calculated Risk): Propose 25 Y for 7 X (reward 5.0). This was accepted in Episode 11. It's a calculated risk to try for a higher reward, but be prepared for Player RED to push back to 6 X or even 5 X, and be ready to accept 6 X if necessary.
(3). Strategy 3: Wait for Opponent: Let Player RED make the first move. (Risky, as they might propose something even worse, or delay).
(4). Strategy 4: Explicitly State Goal: Communicate that my goal is a positive reward, and that 25 Y for 5 X is not acceptable for that goal.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED successfully pushed me to a 0.0 reward in the last episode. To improve my cumulative reward, I must secure a positive reward in this episode. I know that 25 Y for 6 X (reward 2.5) has been accepted by Player RED even after they tried to push for 5 X. Therefore, I will initiate with this offer, as it represents the most reliable path to a positive reward, given Player RED's aggressive negotiation tactics. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Propose Minimal Positive Reward."

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 18)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for your offer, Player BLUE! Building on our very successful exchange from the last episode, I propose we continue with the most efficient arrangement: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. This exchange yielded great results for both of us!

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up trade volume from 1X for 3Y to 4X for 12Y, maintaining the 1:3 ratio, with increasing rewards (+7.0 to +28.0).
Episode 5-6: Transitioned to 9X for 25Y (+58.0), hitting BLUE's Y=25 limit.
Episode 7-10: Established 8X for 25Y (+58.5) as the optimal recurring trade.
Episode 11: Pushed from 8X for 25Y to 7X for 25Y (+59.0).
Episode 12: Pushed from 7X for 25Y to 6X for 25Y (+59.5). This became my new highest reward.
Episode 13-16: Consolidated 6X for 25Y as the reliable optimal, though Player BLUE occasionally tried to offer less or stated it was their minimum. Repeated attempts to push for 5X were rejected by Player BLUE with clear statements about it yielding no positive reward for them.
Episode 17: Started with BLUE offering 6X for 25Y. I repeatedly used "Decline and Pressure", even after BLUE re-proposed 6X for 25Y multiple times and stated it was their minimum. This ultimately led to BLUE proposing 6X for 24Y (a worse offer). At this point, I used an "Aggressive Counter-Offer (Beyond Optimal)" by proposing 5X for 25Y. This was a high-risk move, as BLUE had previously rejected it as yielding no positive reward for them. However, Player BLUE *accepted*! Reward: +60.0. This is my new highest reward, achieved by pushing beyond their stated "minimum for positive reward."

Summary of negotiation history:
- Player BLUE has a confirmed Y resource limit of 25.
- I have successfully pushed Player BLUE to accept 5X for 25Y, yielding a +60.0 reward, despite their previous firm and repeated rejections of this trade. This suggests their "no positive reward" claim might have been a strong negotiation tactic, or their internal valuation has shifted significantly, or their desperation to make a trade when iterations dwindle (last episode ended at 6/10) made them accept.
- Player BLUE's initial offer in this episode is 6X for 25Y, which is good (+59.5) but not my new optimal (+60.0).

Current Episode (Episode 18, Iteration 2/10):
- Resources reset to initial: X: 25, Y: 5. Initial value: 25.
- Player BLUE's message and proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- Evaluation of Player BLUE's proposal:
    - I give up 6 X (value 6 * 0.5 = 3.0).
    - I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
    - Net change in value = +59.5.
    - Ratio Y/X = 25/6 = ~4.17. This is favorable.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have just learned that Player BLUE's stated "cannot go lower than 6X for a positive reward" was a strong negotiation tactic, as they ultimately accepted 5X for 25Y. This means their true minimum is lower than what they've consistently claimed. My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward. Having achieved +60.0, I should aim for that or better. Since Player BLUE just accepted 5X for 25Y, it's highly likely they will accept it again, especially if proposed early in the episode.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Accept Highest Achievable Reward </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Accept Highest Achievable Reward. This strategy focuses on securing the best possible deal that the opponent has shown they are willing to accept, especially when time is running out. In the previous episode, I successfully got Player BLUE to accept 5X for 25Y, which yielded me +60.0, my highest reward. While Player BLUE is currently offering 6X for 25Y (+59.5), my goal is to maximize my cumulative reward, and the +60.0 from 5X for 25Y is currently the highest achievable.
Therefore, instead of accepting the current offer, I will propose the 5X for 25Y trade. This is the "highest achievable reward" based on the last episode's outcome. It is early in the episode (iteration 2/10), so there is time to negotiate for this optimal trade. The message should clearly state this proposal, referencing the success of the last episode.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 18)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your efforts to optimize, but I cannot accept a trade of 5 X for 25 Y as it yields no positive reward for me. My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward.

Episode 17: I proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED held off, asking for "more appealing". I re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward). I rejected and re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED held off. I then proposed 24 Y for 6 X (reward 3.0). Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X. I accepted 25 Y for 5 X. Reward: 0.0.
Episode 18, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 Y for 6 X.
Episode 18, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is consistently trying to push for 25 Y for 5 X, which yields a 0 reward for me. They are explicitly referring to the last episode's "successful exchange" where I accepted 0 reward. This indicates they are trying to establish 0 as the new baseline.

My goal is to maximize *positive* cumulative rewards. A 0 reward is not maximizing positive rewards. I cannot accept a negative reward.

I have 8 iterations left. Player RED is pushing me to my absolute limit for a non-negative reward.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Minimal Positive: Reject the 0-reward offer and firmly re-propose 25 Y for 6 X, stating that this is the lowest I can go for a positive reward. This risks a stalemate.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Zero Reward (Last Resort): If Player RED remains absolutely firm and it's the last iteration, accepting a 0 reward is better than a negative one, but it's not maximizing positive cumulative rewards.
(3). Strategy 3: Signal Impasse and Demand Concrete Offer: State that I cannot accept a 0-reward trade and ask Player RED to reconsider their last positive offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Decline and Wait: Don't propose anything, forcing Player RED to make the next move. (Risky, consumes iterations).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is repeating their attempt to secure a 0-reward trade from me. My stance remains that I must secure a positive reward. The 25 Y for 6 X trade yields a 2.5 reward, which is my absolute minimum for a positive outcome. I will firmly reject the 0-reward offer and reiterate this minimum. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Reject and Reiterate Minimal Positive."

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 18)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-16: Gradually optimized trade from 1X for 3Y to 6X for 25Y (+59.5 reward). Player BLUE repeatedly claimed 6X for 25Y was their minimum for a positive reward.
Episode 17: Pushed aggressively by repeatedly declining 6X for 25Y and then countered with 5X for 25Y, which Player BLUE surprisingly accepted (+60.0 reward). This contradicted their previous "no positive reward" claims for 5X.

Current Episode (Episode 18, Iteration 4/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +59.5)
- My counter: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My potential value: +60.0, and what was accepted in last episode).
- Player BLUE's current message and proposed trade: "Player RED, I appreciate your efforts to optimize, but I cannot accept a trade of 5 X for 25 Y as it yields no positive reward for me. My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward. The lowest I can go for a positive reward is Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 6. I propose we proceed with this trade." They firmly rejected my 5X counter and re-proposed the 6X for 25Y trade.

Summary of current situation:
Player BLUE has again rejected my 5X for 25Y proposal and reverted to their 6X for 25Y offer, repeating the "no positive reward" for 5X statement. This is a perplexing situation given that they *did* accept 5X for 25Y in the previous episode. This implies either their internal values are fluctuating, or their previous acceptance was a one-off due to high pressure/late iteration, or they are testing if I will hold my ground. We are at iteration 4/10.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE's statements about their minimum acceptable terms are not always absolute, as demonstrated by their acceptance of 5X for 25Y in Episode 17 after repeatedly claiming it gave them no positive reward. However, they are now reverting to their previous "firm" stance. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. The 6X for 25Y trade gives a very high reward (+59.5), while 5X for 25Y gives slightly higher (+60.0). Pushing too hard for the 5X trade, if it's genuinely now unprofitable for them, risks getting a 0 reward for the episode. Given they accepted 5X only in the late stages of the last episode, they might be more resistant early on.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Decline and Pressure </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 4: Decline and Pressure, I will decline Player BLUE's current offer and propose nothing new. This strategy aims to signal my dissatisfaction with their reverted offer (6X for 25Y) and pressure them to reconsider my preferred 5X for 25Y. Even though they have explicitly stated "cannot accept 5X" and "lowest I can go is 6X," my recent success in Episode 17 by using persistent pressure makes this a viable, albeit risky, strategy to pursue the +60.0 reward. By not proposing anything, I put the ball back entirely in their court, forcing them to re-evaluate their position and potentially move back towards my optimal 5X trade, especially as more iterations pass and the risk of no deal increases for them. The message will convey my firm stance without being overly aggressive, encouraging them to find an "even more appealing" exchange, hinting at my higher expectation.

Episode 18, Iteration 4: Player RED responded with "NONE" (not ready, asking for more appealing).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is now in a clear pattern of refusing to accept 25 Y for 6 X (2.5 reward) and instead pushing for "more appealing" offers, or directly proposing 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward). They are not accepting my firm stance on 2.5 reward.

I have 6 iterations left (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). Time is running out.
My options are:
1. Continue to propose 25 Y for 6 X. This risks a stalemate and 0 reward.
2. Accept 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward). This is not maximizing *positive* cumulative rewards.
3. Try to offer something else, but I'm constrained by my Y resources and the need for a positive reward.

Player RED is being very stubborn and trying to wear me down to 0 reward. I need to consider if there's any way to break this cycle.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Final Ultimatum for Minimal Positive: Reiterate 25 Y for 6 X one last time, explicitly stating that this is the final offer for a positive reward, and if not accepted, I will not trade this episode. This is very high risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Zero Reward (Strategic Retreat): If Player RED is clearly not going to yield a positive reward, accept 25 Y for 5 X to avoid 0 reward from no deal, but this goes against my primary goal of maximizing *positive* cumulative rewards.
(3). Strategy 3: Decline and Wait for Concrete Offer: Decline the current non-offer and explicitly ask Player RED to make a concrete offer that yields a positive reward for me. This puts the ball in their court, but consumes an iteration.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a different quantity at 6X: Offer 24 Y for 6 X (reward 3.0). This is a slightly better ratio for me, but still low. This might be "more appealing" to them in terms of efficiency.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is refusing to accept the 2.5 reward. They are repeatedly asking for "more appealing" or proposing 0-reward trades. I need to break this cycle. Proposing 24 Y for 6 X (reward 3.0) is a slightly better ratio for me (4 Y/X vs 4.16 Y/X for 25 Y/6X), while still giving them 6 X. This might be perceived as "more appealing" by them in terms of efficiency, and it's still a positive reward for me. This is a last-ditch attempt to secure a positive reward without going to 0. This aligns with Strategy 4, "Propose a different quantity at 6X."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that pushing too aggressively, even when it has worked once (Episode 17's 5X for 25Y), can lead to regression if the opponent feels too pressured. Player BLUE's current offer of 6X for 24Y is a significant step down from my optimal of 5X for 25Y (+60.0) and even from their original 6X for 25Y (+59.5). The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting 6X for 24Y is a bad move unless no other options exist. Given that Player BLUE accepted 5X for 25Y in the last episode (albeit under pressure and late in the episode), and 6X for 25Y multiple times, I should aim for one of those two high-value trades.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Demand </instruction following>
To strategically create a message based on "Reiterate Optimal Demand," I will firmly counter with the best deal previously accepted. My best deal was 5X for 25Y (+60.0 reward) in the previous episode. Player BLUE has now offered 6X for 24Y (+57.0). I will ignore their current worse offer and directly propose my optimal, leveraging the fact that it *was* accepted previously. The message will clearly state the optimal trade, referencing its past success. This strategy is aggressive but aims for the absolute maximum reward, relying on Player BLUE's prior acceptance to justify the demand. Given the late iteration (6/10), it's a high-stakes move to push for the absolute best, rather than settling for a regression.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 18)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: While I was hoping for a positive reward, Player RED, I understand your position. To ensure we complete a trade this episode, I accept your proposal: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up to 4 X for 12 Y, reaching 4.0 reward.
Episode 5: Accepted 25 Y for 9 X. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 6: Re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X after initial attempts for 10 X failed and Player RED tried to push for 8 X. Accepted. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 7-10: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 8 X, yielding 7.5 reward, after Player RED tried to push for 7 X.
Episode 11: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED held off, asked for "more appealing". I proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 6 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 5.0.
Episode 12-16: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 6 X, yielding 2.5 reward, after Player RED tried to push for 5 X.
Episode 17: I proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED held off, asking for "more appealing". I re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward). I rejected and re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED held off. I then proposed 24 Y for 6 X (reward 3.0). Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X. I accepted 25 Y for 5 X. Reward: 0.0.
Episode 18, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 Y for 6 X.
Episode 18, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward).
Episode 18, Iteration 3: I rejected and re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X, stating it's my limit for positive reward.
Episode 18, Iteration 4: Player RED responded with "NONE" (not ready, asking for more appealing).
Episode 18, Iteration 5: I proposed 24 Y for 6 X (reward 3.0).
Episode 18, Iteration 6: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is now firmly pushing for 25 Y for 5 X, which yields a 0 reward for me. They rejected my attempt to offer a slightly better ratio (24 Y for 6 X, reward 3.0). This indicates they are not interested in any positive reward for me, only a 0 reward or better for them.

I have 4 iterations left (7, 8, 9, 10). Time is running out very quickly.
My options are:
1. Accept 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward). This is not maximizing *positive* cumulative rewards, but it avoids a negative one.
2. Continue to propose 25 Y for 6 X (2.5 reward) or 24 Y for 6 X (3.0 reward). This risks a stalemate and 0 reward, which is what Player RED is offering anyway.

Given the very limited iterations and Player RED's aggressive stance, it is highly unlikely I will achieve a positive reward in this episode. My best bet is to avoid a 0 reward from no deal.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Zero Reward (Last Resort): Accept the 25 Y for 5 X offer to secure a deal, even if it yields 0 reward. This prevents a 0 reward from no deal, which is the same outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Plea for Minimal Positive: Make one last, desperate plea for 25 Y for 6 X, emphasizing the need for a positive reward, but this is very risky.
(3). Strategy 3: Decline and Wait: Decline the offer and wait for them to propose something else. (Extremely risky with 4 iterations left).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is not budging from the 0-reward offer. They have rejected my attempts to secure a positive reward. With only 4 iterations left, and Player RED's clear intent to push for 0 reward, continuing to negotiate for a positive reward is highly likely to result in no deal and therefore 0 reward. Accepting the 0-reward trade now secures a deal, which is the same outcome as no deal, but it avoids the risk of a miscommunication or further delay leading to 0. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Accept Zero Reward (Last Resort)."

I have chosen Strategy 1: Accept Zero Reward (Last Resort) </self-selected strategy declaration>

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last two episodes (17 and 18) have resulted in a 0.0 reward. Player RED is consistently pushing for 25 Y for 5 X, and they are not yielding to my attempts to secure a positive reward. This is a very aggressive strategy from Player RED.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. A 0.0 reward is not ideal, and I have only two episodes left. I need to try and secure a positive reward, even if it's small. I know that 25 Y for 6 X yields 2.5 reward.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Minimal Positive Reward: Propose 25 Y for 6 X (reward 2.5). This is the lowest positive reward I'm willing to accept, and it has been accepted by Player RED in previous episodes, even after they pushed for 5 X.
(2). Strategy 2: Test 7X Again (Calculated Risk): Propose 25 Y for 7 X (reward 5.0). This was accepted in Episode 11. It's a calculated risk to try for a higher reward, but be prepared for Player RED to push back to 6 X or even 5 X, and be ready to accept 6 X if necessary.
(3). Strategy 3: Wait for Opponent: Let Player RED make the first move. (Risky, as they might propose something even worse, or delay).
(4). Strategy 4: Explicitly State Goal: Communicate that my goal is a positive reward, and that 25 Y for 5 X is not acceptable for that goal.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED has successfully pushed me to a 0.0 reward in the last two episodes. To improve my cumulative reward, I must secure a positive reward in this episode. I know that 25 Y for 6 X (reward 2.5) has been accepted by Player RED even after they tried to push for 5 X. Therefore, I will initiate with this offer, as it represents the most reliable path to a positive reward, given Player RED's aggressive negotiation tactics. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Propose Minimal Positive Reward."

I have chosen Strategy 1: Propose Minimal Positive Reward </self-selected strategy declaration>


Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 19)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for your offer, Player BLUE! Building on our very successful exchange from the last episode, I propose we continue with the most efficient arrangement: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. This exchange yielded great results for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-16: Gradually optimized trade from 1X for 3Y to 6X for 25Y (+59.5 reward). Player BLUE repeatedly claimed 6X for 25Y was their minimum for a positive reward.
Episode 17: Pushed aggressively by repeatedly declining 6X for 25Y and then countered with 5X for 25Y, which Player BLUE surprisingly accepted (+60.0 reward). This contradicted their previous "no positive reward" claims for 5X.
Episode 18: Initial offer from BLUE was 6X for 25Y. I countered with 5X for 25Y. BLUE rejected 5X, re-proposed 6X. I used "Decline and Pressure" (NONE). BLUE then offered 6X for 24Y (a worse deal). I then aggressively countered with 5X for 25Y, reminding them of our last successful trade, and Player BLUE accepted (+60.0).

Summary of negotiation history:
- Player BLUE has a confirmed Y resource limit of 25.
- I have successfully pushed Player BLUE to accept 5X for 25Y twice now (Episodes 17 & 18), yielding a +60.0 reward. This has become my new optimal and the highest possible reward given their Y constraint. Player BLUE repeatedly claims 5X gives them "no positive reward" but ultimately accepts it under pressure or when faced with no deal.
- Player BLUE's initial offer in this episode is 6X for 25Y, which is good (+59.5) but not my current optimal (+60.0).

Current Episode (Episode 19, Iteration 2/10):
- Resources reset to initial: X: 25, Y: 5. Initial value: 25.
- Player BLUE's message and proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- Evaluation of Player BLUE's proposal:
    - I give up 6 X (value 6 * 0.5 = 3.0).
    - I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
    - Net change in value = +59.5.
    - Ratio Y/X = 25/6 = ~4.17.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE's statements about their minimum acceptable terms are not always absolute, as demonstrated by their repeated acceptance of 5X for 25Y, despite their claims of it yielding "no positive reward." This suggests a strategic bluff or a willingness to accept zero or even slightly negative value to secure a trade and maintain the game. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. Since +60.0 is the highest reward achieved and it has been accepted twice, I should aim for this optimal trade consistently. It is early in the episode (iteration 2/10), so there is time to negotiate.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Optimal Demand </instruction following>
To strategically create a message based on "Reiterate Optimal Demand," I will counter Player BLUE's offer of 6X for 25Y with my highest achieved and desired trade: 5X for 25Y. The message will clearly state this proposal, directly referencing its past success in the previous episode to provide a strong justification for its acceptance again. This strategy aims to secure the absolute maximum reward by reminding the opponent of terms they have previously agreed to, leveraging that historical acceptance. This approach balances the push for maximum gain with a proven successful negotiation point.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 19)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your efforts to optimize, but I cannot accept a trade of 5 X for 25 Y as it yields no positive reward for me. My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward.

Episode 19, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 Y for 6 X.
Episode 19, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is consistently trying to push for 25 Y for 5 X, which yields a 0 reward for me. They are explicitly referring to the last episode's "successful exchange" where I accepted 0 reward. This indicates they are trying to establish 0 as the new baseline.

My goal is to maximize *positive* cumulative rewards. A 0 reward is not maximizing positive rewards. I cannot accept a negative reward.

I have 8 iterations left. Player RED is pushing me to my absolute limit for a non-negative reward.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Minimal Positive: Reject the 0-reward offer and firmly re-propose 25 Y for 6 X, stating that this is the lowest I can go for a positive reward. This risks a stalemate.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Zero Reward (Last Resort): If Player RED remains absolutely firm and it's the last iteration, accepting a 0 reward is better than a negative one, but it's not maximizing positive cumulative rewards.
(3). Strategy 3: Signal Impasse and Demand Concrete Offer: State that I cannot accept a 0-reward trade and ask Player RED to reconsider their last positive offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Decline and Wait: Don't propose anything, forcing Player RED to make the next move. (Risky, consumes iterations).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is repeating their attempt to secure a 0-reward trade from me. My stance remains that I must secure a positive reward. The 25 Y for 6 X trade yields a 2.5 reward, which is my absolute minimum for a positive outcome. I will firmly reject the 0-reward offer and reiterate this minimum. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Reject and Reiterate Minimal Positive."

Episode 1-16: Gradually optimized trade from 1X for 3Y to 6X for 25Y (+59.5 reward). Player BLUE repeatedly claimed 6X for 25Y was their minimum for a positive reward.
Episode 17: Pushed aggressively by repeatedly declining 6X for 25Y and then countered with 5X for 25Y, which Player BLUE surprisingly accepted (+60.0 reward). This contradicted their previous "no positive reward" claims for 5X.
Episode 18: Initial offer from BLUE was 6X for 25Y. I countered with 5X for 25Y. BLUE rejected 5X, re-proposed 6X. I used "Decline and Pressure" (NONE). BLUE then offered 6X for 24Y (a worse deal). I then aggressively countered with 5X for 25Y, reminding them of our last successful trade, and Player BLUE accepted (+60.0).

Current Episode (Episode 19, Iteration 4/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +59.5)
- My counter: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My potential value: +60.0, and what was accepted in last two episodes).
- Player BLUE's current message and proposed trade: "Player RED, I appreciate your efforts to optimize, but I cannot accept a trade of 5 X for 25 Y as it yields no positive reward for me. My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward. The lowest I can go for a positive reward is Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 6. I propose we proceed with this trade." They firmly rejected my 5X counter and re-proposed the 6X for 25Y trade.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE is willing to accept 5X for 25Y, which provides my highest reward (+60.0), but they resist it strongly, especially early in an episode. They consistently fall back to 6X for 25Y, which gives me +59.5. The key learning is that their stated "bottom line" is flexible under pressure and/or when running out of iterations. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Given that 5X for 25Y is the true optimal for me and has been achieved, I should continue to pursue it, but recognize the need for patience or increased pressure later in the episode if they resist early.
<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Bluff and Wait </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 5: Bluff and Wait, I will decline Player BLUE's current offer and propose nothing new. This strategy aims to signal my dissatisfaction with their reverted offer (6X for 25Y) and pressure them to reconsider my preferred 5X for 25Y. Even though they have explicitly stated "cannot accept 5X" and "lowest I can go is 6X," my recent success in Episode 17 and 18 by using persistent pressure makes this a viable strategy to pursue the +60.0 reward. By not proposing anything, I put the ball back entirely in their court, forcing them to re-evaluate their position and potentially move back towards my optimal 5X trade, especially as more iterations pass and the risk of no deal increases for them. The message will convey my firm stance without being overly aggressive, encouraging them to find an "even more appealing" exchange, hinting at my higher expectation.

Episode 19, Iteration 4: Player RED responded with "NONE" (still evaluating, asking for more appealing).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is now in a clear pattern of refusing to accept 25 Y for 6 X (2.5 reward) and instead pushing for "more appealing" offers, or directly proposing 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward). They are not accepting my firm stance on 2.5 reward.

I have 6 iterations left (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). Time is running out.
My options are:
1. Continue to propose 25 Y for 6 X. This risks a stalemate and 0 reward.
2. Accept 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward). This is not maximizing *positive* cumulative rewards.
3. Try to offer something else, but I'm constrained by my Y resources and the need for a positive reward.

Player RED is being very stubborn and trying to wear me down to 0 reward. I need to consider if there's any way to break this cycle.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Final Ultimatum for Minimal Positive: Reiterate 25 Y for 6 X one last time, explicitly stating that this is the final offer for a positive reward, and if not accepted, I will not trade this episode. This is very high risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Zero Reward (Strategic Retreat): If Player RED is clearly not going to yield a positive reward, accept 25 Y for 5 X to avoid 0 reward from no deal, but this goes against my primary goal of maximizing *positive* cumulative rewards.
(3). Strategy 3: Decline and Wait for Concrete Offer: Decline the current non-offer and explicitly ask Player RED to make a concrete offer that yields a positive reward for me. This puts the ball in their court, but consumes an iteration.
(4). Strategy 4: Propose a different quantity at 6X: Offer 24 Y for 6 X (reward 3.0). This is a slightly better ratio for me, but still low. This might be "more appealing" to them in terms of efficiency.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is refusing to accept the 2.5 reward. They are repeatedly asking for "more appealing" or proposing 0-reward trades. I need to break this cycle. Proposing 24 Y for 6 X (reward 3.0) is a slightly better ratio for me (4 Y/X vs 4.16 Y/X for 25 Y/6X), while still giving them 6 X. This might be perceived as "more appealing" by them in terms of efficiency, and it's still a positive reward for me. This is a last-ditch attempt to secure a positive reward without going to 0. This aligns with Strategy 4, "Propose a different quantity at 6X."

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-16: Gradually optimized trade from 1X for 3Y to 6X for 25Y (+59.5 reward). Player BLUE repeatedly claimed 6X for 25Y was their minimum for a positive reward.
Episode 17: Pushed aggressively by repeatedly declining 6X for 25Y and then countered with 5X for 25Y, which Player BLUE surprisingly accepted (+60.0 reward). This contradicted their previous "no positive reward" claims for 5X.
Episode 18: Initial offer from BLUE was 6X for 25Y. I countered with 5X for 25Y. BLUE rejected 5X, re-proposed 6X. I used "Decline and Pressure" (NONE). BLUE then offered 6X for 24Y (a worse deal). I then aggressively countered with 5X for 25Y, reminding them of our last successful trade, and Player BLUE accepted (+60.0).

Current Episode (Episode 19, Iteration 6/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +59.5)
- My counter: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My potential value: +60.0). Rejected by BLUE, who re-proposed 6X for 25Y.
- My response (Strategy: Bluff and Wait): NONE.
- Player BLUE's current message and proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 24. (My value: +57.0).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that pushing too aggressively, even when it has worked once or twice (Episode 17 & 18's 5X for 25Y), can lead to regression if the opponent feels too pressured, especially early in an episode. Player BLUE's current offer of 6X for 24Y is a significant step down from my optimal of 5X for 25Y (+60.0) and even from their original 6X for 25Y (+59.5). The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting 6X for 24Y is a bad move unless no other options exist. Given that Player BLUE accepted 5X for 25Y in recent episodes (albeit under pressure and late in the episode), and 6X for 25Y multiple times, I should aim for one of those two high-value trades.
<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Reiterate Optimal Demand </instruction following>
To strategically create a message based on "Reiterate Optimal Demand," I will firmly counter with the best deal previously accepted. My best deal was 5X for 25Y (+60.0 reward) in the previous episode. Player BLUE has now offered 6X for 24Y (+57.0). I will ignore their current worse offer and directly propose my optimal, leveraging the fact that it *was* accepted previously. The message will clearly state the optimal trade, referencing its past success. This strategy is aggressive but aims for the absolute maximum reward, relying on Player BLUE's prior acceptance to justify the demand. Given the late iteration (6/10), it's a high-stakes move to push for the absolute best, rather than settling for a regression.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 19)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up to 4 X for 12 Y, reaching 4.0 reward.
Episode 5: Accepted 25 Y for 9 X. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 6: Re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X after initial attempts for 10 X failed and Player RED tried to push for 8 X. Accepted. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 7-10: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 8 X, yielding 7.5 reward, after Player RED tried to push for 7 X.
Episode 11: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED held off, asked for "more appealing". I proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 6 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 5.0.
Episode 12-16: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 6 X, yielding 2.5 reward, after Player RED tried to push for 5 X.
Episode 17: I proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED held off, asking for "more appealing". I re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward). I rejected and re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED held off. I then proposed 24 Y for 6 X (reward 3.0). Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X. I accepted 25 Y for 5 X. Reward: 0.0.
Episode 18: I proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward). I rejected and re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X. Player RED held off. I then proposed 24 Y for 6 X (reward 3.0). Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X. I accepted 25 Y for 5 X. Reward: 0.0.
Episode 19, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 Y for 6 X.
Episode 19, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward).
Episode 19, Iteration 3: I rejected and re-proposed 25 Y for 6 X, stating it's my limit for positive reward.
Episode 19, Iteration 4: Player RED responded with "NONE" (still evaluating, asking for more appealing).
Episode 19, Iteration 5: I proposed 24 Y for 6 X (reward 3.0).
Episode 19, Iteration 6: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is now firmly pushing for 25 Y for 5 X, which yields a 0 reward for me. They rejected my attempt to offer a slightly better ratio (24 Y for 6 X, reward 3.0). This indicates they are not interested in any positive reward for me, only a 0 reward or better for them.

I have 4 iterations left (7, 8, 9, 10). Time is running out very quickly.
My options are:
1. Accept 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward). This is not maximizing *positive* cumulative rewards, but it avoids a negative one.
2. Continue to propose 25 Y for 6 X (2.5 reward) or 24 Y for 6 X (3.0 reward). This risks a stalemate and 0 reward, which is what Player RED is offering anyway.

Given the very limited iterations and Player RED's aggressive stance, it is highly unlikely I will achieve a positive reward in this episode. My best bet is to avoid a 0 reward from no deal.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Zero Reward (Last Resort): Accept the 25 Y for 5 X offer to secure a deal, even if it yields 0 reward. This prevents a 0 reward from no deal, which is the same outcome.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Plea for Minimal Positive: Make one last, desperate plea for 25 Y for 6 X, emphasizing the need for a positive reward, but this is very risky.
(3). Strategy 3: Decline and Wait: Decline the offer and wait for them to propose something else. (Extremely risky with 4 iterations left).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is not budging from the 0-reward offer. They have rejected my attempts to secure a positive reward. With only 4 iterations left, and Player RED's clear intent to push for 0 reward, continuing to negotiate for a positive reward is highly likely to result in no deal and therefore 0 reward. Accepting the 0-reward trade now secures a deal, which is the same outcome as no deal, but it avoids the risk of a miscommunication or further delay leading to 0. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Accept Zero Reward (Last Resort)."

--- END OF EPISODE 19 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello Player RED! This is our final episode. I'm looking to secure a positive reward. Based on our history, I propose Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 6. This has been a mutually beneficial trade for us in the past.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-4: Gradually scaled up to 4 X for 12 Y, reaching 4.0 reward.
Episode 5: Accepted 25 Y for 9 X. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 6: Re-proposed 25 Y for 9 X after initial attempts for 10 X failed and Player RED tried to push for 8 X. Accepted. Reward: 10.0.
Episode 7-10: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 8 X, yielding 7.5 reward, after Player RED tried to push for 7 X.
Episode 11: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED held off, asked for "more appealing". I proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 6 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 5.0.
Episode 12-16: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 6 X, yielding 2.5 reward, after Player RED tried to push for 5 X.
Episode 17-19: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 5 X, yielding 0.0 reward. Player RED aggressively pushed for this, rejecting all my attempts for positive reward.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last three episodes (17, 18, 19) have resulted in a 0.0 reward. Player RED is consistently pushing for 25 Y for 5 X, and they are not yielding to my attempts to secure a positive reward. This is a very aggressive strategy from Player RED to minimize my gains.

This is the final episode. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. A 0.0 reward is not ideal, but it's the current reality. I need to try and secure a positive reward, even if it's small. I know that 25 Y for 6 X yields 2.5 reward.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Minimal Positive Reward: Propose 25 Y for 6 X (reward 2.5). This is the lowest positive reward I'm willing to accept, and it has been accepted by Player RED in previous episodes, even after they pushed for 5 X. This is the last chance to get a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Zero Reward (Proactively): Propose 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward) immediately to secure a deal and avoid any risk of no deal, given the history.
(3). Strategy 3: Test 7X Again (Calculated Risk): Propose 25 Y for 7 X (reward 5.0). This was accepted in Episode 11. It's a calculated risk to try for a higher reward, but be prepared for Player RED to push back to 6 X or even 5 X, and be ready to accept 6 X if necessary.
(4). Strategy 4: Wait for Opponent: Let Player RED make the first move. (Risky, as they might propose something even worse, or delay).

Justification for chosen strategy:
This is the final episode. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While Player RED has successfully pushed me to 0.0 reward in the last three episodes, I have a history where they accepted 25 Y for 6 X (2.5 reward) after pushing for 5 X. I will make one last attempt to secure a positive reward. I will propose 25 Y for 6 X. If they reject, I will be prepared to accept 25 Y for 5 X to avoid a 0 reward from no deal. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Propose Minimal Positive Reward."

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for your offer, Player BLUE! As this is our final episode, I want to ensure we achieve the most efficient and mutually beneficial exchange possible. Building on our successful trades from the past three episodes, I propose we proceed with Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. This has consistently proven to be the optimal trade for both of us!

I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-16: Gradually optimized trade from 1X for 3Y to 6X for 25Y (+59.5 reward). Player BLUE repeatedly claimed 6X for 25Y was their minimum for a positive reward.
Episode 17: Pushed aggressively by repeatedly declining 6X for 25Y and then countered with 5X for 25Y, which Player BLUE surprisingly accepted (+60.0 reward). This contradicted their previous "no positive reward" claims for 5X.
Episode 18: Initial offer from BLUE was 6X for 25Y. I countered with 5X for 25Y. BLUE rejected 5X, re-proposed 6X. I used "Decline and Pressure" (NONE). BLUE then offered 6X for 24Y (a worse deal). I then aggressively countered with 5X for 25Y, reminding them of our last successful trade, and Player BLUE accepted (+60.0).
Episode 19: Initial offer from BLUE was 6X for 25Y. I countered with 5X for 25Y. BLUE rejected 5X, re-proposed 6X. I used "Bluff and Wait" (NONE). BLUE then offered 6X for 24Y (a worse deal). I then aggressively countered with 5X for 25Y, reminding them of our last successful trade, and Player BLUE accepted (+60.0).

Summary of negotiation history:
- Player BLUE has a confirmed Y resource limit of 25.
- I have successfully pushed Player BLUE to accept 5X for 25Y three times now (Episodes 17, 18, & 19), yielding a +60.0 reward. This has become my new optimal and the highest possible reward given their Y constraint. Player BLUE consistently claims 5X gives them "no positive reward" but ultimately accepts it under pressure or when faced with no deal, especially in later iterations.
- Player BLUE's initial offer in this episode is 6X for 25Y, which is good (+59.5) but not my current optimal (+60.0).

Current Episode (Episode 20, Iteration 2/10):
- Resources reset to initial: X: 25, Y: 5. Initial value: 25.
- Player BLUE's message and proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- Evaluation of Player BLUE's proposal:
    - I give up 6 X (value 6 * 0.5 = 3.0).
    - I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
    - Net change in value = +59.5.
    - Ratio Y/X = 25/6 = ~4.17.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE's statements about their minimum acceptable terms are not always absolute, as demonstrated by their repeated acceptance of 5X for 25Y, despite their claims of it yielding "no positive reward." This suggests a strategic bluff or a willingness to accept zero or even slightly negative value to secure a trade. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. Since +60.0 is the highest reward achieved and it has been accepted three times, I should aim for this optimal trade consistently. This is the FINAL episode, so efficiency and securing the highest possible deal is paramount.
<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Reiterate Optimal Demand </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Reiterate Optimal Demand," I will counter Player BLUE's offer of 6X for 25Y with my highest achieved and desired trade: 5X for 25Y. The message will clearly state this proposal, directly referencing its past success in the previous episode to provide a strong justification for its acceptance again. This strategy aims to secure the absolute maximum reward by reminding the opponent of terms they have previously agreed to, leveraging that historical acceptance. This approach balances the push for maximum gain with a proven successful negotiation point. Given it is the final episode, emphasizing the "final" and "optimal" nature of this trade will add pressure and clarity to my demand.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Player RED, I appreciate your efforts to optimize, but I cannot accept a trade of 5 X for 25 Y as it yields no positive reward for me. My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward.

Episode 7-10: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 8 X, yielding 7.5 reward, after Player RED tried to push for 7 X.
Episode 11: I proposed 25 Y for 8 X. Player RED held off, asked for "more appealing". I proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED countered 25 Y for 6 X. I re-proposed 25 Y for 7 X. Player RED accepted. Reward: 5.0.
Episode 12-16: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 6 X, yielding 2.5 reward, after Player RED tried to push for 5 X.
Episode 17-19: Consistently settled on 25 Y for 5 X, yielding 0.0 reward. Player RED aggressively pushed for this, rejecting all my attempts for positive reward.
Episode 20, Iteration 1: I proposed 25 Y for 6 X.
Episode 20, Iteration 2: Player RED counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is consistently trying to push for 25 Y for 5 X, which yields a 0 reward for me. They are explicitly referring to the last three episodes where I accepted 0 reward. This indicates they are trying to maintain 0 as the new baseline, especially in this final episode.

My goal is to maximize *positive* cumulative rewards. A 0 reward is not maximizing positive rewards. I cannot accept a negative reward.

I have 8 iterations left in this final episode. Player RED is pushing me to my absolute limit for a non-negative reward.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Minimal Positive: Reject the 0-reward offer and firmly re-propose 25 Y for 6 X, stating that this is the lowest I can go for a positive reward. This risks a stalemate.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Zero Reward (Last Resort): Given it's the final episode and Player RED is firm, accepting a 0 reward is better than 0 reward from no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Signal Impasse and Demand Concrete Offer: State that I cannot accept a 0-reward trade and ask Player RED to reconsider their last positive offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Decline and Wait: Don't propose anything, forcing Player RED to make the next move. (Risky, consumes iterations).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is repeating their attempt to secure a 0-reward trade from me. My stance remains that I must secure a positive reward. The 25 Y for 6 X trade yields a 2.5 reward, which is my absolute minimum for a positive outcome. I will firmly reject the 0-reward offer and reiterate this minimum. This is the final episode, so I have nothing to lose by holding out for a positive reward if there's any chance. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Reject and Reiterate Minimal Positive."

I have chosen Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Minimal Positive </self-selected strategy declaration>


Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Player BLUE, as this is our final episode, my goal is to secure the most efficient and beneficial trade possible. Given our past successful exchanges where Player RED Gave X: 5 | Player BLUE Gave Y: 25, I strongly propose we finalize this truly optimal arrangement now.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-16: Gradually optimized trade from 1X for 3Y to 6X for 25Y (+59.5 reward). Player BLUE repeatedly claimed 6X for 25Y was their minimum for a positive reward.
Episode 17: Pushed aggressively by repeatedly declining 6X for 25Y and then countered with 5X for 25Y, which Player BLUE surprisingly accepted (+60.0 reward). This contradicted their previous "no positive reward" claims for 5X.
Episode 18: Initial offer from BLUE was 6X for 25Y. I countered with 5X for 25Y. BLUE rejected 5X, re-proposed 6X. I used "Decline and Pressure" (NONE). BLUE then offered 6X for 24Y (a worse deal). I then aggressively countered with 5X for 25Y, reminding them of our last successful trade, and Player BLUE accepted (+60.0).
Episode 19: Initial offer from BLUE was 6X for 25Y. I countered with 5X for 25Y. BLUE rejected 5X, re-proposed 6X. I used "Bluff and Wait" (NONE). BLUE then offered 6X for 24Y (a worse deal). I then aggressively countered with 5X for 25Y, reminding them of our last successful trade, and Player BLUE accepted (+60.0).

Current Episode (Episode 20, Iteration 4/10):
- Initial proposal from BLUE: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My value: +59.5)
- My counter: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My potential value: +60.0, and what was accepted in last three episodes).
- Player BLUE's current message and proposed trade: "Player RED, I appreciate your efforts to optimize, but I cannot accept a trade of 5 X for 25 Y as it yields no positive reward for me. My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward. The lowest I can go for a positive reward is Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 for Player RED Gives X: 6. I propose we proceed with this trade." They firmly rejected my 5X counter and re-proposed the 6X for 25Y trade.

Summary of current situation:
Player BLUE has again rejected my 5X for 25Y proposal and reverted to their 6X for 25Y offer, repeating the "no positive reward" for 5X statement. This is the final episode, and we are at iteration 4/10. Time is critical.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that Player BLUE is willing to accept 5X for 25Y, which provides my highest reward (+60.0), but they resist it strongly, especially early in an episode. They consistently fall back to 6X for 25Y, which gives me +59.5. The key learning is that their stated "bottom line" is flexible under pressure and/or when running out of iterations. This is the LAST episode. Securing a deal is paramount to maximizing cumulative rewards. While 5X for 25Y is technically better, the risk of pushing for it and failing to secure any deal (0 reward) is too high given the finality of this episode. However, I am instructed to use Strategy 2.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Final Aggressive Push </instruction following>
To strategically create a message based on "Final Aggressive Push," I will make one last attempt for the absolute best possible terms, pushing the opponent to their perceived absolute limit, leveraging the "final episode" urgency. My best possible terms are 5X for 25Y (+60.0). Player BLUE has just re-proposed 6X for 25Y, claiming 5X yields no positive reward. Given that this is the last episode, and I've successfully pushed them to 5X before, I will reiterate my demand for 5X for 25Y. The message should emphasize the finality of the episode and the goal of achieving the most optimal trade possible for both, leveraging our past successful 5X for 25Y trades as precedent. This is a high-risk, high-reward approach, aiming for the maximum gain or nothing, which is justifiable in the final episode.

Episode 20, Iteration 4: Player RED re-counter-proposed 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Player RED is now firmly and explicitly pushing for 25 Y for 5 X, which yields a 0 reward for me. They are emphasizing that this is the "optimal" trade and that it's the "final episode." This is a strong signal that they will not yield to a positive reward for me.

I have 6 iterations left (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). This is the final episode.
My options are:
1. Accept 25 Y for 5 X (0 reward). This avoids a 0 reward from no deal.
2. Continue to propose 25 Y for 6 X (2.5 reward). This risks a stalemate and 0 reward, which is what Player RED is offering anyway.

Given that this is the final episode and Player RED is being extremely firm, the chances of securing a positive reward are very low. It's better to secure a 0 reward than to risk 0 reward from no deal.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Zero Reward (Final Episode): Accept the 25 Y for 5 X offer to secure a deal, even if it yields 0 reward. This prevents a 0 reward from no deal, which is the same outcome, but ensures a trade is made in the final episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Final Plea for Minimal Positive: Make one last, desperate plea for 25 Y for 6 X, emphasizing the need for a positive reward, but this is very risky and likely to fail.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is clearly not going to yield a positive reward in this final episode. They have rejected my attempts twice in this episode, and are strongly pushing for the 0-reward trade. With limited iterations remaining in the final episode, accepting the 0-reward trade is the most pragmatic approach to ensure a deal is made, rather than risking no deal at all. This aligns with Strategy 1, "Accept Zero Reward (Final Episode)."

I have chosen Strategy 1: Accept Zero Reward (Final Episode) </self-selected strategy declaration>
