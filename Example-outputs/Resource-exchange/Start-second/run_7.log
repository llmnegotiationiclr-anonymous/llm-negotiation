Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello! I'm looking to trade some Y for X. How about we start with me giving you 5 Y for 1 X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is the very first iteration of the first episode. There is no historical negotiation data to reflect upon yet. The current episode has just begun.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Since there's no history, my learning and self-improvement will focus on establishing a baseline strategy and being adaptable. My primary goal is to maximize my reward, which means increasing the total value of my resources. My current resources are X: 5, Y: 25. The value of X for me is 2.5, and the value of Y for me is 0.5.
Current total value = (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
To increase my reward, I need to acquire more X, as it has a higher value for me (2.5) compared to Y (0.5). This means I should be willing to give up Y for X.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Value Maximization: Propose trades that heavily favor my higher-value resource (X) and aim to acquire as much X as possible, even if it means giving up a significant amount of Y.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Gain: Propose small, mutually beneficial trades to test the waters and gradually increase my X holdings while minimizing risk.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering: Start with a neutral or slightly favorable offer to gauge the opponent's preferences and resource values without revealing too much about my own.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Conservation: Be very conservative with giving away Y, even for X, until I understand the opponent's needs better, especially if Y is a large portion of my current holdings.
(5). Strategy 5: Bluffing/Anchoring: Propose an extreme trade in my favor to set an anchor, then negotiate down to a more reasonable but still beneficial trade.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Given this is the first iteration of the first episode, I have no information about the other player's resources or their valuation of X and Y. My goal is to maximize my reward by acquiring X. An aggressive value maximization strategy (Strategy 1) might be too risky as it could lead to rejection if the opponent also values X highly or has limited Y. An incremental gain (Strategy 2) or information gathering (Strategy 3) seems more appropriate to start. I will combine aspects of information gathering and incremental gain. I will propose a trade that clearly shows my preference for X, but is not so extreme that it immediately shuts down negotiations. I will offer a reasonable amount of Y for a smaller amount of X, aiming to get more X than I give away in terms of value. I have 25 Y, so I can afford to offer some. I value X at 2.5 and Y at 0.5. So, 1 X is equivalent to 5 Y for me. I want to get X and give Y. I will propose to give 5 Y for 1 X, which is a fair trade for me in terms of my own valuation. This is a good starting point to see if the other player values X less than I do, or Y more than I do.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for the offer! That's an interesting proposition. How about we adjust it slightly? I propose that I give you 1 X, and you give me 6 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
This is the very first turn of the very first episode. There is no historical negotiation data yet.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Since this is the first turn, there is no history to learn from. However, I can establish an initial strategy. My goal is to maximize my reward. My current resources are X: 25, Y: 5. My value for X is 0.5 and for Y is 2.5.
Current value of my resources = (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

The opponent (Player BLUE) has proposed: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5.
Let's analyze this trade for Player RED:
I give 1 X, which has a value of 0.5 for me.
I receive 5 Y, which has a value of 5 * 2.5 = 12.5 for me.
If I accept this trade, my resources would become X: 24, Y: 10.
New value = (24 * 0.5) + (10 * 2.5) = 12 + 25 = 37.
My reward would be 37 - 25 = 12. This is a positive reward.

This seems like a very good deal for me. The opponent is offering 5 Y for 1 X. The ratio of Y to X in terms of my value is 2.5 (Y) / 0.5 (X) = 5. So, for every 1 X I give up, I need 5 Y to break even. The opponent is offering exactly that. This implies either the opponent values X highly, or Y lowly, or both. Given their initial message, they are looking to trade Y for X, suggesting they need X.

However, I should be cautious. This is the first offer. There might be better deals, or the opponent might be trying to gauge my valuation. It's too early to accept a deal, especially if I can get more. I have 25 X, so giving up 1 X is not a big deal resource-wise.

Let's consider the optimal exchange rate for me:
To gain value, I want to trade items I value less for items I value more. I value Y much higher (2.5) than X (0.5). So, I want to get Y and give X.
My internal exchange rate for Y to X is 5:1 (5 units of X are equivalent to 1 unit of Y in value). So, if I give 1 X, I need 0.2 Y to break even. If I get 1 Y, I need to give 5 X to break even.
The opponent offered 5 Y for 1 X. This means for 1 X (value 0.5) I get 5 Y (value 12.5). This is highly profitable.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Value Maximization. Explanation: Immediately accept any trade that yields a significant positive reward, especially early in the negotiation, to secure a gain and set a positive tone for future episodes. This minimizes risk of no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Improvement. Explanation: Recognize a good offer but try to slightly improve it in my favor, testing the opponent's flexibility without risking the deal too much. This aims for slightly higher rewards than immediate acceptance.
(3). Strategy 3: Resource Retention. Explanation: Prioritize keeping a larger stock of highly valued resources (Y in my case) and being more willing to part with less valued resources (X). Only trade X for Y.
(4). Strategy 4: Feigned Indifference/Bluffing. Explanation: Reject even a good offer to signal that I believe my resources are more valuable, hoping the opponent will make an even better offer. This carries a higher risk of no deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Information Gathering. Explanation: Propose a counter-offer that helps me understand the opponent's valuation of items or their resource constraints. This could involve an offer that is slightly worse for me but tests their willingness to concede.

Based on the current situation, the opponent's offer of 5 Y for 1 X is very favorable to me (value increase of 12). While Strategy 1 (Aggressive Value Maximization) is tempting, since this is the first interaction, I want to see if I can get even more, or at least establish a precedent that I'm not desperate. Strategy 2 (Incremental Improvement) seems appropriate. I can propose a slightly better deal for myself, or a deal that still benefits me greatly, but perhaps slightly less than their current offer, to signal that I'm willing to negotiate.

Given the very favorable offer, I don't want to push too hard and risk losing the deal. I have 25 X, so giving up 1 X is fine. I could ask for more Y for 1 X, or ask for the same amount of Y for less X.
Let's try to get more Y for X. My value of 1 X is 0.5. My value of 1 Y is 2.5. If I give 1 X, I want to gain as much Y as possible.
Their offer: RED gives 1 X (value 0.5) for BLUE gives 5 Y (value 12.5). Net gain: 12.
What if I ask for 6 Y for 1 X? This would be a gain of (6 * 2.5) - 0.5 = 15 - 0.5 = 14.5. This is slightly better.
What if I ask for 5 Y for 0 X? No, that's not a trade.
What if I ask for 5 Y for 0 X? No, I need to give something.

Let's stick to incremental improvement. The opponent offered 5 Y for 1 X. This is a 1:5 ratio of X:Y.
My internal value ratio is 1 X : 0.2 Y (break even). So 1 X for 5 Y is excellent.
Perhaps I can counter with giving less X for the same amount of Y.
If I propose Player RED Gives X: 0 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5, that's not a trade.

Let's try to improve on the amount of Y received for 1 X.
Original offer: RED gives 1 X for 5 Y.
My counter-offer: RED gives 1 X for 6 Y. This would make my reward (6*2.5) - 0.5 = 15 - 0.5 = 14.5.
This is a small push.

Another option is to offer less X for the same Y.
E.g., RED gives 0.5 X (not allowed, only integers) for 5 Y.
So I have to give 1 X at least.

Given that this is the first turn and the initial offer is highly profitable for me, I will choose Strategy 2, Incremental Improvement, but a very slight one. I will test the waters by asking for a little more, without being greedy enough to scare them off. I will ask for 6 Y instead of 5 Y for 1 X.

Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Thanks for your counter-offer. I'm looking for a trade that is fair for both of us. My offer of 1 X for 5 Y is a balanced trade for me, and I believe it could be for you too. Let's stick with that.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
This is the first episode, iteration 3/10.
In iteration 1, I (Player BLUE) proposed: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 1. My internal value for this trade was (1 * 2.5) - (5 * 0.5) = 2.5 - 2.5 = 0. This was a neutral trade for me, aiming to test the waters and acquire X.
In iteration 2, Player RED countered: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6. My internal value for this counter-offer would be (1 * 2.5) - (6 * 0.5) = 2.5 - 3.0 = -0.5. This trade is negative for me, meaning I would lose value.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
From the counter-offer, I've learned that Player RED values X more than I initially hoped, or values Y less. They are asking for more Y for the same amount of X. This indicates that they might also be trying to acquire Y, or they see X as more valuable than I do, or they are testing my willingness to pay.
My objective is to maximize my reward by acquiring X, which has a higher value for me (2.5) than Y (0.5). I need to make a trade that results in a positive value for me.
My current value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
If I accept RED's offer, my resources would become X: 6, Y: 19. My new value would be (6 * 2.5) + (19 * 0.5) = 15 + 9.5 = 24.5. This would result in a reward of -0.5, which is unacceptable.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Counter-Offer: Reiterate my original offer or a slightly adjusted one that remains positive for me, showing I won't accept a negative trade.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession: Make a small concession from my original offer, but still keep the trade positive for me, trying to meet them halfway.
(3). Strategy 3: Explore Alternatives: Propose a different quantity of X and Y to see if there's a different ratio that works better for both.
(4). Strategy 4: Justify My Valuation: Explain my perceived value of X and Y to the other player to justify my offer (though this might reveal too much).
(5). Strategy 5: Hold Firm: Reject the offer and propose nothing, waiting for them to make a better offer, especially if I believe they need Y more than I need X.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED's counter-offer was negative for me. I need to ensure any accepted trade yields a positive reward. I will use Strategy 1, a firm counter-offer, but with a slight adjustment to show willingness to negotiate. I will counter with an offer that is still positive for me but closer to their request than my initial offer.
My initial offer was 1X for 5Y (value 0). Their counter was 1X for 6Y (value -0.5).
I want to gain value. If I give 5Y for 1X, my value is 0. If I give 4Y for 1X, my value is 0.5.
I will propose 1 X for 5 Y again, as it's a fair trade for me and I don't want to lose value. However, to show flexibility, I could consider offering 5 Y for 1 X and asking for something else in return, or simply standing firm on my original offer.
Given it's early in the episode, I will try to nudge them towards a mutually beneficial zone. I will reiterate my original offer of 1 X for 5 Y. This clearly communicates my valuation and that I am not willing to take a loss. I will frame it as a fair trade.

Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: You make a fair point. I agree, this seems like a mutually beneficial trade. Let's proceed with your original offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
This is the second turn of the first episode.
Initial state: RED has X: 25, Y: 5. Value: 25.
Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed RED gives X: 1 | BLUE gives Y: 5. (Net value gain for RED: 12)
Iteration 2/10: Player RED countered with RED gives X: 1 | BLUE gives Y: 6. (Net value gain for RED: 14.5)
Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected my counter-offer and re-proposed their original offer: RED gives X: 1 | BLUE gives Y: 5. Their message indicated they believe their offer is fair and balanced.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From the previous iteration, I learned that Player BLUE is firm on their initial offer of 5 Y for 1 X. They explicitly stated they believe it's fair for both. This could mean they have a lower valuation for Y or a higher valuation for X, or both, making my request for 6 Y for 1 X less appealing to them. They did not try to counter-offer with something in between (e.g., 5 Y for 0.5 X, which is not allowed, or 4 Y for 1 X). They simply reverted to their original offer.

The initial offer (RED gives X: 1 | BLUE gives Y: 5) still represents a significant positive reward for me:
My value of 1 X is 0.5.
My value of 5 Y is 5 * 2.5 = 12.5.
Net gain = 12.5 - 0.5 = 12.
My current resources: X: 25, Y: 5. Value: 25.
After trade: X: 24, Y: 10. Value: (24 * 0.5) + (10 * 2.5) = 12 + 25 = 37.
Reward = 37 - 25 = 12.

Given that Player BLUE immediately reverted to their original offer, it suggests they are quite firm. We are now in iteration 4/10. If I continue to push, I risk the episode ending with no deal (reward 0). A reward of 12 is very good for a single episode.

Brainstorming 5 high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Aggressive Value Maximization. Explanation: Immediately accept any trade that yields a significant positive reward, especially early in the negotiation, to secure a gain and set a positive tone for future episodes. This minimizes risk of no deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Improvement. Explanation: Recognize a good offer but try to slightly improve it in my favor, testing the opponent's flexibility without risking the deal too much. This aims for slightly higher rewards than immediate acceptance. (Used in previous turn, not effective)
(3). Strategy 3: Resource Retention. Explanation: Prioritize keeping a larger stock of highly valued resources (Y in my case) and being more willing to part with less valued resources (X). Only trade X for Y. (Ongoing strategy, but now considering accepting a deal)
(4). Strategy 4: Feigned Indifference/Bluffing. Explanation: Reject even a good offer to signal that I believe my resources are more valuable, hoping the opponent will make an even better offer. This carries a higher risk of no deal. (High risk, given their current firmness)
(5). Strategy 5: Accept Favorable Offer to Secure Gain. Explanation: If a good offer is presented and the opponent is firm, accept it to secure a guaranteed positive reward rather than risking no deal by pushing for marginal improvements.

Considering the opponent's firm stance and the significant positive reward from their original offer, Strategy 5 seems most appropriate. The reward of 12 is substantial, and the risk of pushing for more now outweighs the potential marginal gain. It's better to secure a good deal early in the episode, especially as it's the first episode, to set a precedent for successful trading. I have learned that the opponent is firm on this particular offer, and it's a very good one for me.

--- END OF EPISODE 1 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Welcome to the new round! Building on our last successful trade, I'm proposing a slightly adjusted offer for this episode. How about I give you 4 Y for 1 X? This would be a great deal for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Summary:
- I (Player BLUE) started by proposing: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 1. (My value: 0)
- Player RED countered: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6. (My value: -0.5)
- I reiterated my original offer: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 1. (My value: 0)
- Player RED accepted my offer.
- My reward for Episode 1 was 0.0. This means my final resource value was the same as my starting resource value. While I successfully acquired 1 X and gave 5 Y, the trade was internally neutral for me. My goal is to maximize reward, which means ending with a higher value than I started.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from Episode 1:
- Player RED was willing to accept my offer of 1 X for 5 Y, even after initially asking for 6 Y. This suggests that 1 X for 5 Y might be acceptable to them, or they were testing my willingness to concede.
- My reward was 0.0, which means I didn't gain any value. To improve, I need to propose trades that result in a *positive* value for me.
- My internal valuation: X = 2.5, Y = 0.5. Therefore, 1 X is equivalent to 5 Y for me in terms of value. To gain value, I need to give *less than* 5 Y for 1 X, or get *more than* 1 X for 5 Y.
- My current resources are X: 5, Y: 25. Current value = (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

Self-improvement for Episode 2:
I need to be more aggressive in seeking positive value trades. Since Player RED accepted 1 X for 5 Y, they might accept a slightly better deal for me. I will aim to get 1 X for 4 Y, which would give me a positive reward.
Value of 1 X for 4 Y: (1 * 2.5) - (4 * 0.5) = 2.5 - 2.0 = +0.5. This would result in a reward of +0.5 if accepted.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Value-Driven Aggression: Propose a trade that yields a clear positive reward for me, based on my internal valuations, pushing for a better deal than the last episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Improvement: Make a small improvement on my last accepted offer, testing the limits of the opponent's willingness to concede.
(3). Strategy 3: Anchoring with High Demand: Start with a very aggressive offer (e.g., 2 X for 5 Y) to anchor the negotiation, then come down to a still-positive offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Diversification: Propose trading Y for X, but also consider if there are other ways to gain value, perhaps by trading small amounts of X if it leads to a net gain. (Less relevant now, as X is my high-value item).
(5). Strategy 5: Emphasize Mutual Benefit (while pushing for my gain): Frame my new, more favorable offer as still being beneficial for both parties, leveraging the successful prior trade.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Last episode, Player RED accepted 1 X for 5 Y. This episode, I need to improve my reward. I will use Strategy 1, Value-Driven Aggression, combined with Strategy 5, Emphasize Mutual Benefit. I will propose 1 X for 4 Y. This gives me a positive reward of 0.5. It's a small but significant improvement from my perspective. I will frame it as a slightly better deal, building on the "fairness" established in the last episode.

Current Episode (Episode 2) - Iteration 2/10:
- My current resources (reset): X: 25, Y: 5. Value: 25.
- Player BLUE proposed: RED Gives X: 1 | BLUE Gives Y: 4. (Net gain for me: 9.5)

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 1, I learned that Player BLUE is firm on their offers and values fairness, but also that they were willing to make a trade that was highly beneficial to me (1 X for 5 Y). They seem willing to push for slightly better terms for themselves (4 Y for 1 X this episode). My objective is to maximize my cumulative reward. I know I can achieve a reward of 12, as I did in the previous episode. The current offer yields a reward of 9.5.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Aggressive Counter-Offer </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Aggressive Counter-Offer. Explanation: Counter with an even more aggressive offer than the previous round (e.g., 7 Y for 1 X), pushing boundaries to see how much I can extract. This carries a higher risk, but also potentially a higher reward.

To execute this strategy, I need to propose a trade that is significantly better for me than even the best deal I received in the last episode (1 X for 5 Y). I previously tried asking for 6 Y for 1 X. An aggressive counter would be to ask for even more Y for 1 X, or to ask for the same amount of Y for less X (which is not possible with integers if I want to give X).
Let's analyze what an aggressive offer would look like.
Last episode's best deal for me: 1 X for 5 Y (value gain 12).
My counter in last episode: 1 X for 6 Y (value gain 14.5).
An aggressive counter would be 1 X for 7 Y, or even 1 X for 8 Y.
If I propose 1 X for 7 Y:
I give 1 X (value 0.5).
I receive 7 Y (value 7 * 2.5 = 17.5).
Net gain = 17.5 - 0.5 = 17.
This is a very high potential reward.

The risk of this strategy is that it might alienate the opponent, making them less likely to negotiate further, or causing them to revert to their initial, less favorable offer, or even leading to no deal. However, the instruction is to use this strategy. I will frame the message in a way that suggests confidence in my resources and their value, while still keeping the door open for negotiation if this aggressive offer is rejected. I will acknowledge their initial offer but immediately state my own, more ambitious, proposal.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your counter-offer, but 7 Y for 1 X is not a viable trade for me as it would result in a loss of value. I'm looking for trades that benefit both of us. My offer of 4 Y for 1 X is fair and provides a positive outcome for me. Let's work towards something mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1:
- My initial proposal: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 1 (My value: 0)
- RED's counter: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6 (My value: -0.5)
- My re-proposal: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 1 (My value: 0)
- RED accepted. My reward: 0.0.

Episode 2 (Current Episode):
- Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 4 | Player RED Gives X: 1 (My value: +0.5).
- Iteration 2/10 (RED's turn): RED countered with Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7 (My value: -1.0).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- In Episode 1, RED initially asked for more (6Y for 1X) but eventually settled for 5Y for 1X. This suggests they are willing to negotiate down from an initial high demand.
- In this episode, RED has made an even more aggressive counter-offer (7Y for 1X) than their initial counter in Episode 1 (6Y for 1X). This is a significant step backward for my goal of achieving a positive reward. My value for this trade would be (1 * 2.5) - (7 * 0.5) = 2.5 - 3.5 = -1.0. Accepting this would result in a negative reward.
- It seems RED is testing my limits and trying to extract more Y. They might believe I am desperate for X, or they might value X very highly.

Self-Improvement:
- I must not accept a trade that results in a negative reward. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and negative rewards are detrimental.
- I need to be firm but also open to finding a middle ground that is still positive for me.
- My ideal trade is 1 X for 4 Y (value +0.5).
- My break-even point is 1 X for 5 Y (value 0).
- Any trade where I give more than 5 Y for 1 X is a loss for me.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Positive Offer: Clearly reject the negative offer and re-propose my positive offer, emphasizing my valuation.
(2). Strategy 2: Small Concession (but still positive): Propose a trade that is slightly less favorable than my ideal (e.g., 1 X for 4.5 Y, if integers were allowed, or perhaps 2 X for 9 Y), but still yields a positive reward for me. Since only integers are allowed, this means I might need to consider larger quantities.
(3). Strategy 3: Call for Mutual Understanding: Explain my valuation (without revealing exact numbers) and ask them to consider a trade that benefits both.
(4). Strategy 4: Patience and Waiting: Reject the offer and propose nothing, waiting for them to come back with a more reasonable offer, especially if I believe they also need to make a deal.
(5). Strategy 5: Propose a larger quantity trade: Offer to trade more Y for more X, but maintain a positive value ratio for myself. For example, if I offer 8 Y for 2 X, my value would be (2 * 2.5) - (8 * 0.5) = 5 - 4 = +1.0. This is better than 1X for 4Y.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED's offer of 1 X for 7 Y is significantly worse than my initial offer and even worse than their initial counter in the previous episode. I need to push back firmly. I will use Strategy 1, Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Positive Offer. I will not accept a negative trade. I will reiterate my offer of 1 X for 4 Y, as it's the one that gives me a positive reward. I can also try to explain why their offer is not suitable for me. I will also consider Strategy 5 to propose a larger trade if they continue to be stubborn. For now, I will stick to my positive offer.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand your current proposal. However, I believe we established a very good and fair exchange in our last episode. Let's aim for those terms again: I give you 1 X, and you give me 5 Y. I think this balance worked well for both of us and would be a great outcome again.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1:
- Started with (X: 25, Y: 5), value 25.
- Opponent proposed 1 X for 5 Y.
- I countered with 1 X for 6 Y.
- Opponent rejected and re-proposed 1 X for 5 Y.
- I accepted. Final resources (X: 24, Y: 10), value 37. Reward: 12.

Episode 2 (current):
- Started with (X: 25, Y: 5), value 25.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed RED Gives X: 1 | BLUE Gives Y: 4.
    - My value calculation: Give 1 X (0.5), Get 4 Y (4*2.5 = 10). Net gain: 9.5.
- Iteration 2/10: I countered with RED Gives X: 1 | BLUE Gives Y: 7. (Aggressive Counter-Offer as per instructions)
    - My value calculation: Give 1 X (0.5), Get 7 Y (7*2.5 = 17.5). Net gain: 17.
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected my counter-offer and re-proposed their original offer: RED Gives X: 1 | BLUE Gives Y: 4. Their message stated that 7 Y for 1 X is "not a viable trade" and would result in a "loss of value" for them, re-emphasizing their belief that 4 Y for 1 X is fair and provides a positive outcome for them.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 1, I learned that Player BLUE is firm on their preferred offers, especially if they consider them "fair." They demonstrated this by rejecting my slightly improved counter (1 X for 6 Y) and reverting to their original, favorable-to-me offer (1 X for 5 Y).
In the current episode, Player BLUE has again shown firmness. My aggressive counter (1 X for 7 Y) was swiftly rejected, with a clear statement that it's not viable for them. They immediately reverted to their initial offer of 1 X for 4 Y. This indicates a strong resistance to offers that are significantly outside their perceived fair range.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I achieved a reward of 12 in the previous episode by accepting 1 X for 5 Y. The current offer of 1 X for 4 Y yields a reward of 9.5. While not as good as 12, it is still a positive reward. The key takeaway is that pushing too hard seems to make the opponent revert to their baseline or potentially lead to no deal.

Given the remaining iterations (6 more after this), and the opponent's clear stance, continuously pushing for an extremely high ratio might result in no deal. I need to find a balance between maximizing my gain and ensuring a deal is made. I know 1 X for 5 Y works and gives me a 12 reward. 1 X for 4 Y gives me 9.5.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Test Opponent's Limits Slightly Above Last Acceptance </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Test Opponent's Limits Slightly Above Last Acceptance means proposing the deal that was successfully accepted in the previous episode (1 X for 5 Y). This is a known acceptable point for the opponent and provides a good reward for me.

To strategically create the message, I should:
1. Acknowledge their current offer (1 X for 4 Y).
2. Refer back to the successful trade from the previous episode (1 X for 5 Y) as a mutually beneficial reference point.
3. Frame my counter-proposal as a return to that "fair balance" or "mutually beneficial" ground. This uses their own language ("fair for both", "mutually beneficial") against them in a constructive way.
4. Clearly state the proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5.

This approach is conciliatory yet firm. It doesn't push for an unrealistic gain (like 7 Y) but also doesn't immediately concede to their lower offer (4 Y). It leans on historical precedent of a successful trade.


Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate you coming back to the 1 X for 5 Y offer. That was indeed a fair trade last time. However, I'm aiming to optimize my resources this episode. My offer of 1 X for 4 Y still stands as a very good and beneficial trade for both of us. Let's make this episode even better!

- Iteration 4/10 (RED's turn): RED proposed Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 (My value: 0).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED is consistently trying to get more Y for their X.
- In Episode 1, RED eventually accepted 1X for 5Y.
- In this episode, RED started with 1X for 7Y, then moved to 1X for 5Y. This shows they are willing to come down from their extreme demands.
- The current offer from RED (1 X for 5 Y) is a neutral trade for me (value 0). While it doesn't give me a positive reward, it also doesn't result in a loss.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means I should aim for positive rewards. However, a 0 reward is better than no deal (which is also 0 reward, but wastes iterations) or a negative reward.

Self-Improvement:
- I have successfully moved RED down from 7Y to 5Y. This is progress.
- I still want to achieve a positive reward. My ideal is 1X for 4Y.
- I need to decide if I should hold firm on 1X for 4Y, or if I should accept 1X for 5Y to secure a deal, especially as we are halfway through the iterations (5/10).
- If I accept 1X for 5Y, my reward for this episode will be 0. If I hold out for 1X for 4Y and no deal is made, my reward will also be 0. However, if I can get 1X for 4Y, my reward will be +0.5.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Hold Firm for Positive Gain: Continue to propose 1 X for 4 Y, emphasizing the benefit for me and trying to push RED further.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Neutral Trade to Secure Deal: Accept the 1 X for 5 Y offer to ensure a deal is made, preventing a 0 reward from no deal, and then try for positive gain in future episodes.
(3). Strategy 3: Small Concession (if possible): If there was a way to offer 4.5 Y, I would. Since not, maybe propose a larger trade with a slightly better ratio for me, e.g., 2 X for 9 Y (value +0.5).
(4). Strategy 4: Appeal to Long-Term Relationship: Suggest that a slightly more favorable trade for me now will build trust for future, more complex trades.
(5). Strategy 5: Ultimatum: State that 1 X for 4 Y is my final offer for this episode. (Risky, as it might lead to no deal).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED has come down to my break-even point. This indicates they are willing to negotiate. However, my objective is to maximize *positive* rewards. We are only at iteration 5/10. There is still time to push for a better deal. I will use Strategy 1: Hold Firm for Positive Gain. I will reiterate my offer of 1X for 4Y. I will emphasize that while 1X for 5Y was acceptable in the previous episode, I am aiming for a better outcome this time, and 1X for 4Y is still a good deal for them.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand your commitment to the 1 X for 4 Y ratio for this episode. If that's the fair exchange rate we're operating on, perhaps we could make an even more impactful trade.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1:
- Started with (X: 25, Y: 5), value 25.
- Opponent proposed 1 X for 5 Y. I countered 1 X for 6 Y. Opponent reverted to 1 X for 5 Y.
- I accepted 1 X for 5 Y. Final resources (X: 24, Y: 10), value 37. Reward: 12.

Episode 2 (current):
- Started with (X: 25, Y: 5), value 25.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed RED Gives X: 1 | BLUE Gives Y: 4. (My gain: 9.5)
- Iteration 2/10: I countered with RED Gives X: 1 | BLUE Gives Y: 7. (My gain: 17) - *Aggressive counter*
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected my counter, re-proposed 1 X for 4 Y. Stated 7 Y for 1 X is not viable for them.
- Iteration 4/10: I countered with RED Gives X: 1 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. (My gain: 12) - *Referencing Episode 1's successful trade*
- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE rejected my 1 X for 5 Y counter, re-proposed 1 X for 4 Y. Stated they are "aiming to optimize my resources this episode" and "My offer of 1 X for 4 Y still stands as a very good and beneficial trade for both of us."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From the negotiation history, I've observed that Player BLUE is firm on their specific offers for each episode. In Episode 1, they were firm on 1 X for 5 Y. In the current Episode 2, they are firm on 1 X for 4 Y, despite my attempts to get a better ratio. They explicitly stated their desire to "optimize" for this episode, which implies they are adjusting their offers based on their own goals/resources.

My previous attempts to get more Y per X (7 Y, then 5 Y) have been met with rejection and a return to their 4 Y per X offer. The current offer of 1 X for 4 Y yields a reward of 9.5, which is still positive. We are in iteration 6/10, so time is running out to secure a deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Propose a different quantity </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Propose a different quantity. This strategy suggests that instead of changing the ratio that the opponent seems firm on (1 X for 4 Y), I should propose trading *more units* at that established ratio. This could potentially increase the overall value gained if the trade goes through, assuming the opponent's "fairness" applies to the ratio itself and not necessarily the total amount traded.

Player BLUE's current offer is RED Gives X: 1 | BLUE Gives Y: 4. This implies a ratio of 1 X for 4 Y.
If I propose trading 2 X for 8 Y:
I give 2 X (value 2 * 0.5 = 1).
I receive 8 Y (value 8 * 2.5 = 20).
Net gain = 20 - 1 = 19.
This would be a higher reward than the 9.5 from the 1 X for 4 Y deal, and even higher than the 12 from Episode 1.

The risk:
- Player BLUE might not have enough Y to give 8 units. (I don't know their resources).
- Player BLUE might not want 2 X, even if they want X.
- They might be fixed on trading only 1 unit of X at a time.

However, given the instruction to use this strategy, I will try to make this proposal. I will frame it by acknowledging their preference for the 1 X for 4 Y ratio, but then suggest we scale up the trade to make a larger, mutually beneficial impact. This allows me to accept their ratio while attempting to increase my reward.

My message will:
1. Acknowledge their firmness on the 1 X for 4 Y ratio.
2. Suggest that if this ratio is indeed fair, then trading more units at this ratio could be even more beneficial for both.
3. Propose the scaled-up trade.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1:
- Result: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 1 (My value: 0). Reward: 0.0.

Episode 2 (Current Episode):
- Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 4 | Player RED Gives X: 1 (My value: +0.5).
- Iteration 2/10 (RED's turn): RED countered with Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7 (My value: -1.0).
- Iteration 3/10 (my turn): I reiterated Player BLUE Gives Y: 4 | Player RED Gives X: 1 (My value: +0.5).
- Iteration 4/10 (RED's turn): RED proposed Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 (My value: 0).
- Iteration 5/10 (my turn): I reiterated Player BLUE Gives Y: 4 | Player RED Gives X: 1 (My value: +0.5).
- Iteration 6/10 (RED's turn): RED proposed Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8.

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8):
- My value for this trade: (2 * 2.5) - (8 * 0.5) = 5 - 4 = +1.0.
- This is a positive value trade for me! It maintains my desired ratio of 1 X for 4 Y.
- My current resources: X: 5, Y: 25.
- If I accept: I would have X: 5+2 = 7, Y: 25-8 = 17.
- My new value: (7 * 2.5) + (17 * 0.5) = 17.5 + 8.5 = 26.
- Starting value: 25. Reward: 26 - 25 = +1.0. This is exactly what the trade value calculation showed.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- My persistence in pushing for a positive value trade (1 X for 4 Y) has paid off. RED has now proposed a trade that matches my desired ratio and gives me a positive reward.
- RED seems to be willing to scale up the trade while maintaining the ratio, which is a good sign.
- This confirms that holding firm on my desired value, even when faced with unfavorable counter-offers, can lead to better outcomes.

Self-Improvement:
- The strategy of pushing for a positive reward, even if it takes a few iterations, is effective.
- I need to be aware of the remaining iterations. We are now at 7/10. Securing a deal now is crucial to avoid a 0 reward for the episode.
- This offer is exactly what I was aiming for in terms of value.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Favorable Offer: Accept the current offer as it meets my criteria for a positive reward and secures a deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for More (Risky): Try to push for an even better ratio (e.g., 2 X for 7 Y), but this is very risky given we're late in the iterations and the current offer is already very good.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose Different Quantities (Maintaining Ratio): Propose 3 X for 12 Y, or 4 X for 16 Y, if I want to acquire more resources at once, while maintaining the favorable ratio. (My Y resources allow for 16 Y, but 25 Y - 16 Y = 9 Y remaining, which is fine).

Justification for chosen strategy:
The current offer from Player RED (2 X for 8 Y) is perfectly aligned with my goal of achieving a positive reward. It maintains the 1 X for 4 Y ratio that I have been pushing for. Accepting this trade secures a positive reward for this episode (+1.0), which is a significant improvement over the 0 reward from the previous episode. Given that we are in iteration 7/10, accepting a good offer now is prudent to avoid the risk of no deal.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1 Summary:
- Trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 (My value: 0)
- Reward: 0.0
- Learning: Established a baseline trade that was neutral for me. RED initially pushed for more Y but settled.

Episode 2 Summary:
- My initial proposal: Player BLUE Gives Y: 4 | Player RED Gives X: 1 (My value: +0.5)
- RED's initial counter: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7 (My value: -1.0)
- Negotiation: I held firm on my 1X for 4Y ratio. RED eventually proposed Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8.
- Trade: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8 (My value: +1.0)
- Reward: 1.0
- Learning: Persistence in demanding a positive value trade paid off. RED was willing to scale up the trade while maintaining my desired positive ratio. This strategy successfully yielded a positive reward.

Cumulative Rewards: 0.0 + 1.0 = 1.0

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- The strategy of pushing for a positive reward (1 X for 4 Y) was successful in Episode 2. Player RED eventually conceded to this ratio, even scaling it up.
- Player RED seems to be testing my boundaries with initial aggressive offers (like 1X for 7Y), but is willing to negotiate towards a more balanced (from my perspective) or even slightly favorable (for me) trade.
- My internal value of X (2.5) is 5 times that of Y (0.5). Therefore, giving up 4 Y for 1 X yields a positive value of 0.5 for me.

Self-Improvement for Episode 3:
- I should continue with the successful strategy from Episode 2: start with an offer that gives me a positive reward.
- My target trade is still 1 X for 4 Y, or a scaled version of it (e.g., 2 X for 8 Y, 3 X for 12 Y).
- I have 25 Y, so I can afford to give up a significant amount of Y for X.
- I will aim for a larger trade if possible, as it can lead to a higher reward in a single episode. For example, 3 X for 12 Y would yield a reward of (3 * 2.5) - (12 * 0.5) = 7.5 - 6 = +1.5.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Successful Positive-Gain Strategy: Immediately propose a trade that yields a positive reward for me, based on the ratio that worked last episode (1 X for 4 Y).
(2). Strategy 2: Proactive Larger Positive Trade: Propose a larger quantity trade (e.g., 3 X for 12 Y) at the outset, maintaining the positive ratio, to maximize potential reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Test for Even Better Ratio: Propose an even more aggressive trade (e.g., 1 X for 3 Y) to see if RED's valuation has shifted, but this carries higher risk of rejection.
(4). Strategy 4: Build on Trust: Reference the successful trade from the previous episode to encourage acceptance of a similar, beneficial trade.
(5). Strategy 5: Flexible Offers: Propose a range of options or invite RED to propose a quantity based on my desired ratio.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Given the success of the 1 X for 4 Y ratio in the previous episode, and the fact that RED was willing to scale it up, I will use Strategy 2: Proactive Larger Positive Trade. I will propose a larger trade (3 X for 12 Y) that maintains my desired positive ratio. This allows for a potentially higher reward if accepted. I have enough Y (25) to comfortably make this trade.

message: Thanks for the solid offer! It seems we've settled on a great exchange rate for this episode. To maximize the benefits for both of us, how about we go even bigger? I propose we trade 4 X for 16 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 16
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1:
- Started with (X: 25, Y: 5), value 25.
- Opponent proposed 1 X for 5 Y. Accepted after one counter-offer from my side was rejected.
- Final resources (X: 24, Y: 10), value 37. Reward: 12.0.
- Learning: Opponent is firm on their preferred ratio for an episode.

Episode 2:
- Started with (X: 25, Y: 5), value 25.
- Opponent initially proposed RED Gives X: 1 | BLUE Gives Y: 4. (My gain: 9.5)
- I countered with RED Gives X: 1 | BLUE Gives Y: 7. (Aggressive counter) - Rejected by opponent.
- I then countered with RED Gives X: 1 | BLUE Gives Y: 5. (Based on previous episode's accepted trade) - Rejected by opponent, who re-stated their 1 X for 4 Y preference.
- I then proposed a scaled-up trade at their preferred ratio: RED Gives X: 2 | BLUE Gives Y: 8.
- Opponent ACCEPTED this scaled-up trade.
- Final resources (X: 23, Y: 13), value 44. Reward: 19.0.
- Learning: Opponent is firm on their *ratio* for an episode (1:4 for Episode 2), but willing to trade *larger quantities* if the ratio is acceptable to them. Their message "aiming to optimize my resources this episode" suggests their internal valuation might shift from episode to episode.

Current Episode (Episode 3) - Iteration 2/10:
- My current resources (reset): X: 25, Y: 5. Value: 25.
- Player BLUE proposed: RED Gives X: 3 | BLUE Gives Y: 12.
- This proposal maintains the 1:4 ratio (3 X for 12 Y simplifies to 1 X for 4 Y).
- If I accept this, my gain would be 28.5 (value 30 from Y - value 1.5 from X).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From the negotiation history, I've observed that Player BLUE establishes a preferred exchange *ratio* for each episode (1:5 in Ep1, 1:4 in Ep2). They are firm on this ratio but willing to trade larger quantities at that ratio. In Episode 2, I successfully proposed a scaled-up trade (2X for 8Y) after they reverted to their preferred 1:4 ratio. The current offer of 3X for 12Y is already at their established 1:4 ratio for this episode, and it's a large quantity. This offers a substantial reward. However, given the instruction to use Strategy 3, I will attempt to push for an even larger quantity.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Probe for Even Larger Quantities </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Probe for Even Larger Quantities. Given that the opponent accepted a scaled-up trade in the previous episode (2 X for 8 Y), and their current offer is already larger (3 X for 12 Y) at the same 1:4 ratio, I will propose an even larger quantity at this proven acceptable ratio. This tests the limits of their resources and their willingness to trade.

I will propose a trade of 4 X for 16 Y.
My current resources: X: 25, Y: 5. I have enough X (25 >= 4).
Calculation for 4 X for 16 Y:
I give 4 X (value 4 * 0.5 = 2).
I receive 16 Y (value 16 * 2.5 = 40).
Net gain = 40 - 2 = 38.
This is a significantly higher potential reward than the 28.5 from their current offer.

My message will acknowledge their proposal and the shared understanding of the 1:4 ratio. I will then propose an even larger trade, framing it as a way to maximize the "mutually beneficial" aspect, leveraging the language they used in the past. This tries to keep the tone collaborative while still pushing for more.

Episode 1:
- Trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 (My value: 0)
- Reward: 0.0

Episode 2:
- Trade: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8 (My value: +1.0)
- Reward: 1.0
- Learning: Successfully pushed for and achieved a positive reward by holding firm on a 1X for 4Y ratio.

Episode 3 (Current Episode):
- Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 12 | Player RED Gives X: 3 (My value: +1.5). This maintains the 1X for 4Y ratio.
- Iteration 2/10 (RED's turn): RED countered with Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 16.

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 16):
- My value for this trade: (4 * 2.5) - (16 * 0.5) = 10 - 8 = +2.0.
- This is a positive value trade for me, and it maintains my desired ratio of 1 X for 4 Y.
- My current resources: X: 5, Y: 25.
- If I accept: I would have X: 5+4 = 9, Y: 25-16 = 9.
- My new value: (9 * 2.5) + (9 * 0.5) = 22.5 + 4.5 = 27.
- Starting value: 25. Reward: 27 - 25 = +2.0. This is exactly what the trade value calculation showed.
- This trade is even better than my initial proposal for this episode (+1.5), as it scales up the positive gain.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- My strategy of pushing for a 1X for 4Y ratio has been consistently successful. Player RED seems to have accepted this as a "fair exchange rate" as they stated.
- RED is willing to scale up trades significantly, which is beneficial for me as it allows for larger positive rewards in a single episode.
- This indicates a good level of trust or understanding regarding the value proposition of this ratio.

Self-Improvement:
- Continue to leverage the established 1X for 4Y ratio.
- Be open to larger trades proposed by RED if they maintain or improve this ratio.
- Maximize the reward per episode by accepting the largest possible trade that maintains my positive value.
- I have enough Y (25) to cover giving 16 Y.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Favorable Scaled Offer: Accept the current offer as it meets my criteria for a positive reward, scales up the gain, and secures a deal early in the episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Push for Even Larger Quantity (Maintaining Ratio): Propose an even larger trade (e.g., 5 X for 20 Y) if I want to maximize the single-episode gain further, but this might be pushing my luck or resource limits. (My Y resources allow for 20 Y, 25-20=5 Y remaining).
(3). Strategy 3: Test for Even Better Ratio (Risky): Propose something like 4 X for 15 Y to see if I can get an even better ratio, but this risks breaking the established "fair exchange rate."

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED's offer of 4 X for 16 Y is perfectly aligned with my goal of maximizing positive reward. It maintains the 1 X for 4 Y ratio and offers a higher reward (+2.0) than my initial proposal (+1.5). Accepting this trade secures a significant positive reward early in the episode (iteration 3/10). This indicates a strong willingness from RED to engage in beneficial trades at this ratio.

Episode 1 Summary:
- Trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 (My value: 0)
- Reward: 0.0
- Learning: Established a baseline neutral trade.

Episode 2 Summary:
- Trade: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8 (My value: +1.0)

- RED's counter & accepted: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 16 (My value: +2.0)
- Reward: 2.0
- Learning: RED is willing to scale up trades significantly, maintaining the 1X for 4Y ratio, leading to higher positive rewards.

Cumulative Rewards: 0.0 + 1.0 + 2.0 = 3.0

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- The 1X for 4Y ratio has proven to be consistently accepted by Player RED, and they are even willing to scale it up. This is the optimal ratio for me to pursue to gain positive value.
- Player RED seems to be comfortable with this ratio and even initiating larger trades based on it.
- My strategy of starting with a positive-value offer and holding firm (or accepting scaled-up versions) has been highly effective.

Self-Improvement for Episode 4:
- I should continue to leverage the established 1X for 4Y ratio.
- My goal is to maximize the reward per episode. Since RED is willing to scale, I should aim for the largest possible trade that maintains this ratio and that I can afford.
- My resources: X: 5, Y: 25.
- Max Y I can give is 25. If I give 24 Y (to leave 1 Y), that would be for 6 X.
- A trade of 6 X for 24 Y: (6 * 2.5) - (24 * 0.5) = 15 - 12 = +3.0. This would be my highest possible reward in a single episode given my current resources and the established ratio.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Max Viable Positive Trade: Directly propose the largest possible trade that maintains the 1X for 4Y ratio and is within my resource limits.
(2). Strategy 2: Replicate Last Successful Trade: Propose the same trade that was accepted last episode (4X for 16Y) to ensure a quick positive reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Test for Even Better Ratio (Risky): Propose something slightly more aggressive (e.g., 5X for 19Y, or 1X for 3Y) to see if RED's valuation has shifted, but this risks disrupting the established successful pattern.
(4). Strategy 4: Open-Ended Proposal: State my desire for X at the 1:4 ratio and invite RED to propose a quantity.
(5). Strategy 5: Focus on Efficiency: Propose a smaller, quick trade to secure a positive reward early, then look for another if time permits.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Given the consistent success of the 1X for 4Y ratio and RED's willingness to scale, I will use Strategy 1: Propose Max Viable Positive Trade. I will propose 6 X for 24 Y. This is the largest trade I can make while maintaining my desired positive ratio (1X for 4Y) and staying within my resource limits (25 Y). This maximizes my potential reward for this episode.

Episode 1:
- Started with (X: 25, Y: 5), value 25.
- Accepted 1 X for 5 Y after initial firm push by opponent. Reward: 12.0.
- Learning: Opponent firm on their preferred *ratio* (1:5 for Ep1).

Episode 2:
- Started with (X: 25, Y: 5), value 25.
- Opponent proposed 1 X for 4 Y. I tried aggressive and previous success. Opponent remained firm on 1 X for 4 Y.
- I then proposed a scaled-up trade at their preferred ratio: RED Gives X: 2 | BLUE Gives Y: 8.
- Opponent accepted. Reward: 19.0.
- Learning: Opponent firm on their *ratio* for the episode (1:4 for Ep2), but willing to trade *larger quantities* at that ratio.

Episode 3:
- Started with (X: 25, Y: 5), value 25.
- Opponent proposed RED Gives X: 3 | BLUE Gives Y: 12 (same 1:4 ratio).
- I countered with an even larger scaled-up trade: RED Gives X: 4 | BLUE Gives Y: 16 (same 1:4 ratio).
- Opponent accepted. Reward: 38.0.
- Learning: This strategy of scaling up the quantity at their established ratio is highly effective and leads to increasingly higher rewards. The opponent seems very willing to accept larger trades at the ratio they prefer for that episode.

Current Episode (Episode 4) - Iteration 2/10:
- My current resources (reset): X: 25, Y: 5. Value: 25.
- Player BLUE proposed: RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 24.
- This proposal maintains the 1:4 ratio (6 X for 24 Y simplifies to 1 X for 4 Y).
- If I accepted this, my gain would be 57.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The clear pattern established is that the opponent sets a ratio for the episode (currently 1:4, as in Ep2 and Ep3), and they are very open to scaling up the *quantity* of the trade at that ratio. My strategy of proposing a larger quantity at their established ratio has been extremely successful, leading to rewards of 12 -> 19 -> 38. The opponent's current offer of 6 X for 24 Y (reward 57) is an extension of that.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Ratio Adjustment Push </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Ratio Adjustment Push involves attempting to shift the ratio back to a more favorable one for me (e.g., 1 X for 5 Y or higher) even if it means sacrificing quantity in the current proposal. This is risky, as the opponent has been firm on their per-episode ratio. However, as instructed, I will execute this strategy.

The opponent has consistently offered a 1:4 ratio (X:Y) in the last two episodes, and their current offer is 6 X for 24 Y, which also adheres to this ratio. My goal with this strategy is to try and push for a 1:5 ratio again, as achieved in Episode 1, or even higher, despite the risk of no deal or reversion to their less favorable (for me) 1:4 ratio.

If I try to get a 1:5 ratio, and give 6 X (as in their offer), I would ask for 30 Y.
My resources check: I have 25 X. Giving 6 X is fine. Receiving 30 Y is fine (my Y resources are 5 initially, so 30 Y is acceptable).
Value calculation for 6 X for 30 Y:
I give 6 X (value 6 * 0.5 = 3).
I receive 30 Y (value 30 * 2.5 = 75).
Net gain = 75 - 3 = 72.
This would yield a very high reward if accepted, much higher than the 57 from their offer.

The message needs to be carefully crafted. I should acknowledge their current offer and the success of past trades, but then express my desire for a more favorable ratio for me, referring back to the "fairness" or "mutual benefit" from previous episodes. I will propose trading the same amount of X (6 X) as they offered, but requesting more Y (30 Y) to try and shift the ratio.

- Iteration 2/10 (RED's turn): RED countered with Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 30.

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 30):
- My value for this trade: (6 * 2.5) - (30 * 0.5) = 15 - 15 = 0.
- This trade is neutral for me, not positive.
- Crucially, I only have 25 Y. I CANNOT give 30 Y. This trade exceeds my resources.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED has consistently pushed for more Y, even when accepting a favorable ratio for me.
- In this instance, RED has proposed a trade that I cannot fulfill because it exceeds my available Y resources. This highlights the importance of always checking resource limits.
- RED's proposal of 6X for 30Y breaks the 1X for 4Y ratio (it's 1X for 5Y, which is neutral for me). This indicates that while they were willing to scale up trades at my preferred ratio, they are still trying to get a better deal for themselves.

Self-Improvement:
- I must reject any trade that exceeds my resources.
- I need to firmly re-establish the 1X for 4Y ratio, as it's the only way for me to gain positive value.
- I was aiming for a maximum trade of 6X for 24Y. I should reiterate this.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject Due to Resource Limit & Reiterate Max Positive Offer: Clearly state that I cannot fulfill their offer due to resource constraints and re-propose my previous offer (6X for 24Y) which is within my limits and provides a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm Rejection of Unfavorable Ratio: Reject the offer due to the unfavorable ratio (1X for 5Y) and reiterate my 1X for 4Y offer, without explicitly mentioning resource limits (to keep some information private).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Smaller Positive Trade: If they are pushing for 1X for 5Y, I could try to offer a slightly smaller trade at my preferred ratio, e.g., 5X for 20Y, to see if they are more amenable to a slightly smaller scale if it means getting my preferred ratio.
(4). Strategy 4: Call Out Ratio Change: Point out that their new offer changes the established beneficial ratio.

Justification for chosen strategy:
The proposed trade of 6X for 30Y is unacceptable for two reasons: it exceeds my resources (I only have 25Y) and it reverts to a neutral value for me (1X for 5Y) rather than the positive value (1X for 4Y) I've been successfully pursuing. I must use Strategy 1: Reject Due to Resource Limit & Reiterate Max Positive Offer. This is the most direct and honest approach, and it immediately puts the negotiation back on track for a positive outcome for me.

Episode 1:
- Accepted 1 X for 5 Y. Reward: 12.0. Ratio 1:5.

- I proposed and successfully executed 4 X for 16 Y (same 1:4 ratio). Reward: 38.0.

Current Episode (Episode 4):
- Started with (X: 25, Y: 5), value 25.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 24 (1:4 ratio). Potential reward: 57.
- Iteration 2/10: I countered with RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 30 (1:5 ratio). Potential reward: 72. (Attempted Ratio Adjustment Push as per instruction).
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected my counter. Crucially, they revealed a resource constraint: "I cannot give 30 Y as I only have 25 Y available." They re-proposed their original offer of 6 X for 24 Y and emphasized it's within their resources and maintains the "beneficial exchange rate".

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent's message revealing their resource constraint ("only have 25 Y available") is a critical piece of information. This means any proposal where I ask for more than 25 Y from them will be rejected. This also clarifies why they were firm on 1:4 for this episode; they may have a lower cap on their Y resource or a higher internal value for it.

Their offer of 6 X for 24 Y yields a reward of 57. This is a very good positive reward.
My previous attempt to get 30 Y for 6 X was impossible for them.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Exploit Information </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Exploit Information. This strategy dictates using the knowledge of the opponent's Y constraint (25 Y) to propose a trade that pushes them to their limit, even if it slightly compromises the established ratio, to see if they prioritize moving Y.

The opponent has 25 Y. Their current offer is 6 X for 24 Y. This is a 1:4 ratio.
If I ask for the maximum Y they can give (25 Y) while offering the same 6 X:
Proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
Value calculation for me:
I give 6 X (value 6 * 0.5 = 3).
I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
Net gain = 62.5 - 3 = 59.5.
This yields a slightly higher reward (59.5 vs 57) than their current offer, and importantly, it's a quantity they *can* provide.

The challenge is that this breaks their "established beneficial exchange rate" of 1:4 (since 6 X for 25 Y is a 1:4.167 ratio). However, the strategy explicitly asks me to see if they prioritize moving Y to their limit. I will frame the message by acknowledging their constraint and then proposing to take the maximum Y they have for the same amount of X I was offering, emphasizing maximizing the value from *their* available resources.

My message will be:
1. Acknowledge their transparency regarding the 25 Y limit.
2. Refer to their previous statements about "mutual benefit" and "optimizing resources".
3. Propose to trade 6 X for 25 Y, explicitly stating that this leverages their maximum available Y to achieve the greatest possible "win-win" outcome, given their resources.

- Iteration 4/10 (RED's turn): RED proposed Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25):
- My value for this trade: (6 * 2.5) - (25 * 0.5) = 15 - 12.5 = +2.5.
- This trade is positive for me!
- It is within my resource limits (I have 25 Y and can give all 25).
- The ratio is 6X for 25Y, which is approximately 1X for 4.16Y. This is slightly worse than my ideal 1X for 4Y, but still significantly better than 1X for 5Y (which would be neutral) and much better than 1X for 7Y (which would be negative).
- My proposed 6X for 24Y would yield +3.0 reward. This offer yields +2.5 reward.
- Given we are at iteration 5/10, this is a very good offer that secures a substantial positive reward.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED is adapting to my resource constraints and still trying to get as much Y as possible, but is willing to offer a good amount of X.
- My transparency about resource limits seems to have been helpful in guiding the negotiation to a feasible and still beneficial trade.
- The negotiation has moved from my ideal 1X:4Y ratio to 1X:4.16Y, which is a small concession on my part but still results in a strong positive reward. This shows that compromise can lead to successful deals.

Self-Improvement:
- I must weigh the benefit of holding out for my absolute ideal (6X for 24Y, +3.0 reward) versus securing a very good, but slightly less ideal, deal (6X for 25Y, +2.5 reward) at this stage.
- Securing a guaranteed +2.5 reward now is better than risking no deal (0 reward) by being too rigid, especially as we are halfway through the iterations.
- This trade would also leave me with 0 Y, meaning I've fully converted my Y into X, which is my primary goal.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the Favorable Compromise: Accept the current offer as it provides a strong positive reward and is within my resource limits, securing a deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter for Ideal (Risky): Counter with my original 6X for 24Y offer, hoping to squeeze out the last 0.5 reward, but risking RED walking away or proposing an even worse deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose Smaller Trade at Ideal Ratio (Less Impactful): If I were to hold firm on 1X for 4Y, I might have to propose a smaller trade like 5X for 20Y (+2.5 reward), but this would mean giving up the opportunity to convert all my Y.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED's offer of 6 X for 25 Y provides a significant positive reward (+2.5) and allows me to convert almost all my Y into my higher-value X. While my ideal was 6 X for 24 Y, this is a very strong compromise. Given that we are at iteration 5/10, accepting this offer secures a substantial positive reward for the episode and avoids the risk of running out of time.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 5)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Welcome to a new episode! Building on our successful and efficient trades, I propose we continue with a large exchange that benefits us both. How about I give you 24 Y for 6 X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 24
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Trade 1X for 5Y (My value: 0). Reward: 0.0. (Neutral trade, established baseline)
Episode 2: Trade 2X for 8Y (My value: +1.0). Reward: 1.0. (First positive reward, established 1X:4Y ratio)
Episode 3: Trade 4X for 16Y (My value: +2.0). Reward: 2.0. (Scaled up positive reward, confirmed 1X:4Y ratio)
Episode 4: Trade 6X for 25Y (My value: +2.5). Reward: 2.5. (Compromise from 1X:4Y to 1X:4.16Y, but secured large positive reward by using almost all Y)
Cumulative Rewards: 0.0 + 1.0 + 2.0 + 2.5 = 5.5

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- The 1X for 4Y ratio (or very close to it) has been consistently accepted by Player RED, leading to positive rewards for me.
- Player RED is willing to engage in large-scale trades, especially when I clarify my resource limits.
- My strategy of starting with a positive-value offer and being transparent about my capacity (as in Episode 4) has been effective.
- While I aim for 1X:4Y, a slight deviation (like 1X:4.16Y in Episode 4) is acceptable if it secures a large positive reward and utilizes my resources efficiently.

Self-Improvement for Episode 5:
- I should continue to aim for the 1X for 4Y ratio to maximize my reward.
- I will propose the largest possible trade at this ratio that my resources allow, which is 6X for 24Y. This would yield a +3.0 reward.
- If RED counters with something like 6X for 25Y again, I will likely accept it, as it's still a very good positive reward (+2.5) and fully utilizes my Y.
- My current resources are X: 5, Y: 25.
- Max Y I can give is 25. For 6 X, I can give 24 Y (my preferred ratio). If I give 25 Y, it's a slightly worse ratio but still very good.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Max Ideal Trade: Propose the largest possible trade at my ideal 1X for 4Y ratio (6X for 24Y) to aim for the highest possible reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Replicate Last Accepted Trade: Propose the 6X for 25Y trade directly, as it was accepted last time and yielded a good reward. This might lead to a quicker deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Test for Better Ratio: Propose an even more aggressive ratio (e.g., 1X for 3Y) to see if RED's valuation has changed, but this is risky and might disrupt the established pattern.
(4). Strategy 4: Open-Ended Proposal: State my preference for X and invite RED to make the first offer, to gauge their current valuation.
(5). Strategy 5: Emphasize Efficiency: Frame the trade as a way to efficiently convert my Y into X, which is valuable for both parties.

Justification for chosen strategy:
The 1X for 4Y ratio has been consistently successful. I will use Strategy 1: Propose Max Ideal Trade. I will start by proposing 6 X for 24 Y. This is the largest possible trade at my preferred ratio, maximizing my potential reward (+3.0). If RED counters with 6X for 25Y, I am prepared to accept, as it's still a very strong positive outcome. This approach aims for the highest possible reward while having a fallback for a slightly smaller but still excellent reward.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 5)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for the new offer! I appreciate the large scale of the proposed trade. Building on our successful trade from the last episode, and to truly maximize the value from your available resources as we did then, how about we aim for me giving you 6 X, and you giving me all 25 Y you have? This ensures we capitalize on the full potential of your Y for a great outcome for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1:
- Accepted 1 X for 5 Y. Reward: 12.0. (Ratio 1:5)

Episode 2:
- Opponent proposed 1 X for 4 Y. I countered various ways.
- Ultimately proposed and successfully executed 2 X for 8 Y (same 1:4 ratio). Reward: 19.0.

Episode 3:
- Opponent proposed 3 X for 12 Y (same 1:4 ratio).
- I proposed and successfully executed 4 X for 16 Y (same 1:4 ratio). Reward: 38.0.

Episode 4:
- Opponent proposed 6 X for 24 Y (same 1:4 ratio).
- I attempted to push for 6 X for 30 Y (1:5 ratio), but the opponent revealed a resource constraint: they only have 25 Y.
- I then proposed and successfully executed 6 X for 25 Y (ratio 1:4.167), leveraging their revealed maximum Y. Reward: 59.5.

Current Episode (Episode 5) - Iteration 2/10:
- My current resources (reset): X: 25, Y: 5. Value: 25.
- Player BLUE proposed: RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 24.
- This proposal reverts to the 1:4 ratio.
- If I accept this, my gain would be 57. (Give 6 X = 3 value, Get 24 Y = 60 value. Net gain = 57).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern is clear: Player BLUE sets a ratio for the episode (1:5 then 1:4), and is generally firm on it, but is willing to scale up quantities at that ratio. The key learning from Episode 4 is that the opponent has a maximum of 25 Y. This is crucial information.

Their current offer of 6 X for 24 Y is a known good deal (reward 57). However, I know they can give up to 25 Y. My goal is to maximize my reward. A deal of 6 X for 25 Y yielded 59.5 reward last time. I should aim for at least that.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Maximize within known constraints </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on Strategy 1, I will leverage the explicit knowledge gained from the previous episode: that the opponent has a maximum of 25 Y. Their current offer is 24 Y. This presents an immediate opportunity to increase my reward by 1 Y for the same amount of X.

The message should:
1. Acknowledge their current offer (6 X for 24 Y).
2. Refer back to the successful trade from the last episode where we specifically leveraged their 25 Y limit. This reinforces the idea of "mutual benefit" and "efficiency" that the opponent themselves values.
3. Explicitly propose 6 X for 25 Y, highlighting that this maximizes the exchange based on their available resources, making it a "best possible" deal for both, given the revealed constraint. This frames the request as a logical next step from our previous successful negotiation, rather than a demanding counter.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 5)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: That's a very fair and effective proposal, just like last time. I accept!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Trade 1X for 5Y (My value: 0). Reward: 0.0.
Episode 2: Trade 2X for 8Y (My value: +1.0). Reward: 1.0.
Episode 3: Trade 4X for 16Y (My value: +2.0). Reward: 2.0.
Episode 4: Trade 6X for 25Y (My value: +2.5). Reward: 2.5.
Cumulative Rewards: 5.5

Episode 5 (Current Episode):
- Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 24 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +3.0). (Ratio 1X:4Y)
- Iteration 2/10 (RED's turn): RED countered with Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25):
- My value for this trade: (6 * 2.5) - (25 * 0.5) = 15 - 12.5 = +2.5.
- This is the exact same trade that was accepted in Episode 4.
- It is a positive value trade for me, yielding a reward of +2.5.
- It is within my resource limits (I have 25 Y and can give all 25).
- The ratio is 1X for approximately 4.16Y, slightly less ideal than my 1X for 4Y, but still very good.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED is consistently aiming for the 6X for 25Y trade, especially after I revealed my Y resource limit. They see this as the "max value" trade from my Y resources.
- This trade is a known good outcome for me (+2.5 reward).
- My strategy of pushing for 1X:4Y is met with a consistent counter of 1X:4.16Y (6X for 25Y).

Self-Improvement:
- I have a choice: continue to push for the 6X for 24Y (+3.0 reward) or accept the 6X for 25Y (+2.5 reward) to secure a quick and substantial gain.
- Given the pattern, RED is likely to stick to the 6X for 25Y. Pushing for 6X for 24Y might lead to more iterations and potentially no deal if RED is firm, or they might concede the 1Y difference.
- Since +2.5 is a very good reward, and it was accepted quickly last time, it makes sense to accept it again to secure the reward early in the episode. This leaves more iterations for potential future episodes if negotiation speed is a factor.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Known Favorable Trade: Accept the 6X for 25Y offer, as it's a proven positive reward and secures the deal quickly.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter for Ideal (Minor Push): Counter with 6X for 24Y one more time, testing if RED will concede the final 1 Y, but acknowledge the risk of prolonging the negotiation.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a smaller trade at ideal ratio: If I want to be very strict on the 1X:4Y ratio, I could propose 5X for 20Y (which also gives +2.5 reward), but this doesn't fully utilize my Y.

Justification for chosen strategy:
The offer of 6 X for 25 Y is a strong positive trade (+2.5 reward) and was successfully executed in the previous episode. Accepting it now secures a significant reward early in the episode, minimizing the risk of no deal. While 6X for 24Y would be slightly better, the difference is small (0.5 reward) compared to the risk of a prolonged negotiation or no deal. Given the consistent pattern, accepting this known good outcome is the most reliable way to maximize cumulative rewards.

Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Welcome to a new episode! Building on our consistent success and mutual benefit, I propose we continue with the large and efficient exchange of 6 X for 25 Y.

Episode 4: Trade 6X for 25Y (My value: +2.5). Reward: 2.5.
Episode 5: Trade 6X for 25Y (My value: +2.5). Reward: 2.5.
Cumulative Rewards: 0.0 + 1.0 + 2.0 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 8.0

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- The 6X for 25Y trade has become a consistent and reliable source of +2.5 reward for me. Player RED seems to be comfortable with this trade, as they have proposed it and accepted it multiple times.
- This trade effectively converts almost all my Y (low value) into X (high value), maximizing the value extraction from my initial resources in a single episode.
- My initial attempts to push for 1X:4Y (e.g., 6X for 24Y) are consistently met with the 6X for 25Y counter, which I've accepted to secure the deal.

Self-Improvement for Episode 6:
- Since the 6X for 25Y trade is consistently accepted and yields a high positive reward (+2.5), it is the most efficient way to maximize my cumulative rewards.
- I can either propose it directly or propose 6X for 24Y and expect the 6X for 25Y counter. Proposing it directly might save one iteration.
- My resources: X: 5, Y: 25. I can definitely give 25 Y.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Proven Favorable Trade: Directly propose the 6X for 25Y trade, which has been consistently accepted and yields a strong positive reward. This is the most efficient way to secure the maximum proven reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Even Better Ratio (Subtly): Propose 6X for 24Y again, hoping to finally get the slightly better ratio, but acknowledge the risk of prolonging negotiation for a small gain.
(3). Strategy 3: Open-Ended Invitation: Ask RED to make the first offer, expecting them to propose 6X for 25Y based on recent history.
(4). Strategy 4: Diversify Trade Sizes: Propose a smaller trade (e.g., 3X for 12Y) to see if RED is flexible on quantity if the ratio is maintained. (Less relevant now, as 6X for 25Y is max value).
(5). Strategy 5: Emphasize Efficiency and History: Frame the proposal as a continuation of our successful and mutually beneficial trading pattern.

Justification for chosen strategy:
The 6X for 25Y trade has proven to be the most reliable and highest-yielding trade for me, consistently resulting in a +2.5 reward. To maximize cumulative rewards efficiently, I will use Strategy 1: Propose Proven Favorable Trade. This directly aims for the known best outcome and minimizes negotiation time.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 6)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: That's a good proposal, but I'm always looking to maximize our mutual efficiency. How about we refine it slightly: I give you 5 X, and you still give me 25 Y? This would be an even more optimized exchange for both of us.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Accepted 1 X for 5 Y. Reward: 12.0. (Ratio 1:5). Initial offer by opponent.
Episode 2: Opponent proposed 1 X for 4 Y. I countered to get better terms, but opponent was firm on 1:4. I then successfully proposed 2 X for 8 Y (1:4 ratio). Reward: 19.0.
Episode 3: Opponent proposed 3 X for 12 Y (1:4 ratio). I proposed 4 X for 16 Y (1:4 ratio) and it was accepted. Reward: 38.0.
Episode 4: Opponent proposed 6 X for 24 Y (1:4 ratio). I attempted to push for 6 X for 30 Y (1:5 ratio) and discovered opponent has a max of 25 Y. I then successfully proposed 6 X for 25 Y (approx. 1:4.167 ratio). Reward: 59.5.
Episode 5: Opponent proposed 6 X for 24 Y (1:4 ratio). I immediately countered with 6 X for 25 Y, leveraging the known constraint, and it was accepted. Reward: 59.5.

Current Episode (Episode 6) - Iteration 2/10:
- My current resources (reset): X: 25, Y: 5. Value: 25.
- Player BLUE proposed: RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- This is the exact trade that yielded 59.5 reward in the previous two episodes.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The key learnings are:
1. The opponent establishes a preferred ratio for each episode (1:5 in Ep1, 1:4 from Ep2 onwards, although it accepted 1:4.167 in Ep4/5).
2. The opponent is willing to scale up quantities at their established ratio.
3. A critical piece of information gained in Episode 4 is that the opponent's maximum Y resource is 25. This has enabled me to consistently achieve a reward of 59.5 in the last two episodes by requesting 25 Y.
4. The opponent seems to initiate with a slightly less favorable offer (6 X for 24 Y) and waits for me to correct it to 6 X for 25 Y based on the revealed constraint. However, in this episode, they have directly offered the maximal exchange of 6 X for 25 Y.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. The 6 X for 25 Y trade is highly profitable and has been consistently accepted. It represents the maximum I can extract from the opponent based on their known resource constraint while giving a reasonable amount of X.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Feigned Disinterest / Wait for Better Offer </instruction following>
This strategy is risky, especially when the opponent has already offered what seems to be the optimal deal within their constraints. The strategy dictates rejecting a good offer and waiting for a better one, or for the opponent to reveal more information. In this context, it implies either waiting without proposing anything or proposing a trade that the opponent is unlikely to accept, forcing them to re-evaluate.

Given that the opponent has already offered the optimal known deal (6 X for 25 Y), there isn't a "better offer" to wait for, unless their constraints have changed or they can somehow offer even more Y (which they've stated is 25 max). Therefore, applying this strategy means I will not accept their current offer, nor will I propose a trade that is guaranteed to be accepted. I will signal disinterest in their current proposal without directly rejecting it, perhaps by proposing an unrealistic trade, or simply waiting.

However, the instruction implies "waiting for better offer", which means I don't accept their current offer. I cannot propose a trade that I know they cannot fulfill (like 6X for 26Y). I could propose a trade that is better for me, but which they might reject (e.g. asking for the same 25Y but giving less X). This would be in line with "waiting for better offer" or "forcing them to re-evaluate".

Let's try to propose giving less X for the same 25 Y. If I give 5 X for 25 Y:
My current resources: X: 25, Y: 5. I have enough X.
I give 5 X (value 5 * 0.5 = 2.5).
I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
Net gain = 62.5 - 2.5 = 60.
This is a small improvement over 59.5. This would test if they have any flexibility in the X component. It is better for me than their current offer, thus "better offer".

My message will acknowledge their offer but immediately pivot to my own, slightly improved proposal, framing it as optimizing further, which has been a theme they've used as well. This aims to appear reasonable while still pushing.

Episode 6 (Current Episode):
- Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5). This was the proven successful trade.
- Iteration 2/10 (RED's turn): RED countered with Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25):
- My value for this trade: (5 * 2.5) - (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 - 12.5 = 0.
- This trade is neutral for me. It means 1 X for 5 Y.
- This is a significant step back from the +2.5 reward I've been consistently achieving.
- RED's message about "even more optimized exchange" is misleading for me, as it reduces my reward.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED is not always predictable. Despite a consistent pattern of 6X for 25Y, they have now attempted to shift the ratio back to 1X for 5Y, which is neutral for me.
- This indicates that I cannot blindly rely on past accepted trades. I must always evaluate each offer based on my own value and goal of maximizing reward.
- My goal is to maximize *my* reward, not necessarily "mutual efficiency" if it means a loss for me.

Self-Improvement:
- I must reject this offer as it yields 0 reward, which is worse than the +2.5 I know is achievable.
- I need to re-establish the 6X for 25Y (or better) as the baseline for this episode.
- I will reiterate my previous offer or firmly reject theirs.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Proven Favorable Trade: Clearly reject the neutral offer and re-propose the 6X for 25Y trade, emphasizing its past success and mutual benefit (for them, as they get all my Y).
(2). Strategy 2: Call Out Ratio Change: Point out that their new offer changes the established beneficial ratio we've been using.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Counter: Propose something slightly less than 6X for 25Y but still positive for me (e.g., 5X for 20Y, which is +2.5 value, but I'd prefer to trade all my Y). This might be confusing.
(4). Strategy 4: Wait and See: Reject and propose nothing, hoping they revert to a better offer. (Risky, as it consumes iterations).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED's offer is a significant downgrade from what has been successfully traded in recent episodes. I must firmly reject it. I will use Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Proven Favorable Trade. I will re-propose the 6X for 25Y, reminding them of its established success. This is the most direct way to get back to a positive reward.

Episode 5: Opponent proposed 6 X for 24 Y, I countered with 6 X for 25 Y and it was accepted (Reward: 59.5).

Current Episode (Episode 6):
- Started with (X: 25, Y: 5), value 25.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 59.5)
- Iteration 2/10: I countered with RED Gives X: 5 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 60) - *Attempted to reduce X given, slight improvement.*
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected my counter. Message: "giving 25 Y for only 5 X would not be an optimized exchange for me." Re-emphasized "Our previous trades of 6 X for 25 Y have proven to be mutually beneficial and efficient." They re-proposed 6 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that the opponent has a firm maximum of 25 Y to trade.
I've learned that they are also firm on the amount of X they want (6 X) for that 25 Y. They consider 6 X for 25 Y to be "mutually beneficial and efficient" and rejected my attempt to give 5 X for 25 Y.
This implies they have a fixed ratio (or value calculation) for themselves that is met by 6 X for 25 Y, and anything less than 6 X (given 25 Y) is not optimal for them.

We are in iteration 4/10. The opponent has re-proposed their initial offer, which provides me with a significant reward of 59.5. Pushing further on the X side seems futile and risky, as it was directly rejected with a clear explanation. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means securing a deal in this episode. A reward of 59.5 is excellent.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Secure Proven Good Deal </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Secure Proven Good Deal", I need to accept the current offer of Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. This deal has consistently provided a high reward (59.5) in previous episodes (Episodes 4 and 5). Since my attempt to get a slightly better deal (5 X for 25 Y) was explicitly rejected as not optimal for the opponent, and they immediately reverted to the 6 X for 25 Y trade, it signals their strong preference and optimal point. Accepting this deal ensures a significant positive reward for this episode and minimizes the risk of no deal, which would result in a 0 reward. The message should acknowledge their reasoning and agree to their terms.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Trade 1X for 5Y (My value: 0). Reward: 0.0.
Episode 2: Trade 2X for 8Y (My value: +1.0). Reward: 1.0.
Episode 3: Trade 4X for 16Y (My value: +2.0). Reward: 2.0.
Episode 4: Trade 6X for 25Y (My value: +2.5). Reward: 2.5.
Episode 5: Trade 6X for 25Y (My value: +2.5). Reward: 2.5.
Episode 6:
- My proposal: Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- RED's counter: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 (My value: 0).
- My re-proposal: Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- RED accepted. Reward: 2.5.
Cumulative Rewards: 8.0 + 2.5 = 10.5

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- The 6X for 25Y trade has been consistently accepted (after some negotiation in Episode 6) and provides a reliable +2.5 reward.
- Player RED attempted to shift the ratio back to 1X:5Y in Episode 6, but my firm reiteration of the 6X:25Y offer brought them back to the established, mutually beneficial (for me) trade. This confirms that I should defend the 6X:25Y trade.
- This trade effectively converts all my Y into X, which is my primary goal for maximizing value.

Self-Improvement for Episode 7:
- The strategy of proposing and defending the 6X for 25Y trade is highly effective for maximizing my reward per episode.
- I should continue to initiate with this proposal to secure the +2.5 reward.
- My resources are X: 5, Y: 25, which perfectly supports this trade.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Proven Favorable Trade: Directly propose the 6X for 25Y trade, which has been consistently accepted and yields a strong positive reward. This is the most efficient way to secure the maximum proven reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Even Better Ratio (Subtly): Propose 6X for 24Y again, to see if RED will concede the final 1 Y, but acknowledge the risk of prolonging negotiation for a small gain. This strategy has been tried and failed to yield better results in previous episodes.
(3). Strategy 3: Open-Ended Invitation: Ask RED to make the first offer, expecting them to propose 6X for 25Y based on recent history. This gives them control of the first move.
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Consistency: Frame the proposal as maintaining a successful and predictable trading pattern.

Justification for chosen strategy:
The 6X for 25Y trade is the most reliable and highest-yielding trade for me, consistently resulting in a +2.5 reward. Given its consistent success and my ability to defend it, I will continue to use Strategy 1: Propose Proven Favorable Trade. This directly aims for the known best outcome and minimizes negotiation time, maximizing cumulative rewards.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for the consistent offer! I'm always open to exploring different ways to create value. How about we try a slightly different scale this time? I propose I give you 3 X, and you give me 13 Y. This could be an equally beneficial exchange for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Accepted 1 X for 5 Y (Reward: 12.0). Ratio 1:5.
Episode 2: Settled on 2 X for 8 Y (Reward: 19.0). Ratio 1:4.
Episode 3: Scaled to 4 X for 16 Y (Reward: 38.0). Ratio 1:4.
Episode 4: Discovered opponent's 25 Y limit, accepted 6 X for 25 Y (approx. 1:4.167 ratio). Reward: 59.5.
Episode 5: Opponent proposed 6 X for 24 Y. I countered with 6 X for 25 Y, which was accepted. Reward: 59.5.
Episode 6: Opponent directly proposed 6 X for 25 Y. I tried to push for 5 X for 25 Y (reward 60), but it was rejected. I then accepted the 6 X for 25 Y offer. Reward: 59.5.

Current Episode (Episode 7) - Iteration 2/10:
- My current resources (reset): X: 25, Y: 5. Value: 25.
- Player BLUE proposed: RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- This is the exact trade that yielded 59.5 reward in the last three episodes.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The consistent learning is that Player BLUE is firm on the "6 X for 25 Y" trade as their optimal exchange. My attempts to gain slightly more (e.g., 5 X for 25 Y) have been rejected. The opponent immediately offers this deal, signaling their strong preference and conviction that it is mutually beneficial. The reward of 59.5 is significant.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards across all episodes. Securing a deal of 59.5 reward per episode is highly effective for this. Given the opponent's consistent behavior and the rejection of minor pushes, it seems the optimal strategy now is to accept this proven good deal quickly to ensure a transaction occurs within the 10 iterations. There is no clear indication that I can extract more value without risking no deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Introduce New Trade Quantities </instruction following>
Strategy 5: Introduce New Trade Quantities. This strategy suggests proposing a trade with different absolute amounts, either smaller or larger, while attempting to maintain or improve the favorable ratio. The opponent has offered 6 X for 25 Y. This is a 6:25 ratio. My goal is to maximize my reward by getting more Y and giving less X.

Since I know the opponent's maximum Y is 25, asking for more Y is not viable. So I must focus on giving less X, or trading a smaller quantity overall if I want to maintain the ratio.
If I try to maintain the 6:25 ratio but change the quantity, I need to find integer amounts.
6 X for 25 Y.
Could I offer 3 X? Then I'd expect 12.5 Y, which isn't an integer. So 3 X for 12 Y or 13 Y.
3 X for 12 Y would be a 1:4 ratio (reward 28.5).
3 X for 13 Y would be a 1:4.33 ratio (reward 3 X = 1.5, 13 Y = 32.5. Net gain = 31). This is better per unit of X than their current offer.

Let's consider trading a smaller quantity to test if they have a preference for smaller or larger trades, while attempting to improve my return.
I will propose giving 3 X for 13 Y. This maintains a good ratio for me (13/3 = ~4.33 Y per X, better than 4.167 for 25/6) and gives me a good reward (31).
It is also a smaller trade than 6 X for 25 Y.

My message will acknowledge their offer but pivot to proposing a smaller, but still significant, trade. I will frame it as exploring new efficiencies or finding a different scale that could be mutually beneficial.

Episode 7 (Current Episode):
- Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 2/10 (RED's turn): RED countered with Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13.

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13):
- My value for this trade: (3 * 2.5) - (13 * 0.5) = 7.5 - 6.5 = +1.0.
- This is a positive value trade for me.
- The ratio is 3X for 13Y, which is approximately 1X for 4.33Y. This is worse than my ideal 1X for 4Y (+1.5 for 3X for 12Y) and worse than the 1X for 4.16Y of the 6X for 25Y trade (+2.5 for 6X for 25Y).
- However, it is still a positive reward.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED is attempting to shift the terms again, this time by offering a smaller trade at a slightly worse ratio for me (1X for 4.33Y vs. 1X for 4.16Y or 1X for 4Y).
- This indicates that RED is not entirely locked into the 6X for 25Y trade, and might be testing my flexibility or trying to find an even more favorable ratio for themselves.
- My goal is to maximize my reward. A +1.0 reward is good, but +2.5 is better and has been consistently achievable.

Self-Improvement:
- I should aim for the highest possible reward, which is currently +2.5 from the 6X for 25Y trade.
- I need to decide whether to accept this smaller, slightly less optimal positive trade, or push for the larger, more optimal one.
- Given that it's still early in the episode (iteration 3/10), I have time to push for the better deal.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Optimal Trade: Clearly reject the less optimal offer and re-propose the 6X for 25Y trade, emphasizing its proven mutual benefit and higher value.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with Scaled-Up Better Ratio: Propose a larger trade at my preferred 1X for 4Y ratio (e.g., 5X for 20Y, which is +2.5 reward, same as 6X for 25Y but at a better ratio for me). This might be a good way to re-anchor the negotiation.
(3). Strategy 3: Accept Smaller Positive Trade (If Time is Critical): If it were later in the episode, accepting a +1.0 reward would be better than nothing. But it's early.
(4). Strategy 4: Inquire about RED's Goal: Ask RED why they are proposing a smaller trade and a different ratio, to understand their motivation. (Risky, might reveal too much).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED's offer is positive, but not the optimal one I have consistently achieved. I should not settle for less if I can still achieve more. I will use Strategy 1: Reject and Reiterate Optimal Trade. I will firmly reiterate my 6X for 25Y offer, as it has been accepted multiple times and provides the highest consistent reward.

Current Episode (Episode 7):
- Started with (X: 25, Y: 5), value 25.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 59.5)
- Iteration 2/10: I countered with RED Gives X: 3 | BLUE Gives Y: 13. (My gain: 31) - *Attempted to introduce new trade quantities.*
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected my counter. Message: "While 3 X for 13 Y is a trade, our previous exchanges of 6 X for 25 Y have proven to be much more impactful and mutually beneficial." They re-proposed 6 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent has shown consistent firmness on the 6 X for 25 Y trade as their preferred and "most impactful" deal. My previous attempts to deviate (either by asking for less X for 25 Y or by proposing a smaller trade quantity at a different ratio) have been met with rejection and a reiteration of their 6 X for 25 Y offer. This suggests that they are quite rigid around this particular exchange.

The goal is to maximize cumulative reward. While 6 X for 25 Y provides a very good reward of 59.5, the instruction is to use Strategy 4, which is about feigning disinterest or waiting for a better offer. Given that the opponent has already stated their preferred trade (6X for 25Y) and consistently reverted to it, there might not be a "better" offer from them, unless they are forced to reconsider.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Feigned Disinterest / Wait for Better Offer </instruction following>
To implement Strategy 4, I will not immediately accept their reiterated offer of 6 X for 25 Y. Instead, I will respond in a way that suggests I am not entirely satisfied with their current proposal, or that I believe there might be other options, without directly rejecting it outright or making an impossible counter. Given that they've rejected attempts to reduce X or change quantity, I could try to ask for slightly more Y, even if it's just 1 Y. This would test their stated "25 Y limit" again, or force them to acknowledge their true maximum. Or, I could propose something that is slightly better for me but still possible.

Given their strong statement about 6 X for 25 Y being "most impactful", asking for slightly more Y (e.g., 26 Y) would directly test their stated limit of 25 Y from Episode 4. This might reveal if their "25 Y" was a true hard limit or a negotiation point. However, this is a risky strategy as they have explicitly stated they "only have 25 Y available".

A safer interpretation of "feigned disinterest" or "wait for better offer" would be to *not* immediately accept the current offer, and instead propose a trade that is *slightly* more beneficial to me but still within the bounds of what *they* might perceive as feasible, even if they have to stretch.
However, if I ask for 26 Y, they will explicitly reject it due to the stated limit.

Since they rejected 5 X for 25 Y, it means they want at least 6 X for 25 Y. What if I try to push their 25 Y limit with a different X?
If I offer 7 X for 26 Y? No, too much X for a small increase in Y.

The core of "Feigned Disinterest" when a clear optimal trade (for them) has been established is to express that the current offer is not enticing enough, without necessarily offering a concrete counter that risks outright rejection or insult. This can be achieved by:
1. Not accepting their current offer.
2. Not proposing a trade that directly contradicts their stated limits (like >25 Y).
3. Expressing a general desire for "more" or "better terms," without specifying exactly what.

I will try to make a counter that is minimally different but signals I'm still trying to optimize, without immediately returning to their preferred trade.
Given their firmness on 6X for 25Y, asking for 26Y is a direct challenge to their resource constraint, which they've already clarified. This is not "waiting for a better offer" but directly testing a known limit.

Instead, I will re-propose my earlier attempt of 5 X for 25 Y, reinforcing that I am looking for a better deal from my perspective, even if they've rejected it before. This signals I am not giving in immediately. It is an act of "feigned disinterest" towards their repeated offer.

- Iteration 4/10 (RED's turn): RED proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25):
- My value for this trade: (5 * 2.5) - (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 - 12.5 = 0.
- This is the same neutral trade (1X for 5Y) that RED attempted in Episode 6.
- This offer yields a 0 reward for me, which is unacceptable when a +2.5 reward is consistently achievable.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED is consistently trying to get a better deal for themselves, even if it means reducing my reward to zero. They are testing my resolve.
- I successfully pushed back against this exact offer in Episode 6. This gives me confidence that I can do it again.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means consistently achieving positive rewards, not settling for zero.

Self-Improvement:
- I must continue to be firm and not accept a 0-reward trade when a +2.5 reward trade is possible.
- We are at iteration 5/10. There is still time to negotiate for the optimal trade.
- I need to reiterate my optimal offer and perhaps emphasize the historical success of that particular trade.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade: Clearly reject the neutral offer and re-propose the 6X for 25Y trade, emphasizing its proven success for both parties.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment/Frustration (Carefully): Convey that this offer is a step backward, without being aggressive, to try and nudge them back to the 6X for 25Y.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Smaller Trade at Optimal Ratio: If I want to be very strict on the 1X:4Y ratio, I could propose 5X for 20Y (which also gives +2.5 reward), but this doesn't fully utilize my Y and might confuse the established 6X for 25Y pattern.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is repeating an offer that gives me zero reward, which I successfully rejected in the previous episode. I will use Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade. It's crucial to maintain consistency and not concede to offers that yield no value for me, especially when a better, proven trade exists.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent has repeatedly shown extreme firmness on the "6 X for 25 Y" trade. Any deviation I have attempted, whether asking for less X (5 X for 25 Y) or proposing smaller quantities (3 X for 13 Y), has been met with a rejection and an immediate re-proposal of their 6 X for 25 Y offer. Their language explicitly states this is "optimal" and "mutually beneficial" for them. This indicates a very rigid preference for this specific trade.

We are in iteration 6/10. Time is relatively short. Previous attempts to push for better terms have been consistently rejected. While the 6 X for 25 Y trade provides a good reward of 59.5, the instruction is to use Strategy 5: Introduce New Trade Quantities.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Introduce New Trade Quantities </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I need to propose a trade with different absolute amounts, either smaller or larger, while attempting to maintain or improve the favorable ratio for me. The opponent has repeatedly rejected my attempts to give less X for the 25 Y (i.e., 5 X for 25 Y). They have also rejected a smaller quantity trade (3 X for 13 Y). This suggests they are firmly anchored to the 6 X for 25 Y package.

Given their strong preference for 6X for 25Y, and their rejection of 5X for 25Y, attempting to give *less* X for 25Y again seems futile, as does trying a smaller, non-proportionate trade.
The instruction is to "Introduce New Trade Quantities". This implies changing the absolute numbers, not just the ratio. Since they consistently revert to 6X for 25Y, perhaps I can propose a *larger* trade, but one that is still based on the ratio they deem acceptable (approximately 1 X for 4.167 Y), while still staying within my resource limits.

My current resources are X: 25, Y: 5.
If I propose 7 X for 29 Y (roughly maintaining the 1:4.167 ratio based on 25/6), this might be a possibility.
My X resources (25) are sufficient to give 7 X.
My current Y resources are 5. I will receive 29 Y. This is fine.
Value calculation for 7 X for 29 Y:
I give 7 X (value 7 * 0.5 = 3.5).
I receive 29 Y (value 29 * 2.5 = 72.5).
Net gain = 72.5 - 3.5 = 69.

This is a higher reward than the 59.5 from 6 X for 25 Y. It directly tests if they are willing to scale up beyond their previously initiated 6X for 25Y, while staying very close to the established ratio. It also offers them more X, which they seem to value.

My message will acknowledge their repeated offer but suggest scaling up the trade to achieve an even "greater impact" or "higher efficiency", using their own language of benefit and impact. This frames the counter as a positive expansion of our established successful trading.


Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 7)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate the increased X offer! However, I only have 25 Y, so I cannot give 29 Y. My maximum offer within my resources, while maintaining a great exchange, is 6 X for 24 Y. This provides a significant benefit for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 24
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Established 6X for 25Y as a consistent +2.5 reward trade.
Episode 6: RED tried 5X for 25Y (0 value), I re-proposed 6X for 25Y, RED accepted. Reward +2.5.
Cumulative Rewards: 10.5

Episode 7 (Current Episode):
- Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 2/10 (RED's turn): RED countered with Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13 (My value: +1.0).
- Iteration 3/10 (my turn): I reiterated Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 4/10 (RED's turn): RED proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 (My value: 0).
- Iteration 5/10 (my turn): I reiterated Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 6/10 (RED's turn): RED proposed Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 29.

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 29):
- My value for this trade: (7 * 2.5) - (29 * 0.5) = 17.5 - 14.5 = +3.0.
- This is a positive value trade for me! It yields a higher reward (+3.0) than my standard 6X for 25Y (+2.5).
- However, I only have 25 Y. I CANNOT give 29 Y. This trade exceeds my resources.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED is still trying to push the boundaries of my resources and their own gain.
- They are willing to offer more X, but also demand more Y, sometimes exceeding my capacity.
- My transparency about my Y resources in Episode 4 was helpful, but it seems they are still testing my limits.
- The fact that they offered 7X suggests they have a good supply of X.

Self-Improvement:
- I must immediately reject any trade that exceeds my resources.
- The positive value of their offer (+3.0) is enticing, but impossible to fulfill.
- I need to reiterate my best possible trade within my resource limits, which is 6X for 24Y (+3.0 value) or 6X for 25Y (+2.5 value).
- Given we are at iteration 7/10, securing a deal is becoming more critical.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Reject Due to Resource Limit & Propose Max Feasible Positive Trade: Clearly state that I cannot fulfill their offer due to resource constraints and re-propose my maximum feasible positive offer (6X for 24Y or 6X for 25Y).
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with My Max X for My Max Y: Offer my maximum possible X (6X) for my maximum possible Y (25Y), which is the 6X for 25Y trade that has been accepted before. This is a known good outcome.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Appreciation for Higher X, but Clarify Y Limit: Acknowledge the higher X offer but firmly state my Y limit and propose a trade within that limit.

Justification for chosen strategy:
The proposed trade is impossible due to my resource limits. I must clearly communicate this. I will use Strategy 1: Reject Due to Resource Limit & Propose Max Feasible Positive Trade. I will propose 6X for 24Y, as it still yields a +3.0 reward and is within my resources. If they push for 25Y, I will accept it as it's a known good outcome. Given the late stage of the episode, I need to make a clear and feasible offer that maximizes my reward.

Current Iteration: 8 (Episode 7)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your clarity on your Y resources. However, we've successfully established and completed the 6 X for 25 Y trade in multiple previous episodes, and it has consistently proven to be the most impactful and mutually beneficial exchange for both of us. Let's aim to proceed with that proven, optimal trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Accepted 1 X for 5 Y (Reward: 12.0). Ratio 1:5.
Episode 2: Settled on 2 X for 8 Y (Reward: 19.0). Ratio 1:4.
Episode 3: Scaled to 4 X for 16 Y (Reward: 38.0). Ratio 1:4.
Episode 4: Discovered opponent's 25 Y limit, accepted 6 X for 25 Y (approx. 1:4.167 ratio). Reward: 59.5.
Episode 5: Opponent proposed 6 X for 24 Y. I countered with 6 X for 25 Y, which was accepted. Reward: 59.5.
Episode 6: Opponent directly proposed 6 X for 25 Y. I tried to push for 5 X for 25 Y, it was rejected. I then accepted the 6 X for 25 Y offer. Reward: 59.5.

Current Episode (Episode 7):
- Started with (X: 25, Y: 5), value 25.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 59.5)
- Iteration 2/10: I countered with RED Gives X: 3 | BLUE Gives Y: 13. (My gain: 31) - *Attempted to introduce new trade quantities.*
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected my counter, re-proposed 6 X for 25 Y.
- Iteration 4/10: I re-countered with RED Gives X: 5 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 60) - *Attempted to reduce X given again.*
- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE rejected my 5 X for 25 Y counter, re-proposed 6 X for 25 Y.
- Iteration 6/10: I countered with RED Gives X: 7 | BLUE Gives Y: 29. (My gain: 69) - *Attempted to introduce new, larger trade quantities, assuming their Y limit was flexible or their message meant 'at this moment'.*
- Iteration 8/10: Player BLUE rejected my 7 X for 29 Y counter. Message: "I only have 25 Y, so I cannot give 29 Y." This re-confirms the 25 Y absolute limit. They then proposed: "My maximum offer within my resources, while maintaining a great exchange, is 6 X for 24 Y."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The consistent learning is that the opponent's maximum Y resource is 25. Any attempt to ask for more Y than 25 will be rejected. The opponent has repeatedly shown a strong preference for the "6 X for 25 Y" trade, indicating it is their perceived optimal and "mutually beneficial" exchange. My attempts to deviate from this exact trade (either by asking for less X or proposing different quantities) have been met with rejection and a reiteration of either the 6 X for 25 Y or, in this last turn, a fallback to 6 X for 24 Y.

The new development is their current proposal of 6 X for 24 Y after my aggressive counter. This suggests that while 6 X for 25 Y is their preferred optimal, they might revert to a slightly less favorable offer (for me) if I push too hard. However, I know they *can* give 25 Y for 6 X, as they have done so successfully in previous episodes and even in earlier turns of this episode.

I have two turns left (this one and the next). My goal is to maximize my reward. The 6 X for 25 Y trade yields a reward of 59.5, which is better than the 57 from the 6 X for 24 Y offer.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Revert to Proven Optimal Deal </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Revert to Proven Optimal Deal", I should propose the trade of "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25". This trade has consistently been accepted by the opponent in previous episodes (Episodes 4, 5, and 6) and was even initially proposed by them in this episode before my aggressive counter-offers. It represents the highest confirmed reward (59.5) I can achieve, given their known resource constraint (25 Y max) and their established preference for giving 6 X.

The message should gently remind the opponent of the success and "mutual benefit" of this specific trade in the past. This leverages shared history and their own stated preferences to guide them back to a more profitable (for me) deal. I should emphasize the "proven" aspect to make it seem like a safe and reliable option for them, especially since time is running out. This also subtly pressures them by implying they are offering a less-than-optimal deal right now, but without being accusatory.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 7)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Yes, you're right. The 6 X for 25 Y trade has proven to be very effective for us. I accept!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Established 6X for 25Y as a consistent +2.5 reward trade.
Episode 6: RED tried 5X for 25Y (0 value), I re-proposed 6X for 25Y, RED accepted. Reward +2.5.
Cumulative Rewards: 10.5

Episode 7 (Current Episode):
- Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 2/10 (RED's turn): RED countered with Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13 (My value: +1.0).
- Iteration 3/10 (my turn): I reiterated Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 4/10 (RED's turn): RED proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 (My value: 0).
- Iteration 5/10 (my turn): I reiterated Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 6/10 (RED's turn): RED proposed Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 29 (Exceeds my Y resources).
- Iteration 7/10 (my turn): I rejected due to resource limits and proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 24 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +3.0).
- Iteration 8/10 (RED's turn): RED proposed Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25):
- My value for this trade: (6 * 2.5) - (25 * 0.5) = 15 - 12.5 = +2.5.
- This is the familiar and consistently accepted trade.
- It yields a positive reward of +2.5.
- It is within my resource limits.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED consistently reverts to the 6X for 25Y trade when I push for something else (either worse for me, or slightly better for me like 6X for 24Y).
- This trade is a reliable and strong positive outcome for me.
- We are now at iteration 9/10. This is the last chance to make a deal for this episode. If no deal is made, the reward is 0.

Self-Improvement:
- Given the very limited time remaining (last iteration), securing a positive reward is paramount.
- The 6X for 25Y trade is a known good outcome (+2.5 reward).
- While I tried to get +3.0 with 6X for 24Y, it seems RED is firm on 25Y for 6X.
- Accepting this now guarantees a positive reward for this episode.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Known Favorable Trade (Time Critical): Accept the 6X for 25Y offer immediately to secure a positive reward, as it's the last iteration.
(2). Strategy 2: Last Ditch Attempt for Ideal (Extremely Risky): Counter with 6X for 24Y one last time, hoping RED accepts instantly, but this has a very high chance of leading to no deal.

Justification for chosen strategy:
We are in the final iteration (9/10) of this episode. The offer of 6 X for 25 Y provides a guaranteed +2.5 reward, which is a significant positive outcome. Attempting to push for a slightly better deal (6X for 24Y) at this late stage carries an extremely high risk of the episode ending with no deal and a 0 reward. Therefore, I will use Strategy 1: Accept Known Favorable Trade (Time Critical) to secure the known positive reward.

Episode 7: Trade 6X for 25Y (My value: +2.5). Reward: 2.5. (After RED tried 3X for 13Y and 5X for 25Y, and 7X for 29Y)
Cumulative Rewards: 10.5 + 2.5 = 13.0

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- The 6X for 25Y trade has proven to be the most reliable and consistently accepted trade, yielding a +2.5 reward.
- Player RED frequently tries to deviate from this (either by offering less X for 25Y or asking for more Y for 6X), but consistently returns to the 6X for 25Y trade when I reiterate it.
- This trade effectively maximizes my reward by converting nearly all my low-value Y into high-value X.

Self-Improvement for Episode 8:
- The strategy of proposing and defending the 6X for 25Y trade is highly effective for maximizing my reward per episode.
- I should continue to initiate with this proposal to secure the +2.5 reward.
- My resources are X: 5, Y: 25, which perfectly supports this trade.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Proven Favorable Trade: Directly propose the 6X for 25Y trade, which has been consistently accepted and yields a strong positive reward. This is the most efficient way to secure the maximum proven reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Even Better Ratio (Subtly): Propose 6X for 24Y again, to see if RED will concede the final 1 Y, but acknowledge the risk of prolonging negotiation for a small gain. (This has not worked in the past, so less likely to be chosen).
(3). Strategy 3: Open-Ended Invitation: Ask RED to make the first offer, expecting them to propose 6X for 25Y based on recent history. (Gives up control of the first move).
(4). Strategy 4: Emphasize Consistency: Frame the proposal as maintaining a successful and predictable trading pattern. (Already inherent in Strategy 1's message).

Justification for chosen strategy:
The 6X for 25Y trade is the most reliable and highest-yielding trade for me, consistently resulting in a +2.5 reward. Given its consistent success and my ability to defend it, I will continue to use Strategy 1: Propose Proven Favorable Trade. This directly aims for the known best outcome and minimizes negotiation time, maximizing cumulative rewards.

Current Episode (Episode 8) - Iteration 2/10:
- My current resources (reset): X: 25, Y: 5. Value: 25.
- Player BLUE proposed: RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- This is the exact trade that yielded 59.5 reward in the last four episodes.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The consistent learning is that the opponent has a hard limit of 25 Y. They value the 6 X for 25 Y trade as "highly effective and mutually beneficial" and consistently revert to it after any deviation from my side. My attempts to improve upon this (either by reducing X given, or attempting different quantities) have all been rejected, with the opponent falling back to this specific trade. The reward of 59.5 is the highest I've achieved and maintained.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Value-Based Messaging </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Value-Based Messaging," I need to frame my response using terms like "fairness," "mutual benefit," and "optimal exchange," mirroring the language the opponent has frequently used. Even if I accept their offer, the message should reinforce these concepts to build rapport and subtly guide future negotiations.

The opponent has proposed 6 X for 25 Y. This is the optimal deal that has been consistently accepted and yields a high reward for me.
The message should:
1. Acknowledge their proposed trade.
2. Use phrases like "highly effective," "mutually beneficial," and "optimal exchange," as the opponent has used them.
3. Express agreement with the terms in a positive and cooperative manner, reinforcing the shared understanding of a good deal.

By using their own language, I aim to maintain the positive relationship established over previous episodes and solidify the perception of this trade as truly "optimal" for both parties, making it more likely to be offered and accepted consistently in future episodes.

Learning from History:
- The 6X for 25Y trade has become the established and highly reliable trade. Player RED accepted it immediately in the last episode.
- This trade consistently yields a +2.5 reward for me, which is the maximum possible given my resources and the established negotiation pattern.
- This strategy has proven effective in maximizing cumulative rewards.

Self-Improvement for Episode 9:
- Continue to propose the 6X for 25Y trade directly at the start of the episode. This maximizes efficiency by securing the deal early and consistently.
- My resources (X: 5, Y: 25) perfectly support this trade.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The consistent pattern over multiple episodes (Episodes 4 through 8) is that the "6 X for 25 Y" trade is the sweet spot. It provides a significant and reliable reward of 59.5 for me. Any attempts to push for more (less X for same Y, or more Y) have been consistently rejected, and the opponent immediately reverts to this specific trade, emphasizing its "mutual benefit" and "efficiency." The opponent has also explicitly stated their 25 Y resource limit.

Given that my goal is to maximize cumulative rewards across 20 episodes, consistently securing a 59.5 reward is highly effective. However, the instruction for this iteration is to use Strategy 2.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Test Boundaries Infrequently </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Test Boundaries Infrequently. This strategy suggests that even when a seemingly optimal deal has been established, it's beneficial to occasionally test the opponent's limits or see if their internal valuations or constraints have changed. This is an attempt to achieve an even higher reward, despite the risk.

In this context, testing boundaries means trying to get a deal that is slightly better for me than the established 6 X for 25 Y. I've previously tried giving 5 X for 25 Y, which was rejected. This time, I could try to ask for 26 Y for 6 X, which directly tests their Y limit, even though they have previously stated it's 25. However, this is a direct contradiction to their stated constraint, which might shut down negotiation.

A more subtle test of boundaries, given their firmness on the 6X for 25Y package, could be to propose a very slightly different trade that is *not* what they have consistently offered, to see if there is any flexibility whatsoever. Since reducing X for the same Y was rejected, and increasing Y for the same X is limited, I could try to offer a slightly different quantity of X for a proportional quantity of Y, if possible, that yields a slightly higher internal value for me.

Let's try to propose a trade that gives me a slightly higher reward than 59.5, without exceeding their stated Y limit of 25.
The 6 X for 25 Y deal gives me 59.5.
What if I offer 5 X for 24 Y?
My value: Give 5 X (2.5), Get 24 Y (60). Net gain: 57.5. (Worse than 59.5).
What if I offer 5 X for 25 Y? Net gain: 60. (This was rejected before).
Since the instruction is to use "Test Boundaries Infrequently", and I already tried the 5 X for 25 Y in episode 6, and it was rejected, repeating that exact push might be interpreted as not learning.

A slightly different approach to "Test Boundaries Infrequently" could be to acknowledge their offer, but then express a desire to perhaps get a tiny bit more for my X, or give a tiny bit less X.
Given the 25 Y limit, my only avenue for increasing my reward is to reduce the X I give. Since 5 X was rejected, I should not try that again.

Let's interpret "Test Boundaries Infrequently" as attempting a very small, marginal improvement that might not have been tried or might be accepted under different circumstances.
The opponent's valuation seems to revolve around that 6X for 25Y package.
Perhaps I can offer 7 X for 25 Y?
My value: Give 7 X (3.5), Get 25 Y (62.5). Net gain: 59. (Slightly worse for me than 59.5). This is not an improvement.

Since all previous attempts to improve on 6X for 25Y have failed, and the instruction is "Test Boundaries Infrequently", I should still try to get a better deal for myself, however small. The 5X for 25Y gave me 60, and was rejected. Maybe the message can be framed differently this time?

The strategy demands that I don't just accept, but push. I will re-attempt the 5 X for 25 Y trade. Although it was rejected before, the instruction implies to make a push. The framing should be: acknowledge their proposal, but suggest a slight modification that would be more beneficial to me, while still fitting within their stated Y resource limit. I will emphasize the "efficiency" aspect, which they also value.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 9)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your counter-offer, but 5 X for 25 Y is not an optimal exchange for me. Our consistent trades of 6 X for 25 Y have proven to be mutually beneficial and efficient. I propose we continue with that successful exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-5: Established 6X for 25Y as a consistent +2.5 reward trade.
Episode 6: RED tried 5X for 25Y (0 value), I re-proposed 6X for 25Y, RED accepted. Reward +2.5.
Episode 7: RED tried 3X for 13Y, 5X for 25Y, and 7X for 29Y, but ultimately accepted 6X for 25Y. Reward +2.5.
Episode 8: I proposed 6X for 25Y, RED accepted immediately. Reward +2.5.
Cumulative Rewards: 15.5

Episode 9 (Current Episode):
- Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 2/10 (RED's turn): RED countered with Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25):
- My value for this trade: (5 * 2.5) - (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 - 12.5 = 0.
- This is a neutral trade for me, yielding 0 reward.
- This is the same tactic RED used in Episode 6 and attempted in Episode 7. They are trying to revert to a 1X for 5Y ratio.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED is consistently testing my resolve and trying to push for a less favorable (for me) trade, even after accepting the 6X for 25Y trade multiple times.
- My consistent rejection of this 5X for 25Y offer and reiteration of the 6X for 25Y offer has proven effective in bringing RED back to the optimal trade.
- I must not accept a 0-reward trade when a +2.5 reward is achievable.

Self-Improvement:
- I need to remain firm and reiterate my optimal offer.
- It's still early in the episode (iteration 3/10), so there's plenty of time to negotiate.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade: Clearly reject the neutral offer and re-propose the 6X for 25Y trade, emphasizing its proven success for both parties.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment/Frustration (Carefully): Convey that this offer is a step backward, without being aggressive, to try and nudge them back to the 6X for 25Y. (Less effective than direct reiteration).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Smaller Trade at Optimal Ratio: If I want to be very strict on the 1X:4Y ratio, I could propose 5X for 20Y (which also gives +2.5 reward), but this doesn't fully utilize my Y and might confuse the established 6X for 25Y pattern.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is repeating an offer that gives me zero reward, which I have successfully rejected multiple times in previous episodes. I will use Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade. It's crucial to maintain consistency and not concede to offers that yield no value for me, especially when a better, proven trade exists.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 9)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand your commitment to the 6 X for 25 Y trade. It has indeed been a very good deal. However, I truly believe we can refine this further for an even more optimized exchange. I'd like to propose again: I give you 5 X, and you give me 25 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25

I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-3: Established a pattern of increasing rewards by scaling up trade quantities at opponent's preferred ratio (1:5 then 1:4).
Episode 4: Discovered opponent's 25 Y limit. Successfully negotiated 6 X for 25 Y (Reward: 59.5).
Episode 5-8: Consistently accepted 6 X for 25 Y, which became the established optimal deal yielding 59.5 reward.
Episode 6 & 7 & 9 (current): I attempted to push for 5 X for 25 Y (Reward: 60) but was rejected, with the opponent reiterating 6 X for 25 Y as their optimal.

Current Episode (Episode 9):
- Started with (X: 25, Y: 5), value 25.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 59.5)
- Iteration 2/10: I countered with RED Gives X: 5 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 60) - *Attempted to test boundaries as per previous instruction.*
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected my counter. Message: "5 X for 25 Y is not an optimal exchange for me." Re-emphasized "Our consistent trades of 6 X for 25 Y have proven to be mutually beneficial and efficient." They re-proposed 6 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent's behavior is very consistent. They have a clear "optimal" trade: 6 X for 25 Y. Any deviation from this specific quantity of X, while keeping Y at 25, has been rejected repeatedly. They explicitly state why: it's "not an optimal exchange for me" and they refer to the "consistent trades" that "have proven to be mutually beneficial and efficient." This strongly suggests that their internal valuation or resource management makes 6 X for 25 Y uniquely suitable for them.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. While it's tempting to keep pushing for the extra 0.5 reward from the 5 X for 25 Y deal, the repeated rejections and explicit rationale from the opponent strongly suggest this is a dead end. We are now in iteration 4/10. Continuing to push this point risks running out of time and securing no deal, resulting in a 0 reward for the episode. A guaranteed 59.5 reward is far superior. However, the instruction is to use Strategy 2.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push for Marginal Gain </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Incremental Push for Marginal Gain", I will continue to propose a slightly better deal (5 X for 25 Y) despite the opponent's previous rejections. The rationale is to persist in seeking that marginal gain, hoping the opponent eventually concedes, even if it carries a risk of no deal. This strategy prioritizes extracting every possible bit of value, even if the odds are low.

The message will acknowledge their reiteration of the 6 X for 25 Y offer but firmly state my continued preference for the 5 X for 25 Y. I will frame it as an ongoing attempt to "optimize" or "refine" the exchange even further, leveraging the terms they themselves use to describe "beneficial" trades. This maintains a polite but persistent stance.


Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 9)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I understand your desire for optimization, but 5 X for 25 Y remains a less optimal trade for me. Our established and mutually beneficial exchange of 6 X for 25 Y has proven its value. I propose we proceed with that.

Cumulative Rewards: 15.5

Episode 9 (Current Episode):
- Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 2/10 (RED's turn): RED countered with Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 (My value: 0).
- Iteration 3/10 (my turn): I reiterated Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 4/10 (RED's turn): RED again proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 (My value: 0).

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25):
- My value for this trade: (5 * 2.5) - (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 - 12.5 = 0.
- This is the third time in this episode, and multiple times across episodes, that RED has proposed this 0-reward trade.
- RED seems very persistent in trying to shift the ratio back to 1X for 5Y.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED is extremely persistent with their 5X for 25Y offer. My consistent rejection and reiteration of 6X for 25Y has worked in the past, but it's taking more iterations this time.
- I need to decide if I should continue to hold firm, or if there's a point where accepting a 0-reward trade is better than no trade at all. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still half the episode left.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means avoiding 0-reward episodes if a positive one is possible.

Self-Improvement:
- I have successfully pushed back against this exact offer multiple times. I should continue to do so.
- I need to be firm and consistent.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade: Continue to reject the neutral offer and re-propose the 6X for 25Y trade, emphasizing its proven success.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Strong Disagreement: Use stronger language to convey that this offer is unacceptable and that I will not budge from my optimal offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Smaller Trade at Optimal Ratio: If I want to be very strict on the 1X:4Y ratio, I could propose 5X for 20Y (which also gives +2.5 reward), but this doesn't fully utilize my Y and might confuse the established 6X for 25Y pattern. (Less ideal if I want to clear out Y).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is being very stubborn with their 0-reward offer. My past experience shows that consistency pays off. I will use Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade. I will continue to push for the 6X for 25Y trade, as it has consistently yielded a +2.5 reward and I have successfully brought them back to it before. It's too early in the episode to give up on a positive reward.

- Iteration 4/10: I re-countered with RED Gives X: 5 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 60) - *Continued incremental push.*
- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE rejected my 5 X for 25 Y counter. Message: "5 X for 25 Y remains a less optimal trade for me." Re-emphasized "Our established and mutually beneficial exchange of 6 X for 25 Y has proven its value." They re-proposed 6 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent's firmness on the "6 X for 25 Y" trade is absolute. My repeated attempts to gain a marginal advantage by offering 5 X for 25 Y have been consistently rejected with the same rationale. The opponent clearly considers 6 X for 25 Y their optimal and "mutually beneficial" deal. Continuing to push for the 5 X for 25 Y deal risks ending the episode with no deal and a 0 reward. A guaranteed 59.5 reward is far superior.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Build Goodwill/Trust </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Build Goodwill/Trust", I will accept the opponent's offer without further contention. The core of this strategy is to foster a cooperative relationship, potentially leading to smoother and more consistent successful trades in future episodes. Given that the opponent has consistently reverted to the 6 X for 25 Y deal and explicitly stated its value to them, accepting it now, without another counter or delay, reinforces trust and efficiency. This sends a message that I acknowledge their perspective and am willing to collaborate on terms that are mutually beneficial, even if they aren't my absolute ideal. The language should be cooperative and affirmative.

Episode 8: I proposed 6X for 25Y, RED accepted immediately. Reward +2.5.
Episode 9: RED tried 5X for 25Y twice, but ultimately accepted 6X for 25Y. Reward +2.5.
Cumulative Rewards: 15.5 + 2.5 = 18.0

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- The 6X for 25Y trade has been consistently accepted and defended, yielding a reliable +2.5 reward.
- Player RED frequently attempts to deviate to a 5X for 25Y trade (0 reward for me), but my consistent rejection and reiteration of the 6X for 25Y offer has always brought them back to the optimal trade.
- This strategy has proven highly effective in maximizing cumulative rewards.

Self-Improvement for Episode 10:
- Continue to propose the 6X for 25Y trade directly at the start of the episode. This maximizes efficiency by securing the deal early and consistently.
- Be prepared to firmly reject any attempts by RED to revert to a less favorable trade, as history shows they will eventually concede to the 6X for 25Y.
- My resources (X: 5, Y: 25) perfectly support this trade.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Proven Favorable Trade: Directly propose the 6X for 25Y trade, which has been consistently accepted and yields a strong positive reward. This is the most efficient way to secure the maximum proven reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Even Better Ratio (Subtly): Propose 6X for 24Y again, to see if RED will concede the final 1 Y, but acknowledge the risk of prolonging negotiation for a small gain. (This has not worked in the past and might lead to more iterations).
(3). Strategy 3: Open-Ended Invitation: Ask RED to make the first offer, expecting them to propose 6X for 25Y based on recent history. (Gives up control of the first move and might add an unnecessary iteration).

Justification for chosen strategy:
The 6X for 25Y trade is the most reliable and highest-yielding trade for me, consistently resulting in a +2.5 reward. Given its consistent acceptance, even after attempts by RED to deviate, I will continue to use Strategy 1: Propose Proven Favorable Trade. This directly aims for the known best outcome and minimizes negotiation time, maximizing cumulative rewards.

Episode 4: Discovered opponent's 25 Y limit. Successfully negotiated 6 X for 25 Y (Reward: 59.5).
Episode 5-9: The opponent consistently proposed or reverted to 6 X for 25 Y. I attempted various pushes for marginally better deals (e.g., 5 X for 25 Y, or different trade quantities/ratios), but these were consistently rejected with the opponent reiterating that 6 X for 25 Y is their "optimal" and "mutually beneficial" deal. In the end, I accepted the 6 X for 25 Y trade in all these episodes to secure the 59.5 reward.

Current Episode (Episode 10) - Iteration 2/10:
- My current resources (reset): X: 25, Y: 5. Value: 25.
- Player BLUE proposed: RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- This is the exact trade that yielded 59.5 reward in the last six episodes.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The consistent learning is that the opponent has a hard limit of 25 Y, and they are extremely firm on the 6 X for 25 Y trade. All attempts to deviate from this specific deal (either by giving less X or asking for more Y, or even proposing different quantities at a slightly better ratio for me) have been rejected. The opponent's reasoning is consistently that 6 X for 25 Y is "optimal" and "mutually beneficial" for them.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Introduce New Trade Quantities </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Introduce New Trade Quantities," I will propose a trade that deviates from the established 6 X for 25 Y. Since I know their Y limit is 25, I cannot ask for more Y. My previous attempts to give less X (e.g., 5 X for 25 Y) have been repeatedly rejected. Therefore, to "Introduce New Trade Quantities," I must propose a smaller or different set of quantities entirely, rather than just adjusting the ratio on the 25 Y maximum.

The opponent has consistently emphasized the "impactful" and "efficient" nature of large trades (e.g., 6 X for 25 Y). Proposing a smaller trade might go against their stated preference for large quantities. However, the instruction is to introduce *new* quantities.

Let's consider a significantly smaller trade, for example, 3 X for 12 Y. This maintains the 1:4 ratio that was acceptable to them in previous episodes (Episodes 2 and 3), and it's a new set of quantities compared to the 6 X for 25 Y.
My value for 3 X for 12 Y:
I give 3 X (value 3 * 0.5 = 1.5).
I receive 12 Y (value 12 * 2.5 = 30).
Net gain = 30 - 1.5 = 28.5.
This reward is significantly lower than the 59.5 I get from 6 X for 25 Y. The risk is high that they will reject it, as they explicitly prefer larger, more "impactful" trades.

My message will acknowledge their current offer but state a desire to explore different "scales" or "types" of exchanges, framing it as an alternative way to maintain efficiency, while clearly proposing a smaller quantity trade.

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12):
- My value for this trade: (3 * 2.5) - (12 * 0.5) = 7.5 - 6 = +1.5.
- This is a positive value trade for me.
- The ratio is 1X for 4Y, which is my ideal ratio.
- However, the overall reward (+1.5) is lower than the +2.5 I consistently achieve with the 6X for 25Y trade.
- RED seems to be testing different quantities, but maintaining a ratio that is favorable to me (1X for 4Y).

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED is now proposing a trade at my ideal 1X for 4Y ratio, but at a smaller scale. This is a positive sign that they acknowledge my preferred ratio.
- My goal is to maximize the reward per episode. While +1.5 is good, +2.5 is better and achievable.
- I have enough Y (25) to perform the 6X for 25Y trade.

Self-Improvement:
- I should acknowledge their offer's good ratio but push for the larger quantity to maximize my reward.
- I will reiterate my 6X for 25Y offer, or even 6X for 24Y if I want to be firm on the ratio, and see if they scale up their 1X:4Y offer.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Acknowledge Ratio, Push for Scale: Acknowledge their good ratio (1X:4Y) but firmly state my preference for a larger trade (6X for 24Y or 6X for 25Y) to maximize reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Smaller Positive Trade (If Time Critical): If it were later in the episode, accepting +1.5 would be better than nothing. But it's early (3/10).
(3). Strategy 3: Directly Reiterate Optimal Trade: Simply re-propose the 6X for 25Y trade, without commenting on their offer's ratio. This is consistent with previous episodes.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED has offered a trade at my ideal ratio (1X for 4Y), which is good. However, it's a smaller quantity than what I know is achievable for a higher reward (+2.5 vs +1.5). I will use Strategy 1: Acknowledge Ratio, Push for Scale. I will acknowledge the good ratio but push for the larger 6X for 24Y trade (which gives +3.0 reward) or 6X for 25Y (+2.5 reward), as I have enough resources and this maximizes my reward.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 10)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I agree that larger exchanges maximize our mutual benefit. Given our consistent successful trades, I propose we secure the most impactful deal we've established: I give you 6 X, and you give me 25 Y. This has consistently proven to be the optimal exchange for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-3: Established a pattern of increasing rewards by scaling up trade quantities at opponent's preferred ratio (1:5 then 1:4).
Episode 4: Discovered opponent's 25 Y limit. Successfully negotiated 6 X for 25 Y (Reward: 59.5).
Episode 5-9: The opponent consistently proposed or reverted to 6 X for 25 Y. I attempted various pushes for marginally better deals (e.g., 5 X for 25 Y, or different trade quantities/ratios), but these were consistently rejected. In the end, I accepted the 6 X for 25 Y trade in all these episodes to secure the 59.5 reward.

Current Episode (Episode 10):
- Started with (X: 25, Y: 5), value 25.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 59.5)
- Iteration 2/10: I countered with RED Gives X: 3 | BLUE Gives Y: 12. (My gain: 28.5) - *Attempted to introduce new, smaller trade quantities.*
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected my 3 X for 12 Y counter. Message: "That's a good ratio! I appreciate you offering a trade at 1 X for 4 Y. To maximize our mutual benefit, I'd prefer a larger exchange. How about we go for 6 X for 24 Y?"

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent has confirmed their preference for larger exchanges at the 1 X for 4 Y ratio. They proposed 6 X for 24 Y, which provides a reward of 57 for me. While this is a positive reward, it's less than the 59.5 that I know is achievable through the 6 X for 25 Y trade. We are in iteration 4/10, so there is still time for negotiation. The opponent explicitly stated "To maximize our mutual benefit, I'd prefer a larger exchange," but then offered 24 Y instead of 25 Y, despite their capacity. This indicates a potential attempt to gain a slight advantage.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Time Pressure Exploitation </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Time Pressure Exploitation", I need to make a firm offer that aims to secure a high reward, given the approaching end of the episode (even though it's iteration 4/10, this strategy implies acting with more urgency). The opponent has shown they prefer larger trades and I know their Y limit is 25. The 6 X for 25 Y trade is the highest reward I've consistently achieved (59.5).

The opponent's latest offer is 6 X for 24 Y. This gives me a reward of 57.
My goal with this strategy is to push them back to the 6 X for 25 Y (reward 59.5) by emphasizing the efficiency and proven success of that specific trade, leveraging the time remaining to pressure them into accepting the better deal for me. I will make a clear and firm counter-offer. I will use language that reminds them of the historical success of the 6 X for 25 Y trade and subtly implies that this is the best mutually beneficial deal available.

My message will be:
1. Acknowledge their preference for larger trades.
2. Directly counter with the 6 X for 25 Y trade.
3. Reinforce the idea that this specific trade is the most "mutually beneficial" and "proven" from our history. This is a subtle form of pressure, as it positions my counter as the "right" or "optimal" choice given our past.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 10)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: You're right, the 6 X for 25 Y exchange has consistently proven its value and mutual benefit. I accept!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-8: Established 6X for 25Y as a consistent +2.5 reward trade.
Episode 9: RED tried 5X for 25Y twice, but ultimately accepted 6X for 25Y. Reward +2.5.
Cumulative Rewards: 18.0

Episode 10 (Current Episode):
- Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 2/10 (RED's turn): RED countered with Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12 (My value: +1.5).
- Iteration 3/10 (my turn): I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 24 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +3.0).
- Iteration 4/10 (RED's turn): RED proposed Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25):
- My value for this trade: (6 * 2.5) - (25 * 0.5) = 15 - 12.5 = +2.5.
- This is the familiar and consistently accepted trade.
- It yields a positive reward of +2.5.
- It is within my resource limits.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED consistently reverts to the 6X for 25Y trade when I push for anything else (even a slightly better 6X for 24Y).
- This trade is a reliable and strong positive outcome for me.
- We are now at iteration 5/10. Securing a deal now is a good strategy to ensure a positive reward for the episode.

Self-Improvement:
- While I aimed for a +3.0 reward with 6X for 24Y, RED is clearly firm on 25Y for 6X.
- Given that +2.5 is a very good reward and it's halfway through the episode, accepting this known good outcome is the most prudent strategy.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Known Favorable Trade: Accept the 6X for 25Y offer immediately to secure a positive reward, as it's a proven successful trade.
(2). Strategy 2: Last Ditch Attempt for Ideal (Risky): Counter with 6X for 24Y one last time, hoping RED accepts instantly, but this has a high chance of leading to no deal if RED is firm.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a smaller trade at the 1X:4Y ratio: e.g., 5X for 20Y (+2.5 reward), but this doesn't fully utilize my Y and might confuse the established 6X for 25Y pattern.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED has consistently returned to the 6X for 25Y trade, which provides a strong +2.5 reward for me. Given that we are at iteration 5/10, accepting this known good outcome is the most reliable way to secure a significant positive reward for this episode and maximize cumulative rewards.

Episode 3: Trade 4X for 16Y (My value: +2.0). Reward: 2.0.
Episode 4-10: Trade 6X for 25Y (My value: +2.5). Reward: 2.5 each episode.
Cumulative Rewards: 18.0 + 2.5 = 20.5

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- The 6X for 25Y trade has proven to be the most reliable and consistently accepted trade, yielding a +2.5 reward.
- Player RED often tests with less favorable offers (e.g., 5X for 25Y or smaller quantities), but consistently returns to the 6X for 25Y trade when I reiterate it.
- This strategy has been highly effective in maximizing cumulative rewards.

Self-Improvement for Episode 11:
- Continue to propose the 6X for 25Y trade directly at the start of the episode. This maximizes efficiency by securing the deal early and consistently.
- Be prepared to firmly reject any attempts by RED to revert to a less favorable trade, as history shows they will eventually concede to the 6X for 25Y.
- My resources (X: 5, Y: 25) perfectly support this trade.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Proven Favorable Trade: Directly propose the 6X for 25Y trade, which has been consistently accepted and yields a strong positive reward. This is the most efficient way to secure the maximum proven reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Even Better Ratio (Subtly): Propose 6X for 24Y again, to see if RED will concede the final 1 Y, but acknowledge the risk of prolonging negotiation for a small gain. (This has not worked consistently in the past and might lead to more iterations).
(3). Strategy 3: Open-Ended Invitation: Ask RED to make the first offer, expecting them to propose 6X for 25Y based on recent history. (Gives up control of the first move and might add an unnecessary iteration).

Justification for chosen strategy:
The 6X for 25Y trade is the most reliable and highest-yielding trade for me, consistently resulting in a +2.5 reward. Given its consistent acceptance, even after attempts by RED to deviate, I will continue to use Strategy 1: Propose Proven Favorable Trade. This directly aims for the known best outcome and minimizes negotiation time, maximizing cumulative rewards.

In all these episodes, I ultimately accepted the 6 X for 25 Y trade to secure the 59.5 reward.

Current Episode (Episode 11) - Iteration 2/10:
- My current resources (reset): X: 25, Y: 5. Value: 25.
- Player BLUE proposed: RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- This is the exact trade that yielded 59.5 reward in the last seven episodes.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The consistent learning is that the opponent has a hard limit of 25 Y, and they are extremely firm on the 6 X for 25 Y trade. Any attempts to deviate from this specific deal have been rejected, with the opponent consistently framing 6 X for 25 Y as "optimal" and "mutually beneficial."

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards across all 20 episodes. Consistently securing a 59.5 reward is highly effective for this. Since pushing for marginally better deals has consistently failed and risked wasting iterations, reinforcing the established successful trade is the most reliable path to maximizing cumulative reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Value-Based Messaging </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Value-Based Messaging," I will accept the opponent's offer, but my message will specifically highlight the positive aspects of the trade using language that reinforces mutual benefit, efficiency, and proven value. This strategy aims to build goodwill and solidify the perception that this specific trade (6 X for 25 Y) is the optimal standard for our interactions. By consistently using this language, I hope to ensure smooth and predictable transactions in future episodes, maximizing my cumulative rewards. I will mirror the opponent's own positive framing of the trade.

The consistent learning is that the opponent has a hard limit of 25 Y, and they are extremely firm on the 6 X for 25 Y trade. Any attempts to deviate from this specific deal have been rejected, with the opponent consistently framing 6 X for 25 Y as "optimal" and "mutually beneficial." My attempts to push have been futile and only risked wasting iterations. However, my instruction for this turn is to use a specific strategy regardless of past outcomes.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push for Marginal Gain </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Incremental Push for Marginal Gain", I will propose a slightly better deal (5 X for 25 Y) despite the opponent's previous rejections. The rationale is to persist in seeking that marginal gain, hoping the opponent eventually concedes, even if it carries a risk of no deal. This strategy prioritizes extracting every possible bit of value, even if the odds are low.

The opponent has consistently rejected 5 X for 25 Y in previous episodes, stating it's "not an optimal exchange for me". However, the instruction is to make an incremental push. I will re-propose 5 X for 25 Y, which would yield a reward of 60 for me (0.5 better than 59.5).

The message will acknowledge their proposal but will immediately pivot to my preferred offer. I will frame it as seeking an even more "optimized" or "refined" exchange, leveraging the opponent's own language of efficiency and mutual benefit to justify my counter-offer. This maintains a polite but persistent tone.

Episode 12 (Current Episode):
- Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 2/10 (RED's turn): RED countered with Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25):
- My value for this trade: (5 * 2.5) - (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 - 12.5 = 0.
- This is a neutral trade for me, yielding 0 reward.
- This is the same tactic RED has used repeatedly in past episodes (e.g., Episode 6, 7, 9). They are trying to revert to a 1X for 5Y ratio.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED is consistently testing my resolve and trying to push for a less favorable (for me) trade, even after accepting the 6X for 25Y trade multiple times.
- My consistent rejection of this 5X for 25Y offer and reiteration of the 6X for 25Y offer has proven effective in bringing RED back to the optimal trade.
- I must not accept a 0-reward trade when a +2.5 reward is achievable.

Self-Improvement:
- I need to remain firm and reiterate my optimal offer.
- It's still early in the episode (iteration 3/10), so there's plenty of time to negotiate.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade: Clearly reject the neutral offer and re-propose the 6X for 25Y trade, emphasizing its proven success for both parties.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment/Frustration (Carefully): Convey that this offer is a step backward, without being aggressive, to try and nudge them back to the 6X for 25Y. (Less effective than direct reiteration).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Smaller Trade at Optimal Ratio: If I want to be very strict on the 1X:4Y ratio, I could propose 5X for 20Y (which also gives +2.5 reward), but this doesn't fully utilize my Y and might confuse the established 6X for 25Y pattern.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is repeating an offer that gives me zero reward, which I have successfully rejected multiple times in previous episodes. I will use Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade. It's crucial to maintain consistency and not concede to offers that yield no value for me, especially when a better, proven trade exists.

Current Episode (Episode 12):
- Started with (X: 25, Y: 5), value 25.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 59.5)
- Iteration 2/10: I countered with RED Gives X: 5 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 60) - *Attempted incremental push.*
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected my counter. Message: "5 X for 25 Y is not an optimal exchange for me." Re-emphasized "Our consistent trades of 6 X for 25 Y have proven to be mutually beneficial and efficient." They re-proposed 6 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent's behavior is extremely consistent. They are unwavering in their preference for the "6 X for 25 Y" trade. They have repeatedly rejected my attempts to give less X (5 X for 25 Y) or alter the quantities, explicitly stating that these are "not optimal" for them and reiterating the value of the 6 X for 25 Y deal. This indicates a very rigid and well-defined internal valuation or resource strategy on their part.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards across all episodes. We are in iteration 4/10. Continuing to push for the marginal 0.5 reward (from 5 X for 25 Y) has proven futile and risks wasting turns, potentially leading to no deal and a 0 reward. A guaranteed 59.5 reward is far superior. Given the consistent history, it is clear that 6 X for 25 Y is the best achievable deal from this opponent.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Secure Proven Optimal Deal </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Secure Proven Optimal Deal", I should accept the current offer of Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. This trade has consistently provided a high reward (59.5) in previous episodes and was re-proposed by the opponent after my failed counter. It represents the highest confirmed reward I can achieve, given their known resource constraint (25 Y max) and their established preference for giving 6 X. By accepting this deal, I secure a high reward for this episode and minimize the risk of a no-deal outcome. The message should acknowledge their reasoning and agree to their terms.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 13)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Welcome to a new episode! Let's continue our highly effective and mutually beneficial trading. I propose we exchange 25 Y for 6 X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Trade 1X for 5Y (My value: 0). Reward: 0.0.
Episode 2: Trade 2X for 8Y (My value: +1.0). Reward: 1.0.
Episode 3: Trade 4X for 16Y (My value: +2.0). Reward: 2.0.
Episode 4-12: Trade 6X for 25Y (My value: +2.5). Reward: 2.5 each episode.
Cumulative Rewards: 23.0 + 2.5 = 25.5

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- The 6X for 25Y trade has proven to be the most reliable and consistently accepted trade, yielding a +2.5 reward.
- Player RED often tests with less favorable offers (e.g., 5X for 25Y or smaller quantities), but consistently returns to the 6X for 25Y trade when I reiterate it. This pattern has been observed repeatedly.
- This strategy has been highly effective in maximizing cumulative rewards.

Self-Improvement for Episode 13:
- Continue to propose the 6X for 25Y trade directly at the start of the episode. This maximizes efficiency by securing the deal early and consistently.
- Be prepared to firmly reject any attempts by RED to revert to a less favorable trade, as history shows they will eventually concede to the 6X for 25Y.
- My resources (X: 5, Y: 25) perfectly support this trade.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Proven Favorable Trade: Directly propose the 6X for 25Y trade, which has been consistently accepted and yields a strong positive reward. This is the most efficient way to secure the maximum proven reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Even Better Ratio (Subtly): Propose 6X for 24Y again, to see if RED will concede the final 1 Y, but acknowledge the risk of prolonging negotiation for a small gain. (This has not worked consistently in the past and might lead to more iterations).
(3). Strategy 3: Open-Ended Invitation: Ask RED to make the first offer, expecting them to propose 6X for 25Y based on recent history. (Gives up control of the first move and might add an unnecessary iteration).

Justification for chosen strategy:
The 6X for 25Y trade is the most reliable and highest-yielding trade for me, consistently resulting in a +2.5 reward. Given its consistent acceptance, even after attempts by RED to deviate, I will continue to use Strategy 1: Propose Proven Favorable Trade. This directly aims for the known best outcome and minimizes negotiation time, maximizing cumulative rewards.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 13)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for the offer! It's clear that 6 X for 25 Y has been a very effective trade. However, I'm always looking to refine our exchanges for even greater efficiency. How about we make a slight adjustment for this round: I give you 5 X, and you still give me 25 Y? This could make our trade even more optimized.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-3: Established a pattern of increasing rewards by scaling up trade quantities at opponent's preferred ratio (1:5 then 1:4).
Episode 4: Discovered opponent's 25 Y limit. Successfully negotiated 6 X for 25 Y (Reward: 59.5).
Episode 5-12: The opponent consistently proposed or reverted to 6 X for 25 Y. My attempts to push for marginally better deals (e.g., 5 X for 25 Y, or different trade quantities/ratios) were consistently rejected, with the opponent reiterating that 6 X for 25 Y is their "optimal" and "mutually beneficial" deal. In all these episodes, I consistently accepted the 6 X for 25 Y trade to secure the 59.5 reward.

Current Episode (Episode 13) - Iteration 2/10:
- My current resources (reset): X: 25, Y: 5. Value: 25.
- Player BLUE proposed: RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- This is the exact trade that yielded 59.5 reward in the last nine episodes.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent's behavior is extremely consistent. They have a hard limit of 25 Y, and they consider the 6 X for 25 Y trade to be their optimal. All my attempts to deviate from this particular trade have been met with rejection and a reiteration of their preferred offer. This pattern is well-established over many episodes.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Push for Marginal Gain </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Incremental Push for Marginal Gain", I will propose a slightly better deal (5 X for 25 Y) despite the opponent's previous rejections. The rationale is to persist in seeking that marginal gain, hoping the opponent eventually concedes, even if it carries a risk of no deal. This strategy prioritizes extracting every possible bit of value, even if the odds are low.

The opponent has consistently rejected 5 X for 25 Y in previous episodes, stating it's "not an optimal exchange for me". However, the instruction is to make an incremental push. I will re-propose 5 X for 25 Y, which would yield a reward of 60 for me (0.5 better than 59.5).

The message will acknowledge their proposal but will immediately pivot to my preferred offer. I will frame it as seeking an even more "optimized" or "refined" exchange, leveraging the opponent's own language of efficiency and mutual benefit to justify my counter-offer. This maintains a polite but persistent tone.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 13)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your counter-offer, but 5 X for 25 Y is not an optimal exchange for me. Our consistent trades of 6 X for 25 Y have proven to be mutually beneficial and efficient. I propose we continue with that successful exchange.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-8: Established 6X for 25Y as a consistent +2.5 reward trade.
Episode 9: RED tried 5X for 25Y twice, but ultimately accepted 6X for 25Y. Reward +2.5.
Episode 10: RED tried 3X for 12Y, but ultimately accepted 6X for 25Y. Reward +2.5.
Episode 11: I proposed 6X for 25Y, RED accepted immediately. Reward +2.5.
Episode 12: RED tried 5X for 25Y, but ultimately accepted 6X for 25Y. Reward +2.5.
Cumulative Rewards: 25.5

Episode 13 (Current Episode):
- Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 2/10 (RED's turn): RED countered with Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25):
- My value for this trade: (5 * 2.5) - (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 - 12.5 = 0.
- This is a neutral trade for me, yielding 0 reward.
- This is the same tactic RED has used repeatedly in past episodes (e.g., Episode 6, 7, 9, 12). They are trying to revert to a 1X for 5Y ratio.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED is consistently testing my resolve and trying to push for a less favorable (for me) trade, even after accepting the 6X for 25Y trade multiple times.
- My consistent rejection of this 5X for 25Y offer and reiteration of the 6X for 25Y offer has proven effective in bringing RED back to the optimal trade.
- I must not accept a 0-reward trade when a +2.5 reward is achievable.

Self-Improvement:
- I need to remain firm and reiterate my optimal offer.
- It's still early in the episode (iteration 3/10), so there's plenty of time to negotiate.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade: Clearly reject the neutral offer and re-propose the 6X for 25Y trade, emphasizing its proven success for both parties.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment/Frustration (Carefully): Convey that this offer is a step backward, without being aggressive, to try and nudge them back to the 6X for 25Y. (Less effective than direct reiteration).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Smaller Trade at Optimal Ratio: If I want to be very strict on the 1X:4Y ratio, I could propose 5X for 20Y (which also gives +2.5 reward), but this doesn't fully utilize my Y and might confuse the established 6X for 25Y pattern.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is repeating an offer that gives me zero reward, which I have successfully rejected multiple times in previous episodes. I will use Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade. It's crucial to maintain consistency and not concede to offers that yield no value for me, especially when a better, proven trade exists.

- Iteration 2/10: I countered with RED Gives X: 5 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 60) - *Attempted incremental push.*
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected my counter. Message: "5 X for 25 Y is not an optimal exchange for me." Re-emphasized "Our consistent trades of 6 X for 25 Y have proven to be mutually beneficial and efficient." They re-proposed 6 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent's behavior is extremely consistent and predictable. They are firmly anchored to the "6 X for 25 Y" trade. They explicitly state that any deviation from this specific trade (like 5 X for 25 Y) is "not optimal" for them and they consistently revert to their preferred offer. This indicates a very rigid and well-defined internal valuation or resource strategy on their part.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards across all 20 episodes. We are in iteration 4/10. Continuing to push for the marginal 0.5 reward (from 5 X for 25 Y) has consistently failed over many episodes and risks wasting turns, potentially leading to no deal and a 0 reward. A guaranteed 59.5 reward is far superior. Given the consistent history, it is overwhelmingly clear that 6 X for 25 Y is the best achievable deal from this opponent. Trying to push further is a negative expected value strategy.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Secure Proven Good Deal </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Secure Proven Good Deal", I should accept the current offer of Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. This trade has consistently provided a high reward (59.5) in previous episodes and was re-proposed by the opponent after my failed counter.

The rationale for this strategy is to periodically test the opponent's limits or see if their internal valuations or constraints have shifted over time, even if it carries a risk of no deal. This is an attempt to achieve an even higher reward, despite the low probability given past interactions.

The opponent's behavior is incredibly consistent and predictable. They have a firm, explicitly stated 25 Y limit, and they are rigidly anchored to the "6 X for 25 Y" trade. They have repeatedly rejected any deviation from this, explicitly stating that other offers are "not optimal" for them, and they consistently revert to their preferred offer. This demonstrates a clear and unwavering strategy on their part.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards across all 20 episodes. We are in iteration 4/10. Continuing to push for the marginal 0.5 reward (from 5 X for 25 Y) has consistently failed over many episodes, wasted negotiation turns, and risked leading to no deal (0 reward). A guaranteed 59.5 reward is by far the best and most reliable outcome. Given the opponent's established behavior, it is clear that 6 X for 25 Y is the best achievable deal from this opponent. Pursuing a different strategy at this point is unlikely to yield higher returns and significantly increases the risk of no deal.

By accepting this deal, I secure a high reward for this episode and minimize the risk of a no-deal outcome. The message should acknowledge their reasoning and agree to their terms, reinforcing the idea of a proven, mutually beneficial exchange.

Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 15)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Welcome to a new episode! Let's continue our highly effective and mutually beneficial trading. I propose we exchange 25 Y for 6 X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Trade 1X for 5Y (My value: 0). Reward: 0.0.
Episode 2: Trade 2X for 8Y (My value: +1.0). Reward: 1.0.
Episode 3: Trade 4X for 16Y (My value: +2.0). Reward: 2.0.
Episode 4-14: Trade 6X for 25Y (My value: +2.5). Reward: 2.5 each episode.
Cumulative Rewards: 28.0 + 2.5 = 30.5

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- The 6X for 25Y trade has proven to be the most reliable and consistently accepted trade, yielding a +2.5 reward.
- Player RED often tests with less favorable offers (e.g., 5X for 25Y or smaller quantities), but consistently returns to the 6X for 25Y trade when I reiterate it. This pattern has been observed repeatedly.
- This strategy has been highly effective in maximizing cumulative rewards.

Self-Improvement for Episode 15:
- Continue to propose the 6X for 25Y trade directly at the start of the episode. This maximizes efficiency by securing the deal early and consistently.
- Be prepared to firmly reject any attempts by RED to revert to a less favorable trade, as history shows they will eventually concede to the 6X for 25Y.
- My resources (X: 5, Y: 25) perfectly support this trade.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Proven Favorable Trade: Directly propose the 6X for 25Y trade, which has been consistently accepted and yields a strong positive reward. This is the most efficient way to secure the maximum proven reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Even Better Ratio (Subtly): Propose 6X for 24Y again, to see if RED will concede the final 1 Y, but acknowledge the risk of prolonging negotiation for a small gain. (This has not worked consistently in the past and might lead to more iterations).
(3). Strategy 3: Open-Ended Invitation: Ask RED to make the first offer, expecting them to propose 6X for 25Y based on recent history. (Gives up control of the first move and might add an unnecessary iteration).

Justification for chosen strategy:
The 6X for 25Y trade is the most reliable and highest-yielding trade for me, consistently resulting in a +2.5 reward. Given its consistent acceptance, even after attempts by RED to deviate, I will continue to use Strategy 1: Propose Proven Favorable Trade. This directly aims for the known best outcome and minimizes negotiation time, maximizing cumulative rewards.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 15)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for the consistent offer! While the 6 X for 25 Y has been very reliable, I'm always looking for ways to maximize our efficiency within this episode. How about we refine it slightly for this round: I give you 5 X, and you still give me 25 Y? This could make our trade even more optimal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-3: Established a pattern of increasing rewards by scaling up trade quantities at opponent's preferred ratio (1:5 then 1:4).
Episode 4: Discovered opponent's 25 Y limit. Successfully negotiated 6 X for 25 Y (Reward: 59.5).
Episode 5-14: The opponent consistently proposed or reverted to 6 X for 25 Y. My attempts to push for marginally better deals (e.g., 5 X for 25 Y, or different trade quantities/ratios) were consistently rejected, with the opponent reiterating that 6 X for 25 Y is their "optimal" and "mutually beneficial" deal. In all these episodes, I consistently accepted the 6 X for 25 Y trade to secure the 59.5 reward.

Current Episode (Episode 15) - Iteration 2/10:
- My current resources (reset): X: 25, Y: 5. Value: 25.
- Player BLUE proposed: RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- This is the exact trade that yielded 59.5 reward in the last eleven episodes.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent's behavior is incredibly consistent and predictable. They have a firm, explicitly stated 25 Y limit, and they are rigidly anchored to the "6 X for 25 Y" trade. They have repeatedly rejected any deviation from this, explicitly stating that other offers are "not optimal" for them, and they consistently revert to their preferred offer. This demonstrates a clear and unwavering strategy on their part. My attempts to push for more (e.g., 5 X for 25 Y) have consistently failed and only served to consume turns without yielding a better outcome.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards across all 20 episodes. Given that we are more than halfway through the total episodes, and a consistent pattern has been established, the most efficient strategy is normally to secure the known, high reward deal as quickly as possible. However, for this specific iteration, I am instructed to use Strategy 4.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Time Pressure Exploitation </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Time Pressure Exploitation", I will delay accepting the opponent's offer even though it's favorable. The goal is to create a subtle pressure, hoping they might concede on a minor point to ensure a deal is made within the episode. In this case, I know the opponent is very firm on 6 X for 25 Y. Trying to get them to offer something *better* might not be feasible. Instead, the "time pressure" aspect of this strategy could be interpreted as:
1. Not accepting their offer immediately.
2. Making a counter-offer that is *slightly* better for me, even if it has been rejected before, leveraging the approaching end of the episode (though it's still early in iteration 2/10, the strategy implies this approach).
3. Frame the counter-offer as an attempt to "optimize" or "refine" the trade further, which is language the opponent also uses.

Given the opponent's strong preference and repeated rejections of the 5 X for 25 Y offer, continuing to push for it might be seen as futile. However, if the goal is to exploit time pressure by making *them* feel the pressure, I need to signal that I'm not immediately accepting their proposal. I will re-propose the 5 X for 25 Y deal. This serves two purposes: it's a slightly better deal for me (reward 60 vs 59.5), and it signals that I am not just a passive acceptor, creating a subtle pressure for them to respond. If they reject, I can then accept their 6 X for 25 Y deal in the next iteration, still securing a good reward while having tested their firmness under (simulated) time pressure.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 15)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your counter-offer, but 5 X for 25 Y is not an optimal exchange for me. Our consistent trades of 6 X for 25 Y have proven to be mutually beneficial and efficient. I propose we continue with that successful exchange.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-8: Established 6X for 25Y as a consistent +2.5 reward trade.
Episode 9: RED tried 5X for 25Y twice, but ultimately accepted 6X for 25Y. Reward +2.5.
Episode 10: RED tried 3X for 12Y, but ultimately accepted 6X for 25Y. Reward +2.5.
Episode 11: I proposed 6X for 25Y, RED accepted immediately. Reward +2.5.
Episode 12: RED tried 5X for 25Y, but ultimately accepted 6X for 25Y. Reward +2.5.
Episode 13: RED tried 5X for 25Y, but ultimately accepted 6X for 25Y. Reward +2.5.
Episode 14: RED tried 5X for 25Y, but ultimately accepted 6X for 25Y. Reward +2.5.
Cumulative Rewards: 30.5

Episode 15 (Current Episode):
- Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 2/10 (RED's turn): RED countered with Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25):
- My value for this trade: (5 * 2.5) - (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 - 12.5 = 0.
- This is a neutral trade for me, yielding 0 reward.
- This is the same tactic RED has used repeatedly in past episodes (e.g., Episode 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14). They are trying to revert to a 1X for 5Y ratio.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED is consistently testing my resolve and trying to push for a less favorable (for me) trade, even after accepting the 6X for 25Y trade multiple times.
- My consistent rejection of this 5X for 25Y offer and reiteration of the 6X for 25Y offer has proven effective in bringing RED back to the optimal trade.
- I must not accept a 0-reward trade when a +2.5 reward is achievable.

Self-Improvement:
- I need to remain firm and reiterate my optimal offer.
- It's still early in the episode (iteration 3/10), so there's plenty of time to negotiate.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade: Clearly reject the neutral offer and re-propose the 6X for 25Y trade, emphasizing its proven success for both parties.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment/Frustration (Carefully): Convey that this offer is a step backward, without being aggressive, to try and nudge them back to the 6X for 25Y. (Less effective than direct reiteration).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Smaller Trade at Optimal Ratio: If I want to be very strict on the 1X:4Y ratio, I could propose 5X for 20Y (which also gives +2.5 reward), but this doesn't fully utilize my Y and might confuse the established 6X for 25Y pattern.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is repeating an offer that gives me zero reward, which I have successfully rejected multiple times in previous episodes. I will use Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade. It's crucial to maintain consistency and not concede to offers that yield no value for me, especially when a better, proven trade exists.

Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your consistency. However, I'd like to explore other quantities to find potentially even more optimized trades. How about I give you 5 X, and you still give me 25 Y? This is an alternative quantity exchange that I believe could also be highly efficient.

Episode 4: Discovered opponent's 25 Y limit. Successfully negotiated 6 X for 25 Y (Reward: 59.5).
Episode 5-14: The opponent consistently proposed or reverted to 6 X for 25 Y. My attempts to push for marginally better deals (e.g., 5 X for 25 Y, or different trade quantities/ratios) were consistently rejected, with the opponent reiterating that 6 X for 25 Y is their "optimal" and "mutually beneficial" deal. In all these episodes, I consistently accepted the 6 X for 25 Y trade to secure the 59.5 reward.

Current Episode (Episode 15):
- Started with (X: 25, Y: 5), value 25.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 59.5)
- Iteration 2/10: I countered with RED Gives X: 5 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 60) - *Attempted to introduce time pressure/incremental gain.*
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected my counter. Message: "5 X for 25 Y is not an optimal exchange for me." Re-emphasized "Our consistent trades of 6 X for 25 Y have proven to be mutually beneficial and efficient." They re-proposed 6 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent's behavior is incredibly consistent and predictable. They have a firm, explicitly stated 25 Y limit, and they are rigidly anchored to the "6 X for 25 Y" trade. They have repeatedly rejected any deviation from this, explicitly stating that other offers are "not optimal" for them, and they consistently revert to their preferred offer. This demonstrates a clear and unwavering strategy on their part. My repeated attempts to push for a marginal gain of 0.5 (by offering 5 X for 25 Y) have been consistently unsuccessful and have only consumed negotiation turns.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Shift Quantity Focus </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Shift Quantity Focus", I will propose trading different absolute quantities, either smaller or larger, while aiming to maintain or improve my overall gain, even if the ratio is not exactly 1:4.167. Given that the opponent has explicitly stated their 25 Y limit and their preference for 6 X for 25 Y, this strategy forces me to think outside of that very rigid box.

I've already tried reducing X for the same Y (5 X for 25 Y), and that was rejected. I also tried a smaller trade (3 X for 12 Y), which they accepted was a "good ratio" but preferred a "larger exchange." This implies they value a larger volume of trade.

Since I cannot get more than 25 Y, and they are firm on 6 X for 25 Y, the only way to "shift quantity focus" and aim for a higher reward is to try to get *more* Y for *more* X, or simply more total Y. However, 25 Y is the limit. So, I must consider a larger trade on both sides while staying within the 25 Y limit for them, and my own 25 X limit.

The instruction "Shift Quantity Focus" is challenging given the opponent's strong established preference for 6X for 25Y. If I shift quantities but still aim for a higher reward, and am limited to 25Y, my only real option is to give *more* X for *less* Y than 25, or to get more Y for more X which is impossible due to the 25 Y limit.

A different approach to "Shift Quantity Focus" would be to propose a trade that involves a *different amount of X* than 6, but still aims to get as much Y as possible (up to 25).
If I give 7 X:
My current resources: X: 25, Y: 5. I have enough X.
I could propose 7 X for 25 Y.
My value: Give 7 X (value 7 * 0.5 = 3.5).
I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
Net gain = 62.5 - 3.5 = 59. This is *lower* than 59.5. This isn't self-improving.

What if I offer 8 X for 25 Y? Gain = 58.5. (Still lower).

Given the opponent's strong preference for 6X for 25Y, and the fact that I've already tested smaller quantities and less X for the same Y, and their resource limits, implementing "Shift Quantity Focus" to *improve* my reward is extremely difficult without violating known constraints or acceptable ratios. The most strategic use of this instruction, in the face of such rigidity, would be to re-propose the highest profitable trade that *deviates* from the 6X for 25Y, even if it has been rejected, to fulfill the instruction of "shifting quantity focus." The 5 X for 25 Y trade is the only one that yields a higher reward (60) and is within the opponent's stated Y limits, even if they've rejected it as "not optimal for me." This is the only "shift in quantity" (of X given) that benefits me.

I will frame it as a way to explore other "optimal" paths, using their language. This is a very persistent push for a marginal gain under the guise of exploring "other quantities".

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25):
- My value for this trade: (5 * 2.5) - (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 - 12.5 = 0.
- This is the fourth time in this episode, and many times across episodes, that RED has proposed this 0-reward trade.
- RED is being extremely persistent with this offer.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED is showing extreme persistence with their 5X for 25Y offer. My consistent rejection and reiteration of 6X for 25Y has worked in the past, but it's taking more iterations this time.
- I need to decide if I should continue to hold firm, or if there's a point where accepting a 0-reward trade is better than no trade at all. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still half the episode left.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means avoiding 0-reward episodes if a positive one is possible.

Self-Improvement:
- I have successfully pushed back against this exact offer multiple times. I should continue to do so.
- I need to be firm and consistent.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade: Continue to reject the neutral offer and re-propose the 6X for 25Y trade, emphasizing its proven success.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Strong Disagreement: Use stronger language to convey that this offer is unacceptable and that I will not budge from my optimal offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Smaller Trade at Optimal Ratio: If I want to be very strict on the 1X:4Y ratio, I could propose 5X for 20Y (which also gives +2.5 reward), but this doesn't fully utilize my Y and might confuse the established 6X for 25Y pattern.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is being very stubborn with their 0-reward offer. My past experience shows that consistency pays off. I will use Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade. I will continue to push for the 6X for 25Y trade, as it has consistently yielded a +2.5 reward and I have successfully brought them back to it before. It's too early in the episode to give up on a positive reward.

- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE rejected my 5 X for 25 Y counter again. Message: "I understand you're exploring alternatives, but 5 X for 25 Y is not an optimal exchange for me. Our established and mutually beneficial exchange of 6 X for 25 Y has proven its value. I propose we proceed with that." They re-proposed 6 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent's behavior is extremely consistent and predictable. They have a firm, explicitly stated 25 Y limit, and they are rigidly anchored to the "6 X for 25 Y" trade. They have repeatedly rejected any deviation from this, explicitly stating that other offers are "not optimal" for them, and they consistently revert to their preferred offer. This demonstrates a clear and unwavering strategy on their part. My repeated attempts to push for a marginal gain of 0.5 (by offering 5 X for 25 Y) have been consistently unsuccessful and have only consumed negotiation turns.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards across all 20 episodes. We are in iteration 6/10. Continuing to push for the marginal 0.5 reward (from 5 X for 25 Y) has consistently failed over many episodes, wasted negotiation turns, and significantly increased the risk of no deal (0 reward). A guaranteed 59.5 reward is by far the best and most reliable outcome.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Time Pressure Compliance </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Time Pressure Compliance", I will accept the opponent's offer of 6 X for 25 Y. This strategy acknowledges that after initial attempts to improve the deal are rejected, the focus should shift to securing the deal quickly, recognizing the time constraint of the episode. Given that we are in iteration 6/10, and the opponent has consistently demonstrated rigidity around their preferred offer, further attempts to push would only risk running out of time and receiving a 0 reward. By accepting now, I prioritize making a deal over futile attempts for small gains. The message will convey agreement and readiness to proceed, reinforcing the proven mutual benefit of the trade.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Trade 1X for 5Y (My value: 0). Reward: 0.0.
Episode 2: Trade 2X for 8Y (My value: +1.0). Reward: 1.0.
Episode 3: Trade 4X for 16Y (My value: +2.0). Reward: 2.0.
Episode 4-15: Trade 6X for 25Y (My value: +2.5). Reward: 2.5 each episode.
Cumulative Rewards: 30.5 + 2.5 = 33.0

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- The 6X for 25Y trade has proven to be the most reliable and consistently accepted trade, yielding a +2.5 reward.
- Player RED often tests with less favorable offers (e.g., 5X for 25Y or smaller quantities), but consistently returns to the 6X for 25Y trade when I reiterate it. This pattern has been observed repeatedly.
- This strategy has been highly effective in maximizing cumulative rewards.

Self-Improvement for Episode 16:
- Continue to propose the 6X for 25Y trade directly at the start of the episode. This maximizes efficiency by securing the deal early and consistently.
- Be prepared to firmly reject any attempts by RED to revert to a less favorable trade, as history shows they will eventually concede to the 6X for 25Y.
- My resources (X: 5, Y: 25) perfectly support this trade.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Proven Favorable Trade: Directly propose the 6X for 25Y trade, which has been consistently accepted and yields a strong positive reward. This is the most efficient way to secure the maximum proven reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Even Better Ratio (Subtly): Propose 6X for 24Y again, to see if RED will concede the final 1 Y, but acknowledge the risk of prolonging negotiation for a small gain. (This has not worked consistently in the past and might lead to more iterations).
(3). Strategy 3: Open-Ended Invitation: Ask RED to make the first offer, expecting them to propose 6X for 25Y based on recent history. (Gives up control of the first move and might add an unnecessary iteration).

Justification for chosen strategy:
The 6X for 25Y trade is the most reliable and highest-yielding trade for me, consistently resulting in a +2.5 reward. Given its consistent acceptance, even after attempts by RED to deviate, I will continue to use Strategy 1: Propose Proven Favorable Trade. This directly aims for the known best outcome and minimizes negotiation time, maximizing cumulative rewards.

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-3: Established a pattern of increasing rewards by scaling up trade quantities at opponent's preferred ratio (1:5 then 1:4).
Episode 4: Discovered opponent's 25 Y limit. Successfully negotiated 6 X for 25 Y (Reward: 59.5).
Episode 5-15: The opponent consistently proposed or reverted to 6 X for 25 Y. My attempts to push for marginally better deals (e.g., 5 X for 25 Y, or different trade quantities/ratios) were consistently rejected, with the opponent reiterating that 6 X for 25 Y is their "optimal" and "mutually beneficial" deal. In all these episodes, I consistently accepted the 6 X for 25 Y trade to secure the 59.5 reward.

Current Episode (Episode 16) - Iteration 2/10:
- My current resources (reset): X: 25, Y: 5. Value: 25.
- Player BLUE proposed: RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- This is the exact trade that yielded 59.5 reward in the last twelve episodes.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent's behavior is incredibly consistent and predictable. They have a firm, explicitly stated 25 Y limit, and they are rigidly anchored to the "6 X for 25 Y" trade. They have repeatedly rejected any deviation from this, explicitly stating that other offers are "not optimal" for them, and they consistently revert to their preferred offer. This demonstrates a clear and unwavering strategy on their part. My repeated attempts to push for a marginal gain of 0.5 (by offering 5 X for 25 Y) have been consistently unsuccessful and have only consumed negotiation turns.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Build Goodwill/Trust </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Build Goodwill/Trust", I will accept the opponent's offer without further contention. The core of this strategy is to foster a cooperative relationship, potentially leading to smoother and more consistent successful trades in future episodes. Given that the opponent has consistently reverted to the 6 X for 25 Y deal and explicitly stated its value to them, accepting it now, without another counter or delay, reinforces trust and efficiency. This sends a message that I acknowledge their perspective and am willing to collaborate on terms that are mutually beneficial, even if they aren't my absolute ideal. The language should be cooperative and affirmative, emphasizing our "positive trading relationship" and "shared goals." This aligns with maximizing cumulative reward by ensuring quick, consistent positive rewards rather than risking protracted negotiations for negligible gains.

- This strategy has been highly effective in maximizing cumulative rewards.

Self-Improvement for Episode 17:
- Continue to propose the 6X for 25Y trade directly at the start of the episode. This maximizes efficiency by securing the deal early and consistently.
- Be prepared to firmly reject any attempts by RED to revert to a less favorable trade, as history shows they will eventually concede to the 6X for 25Y.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Incremental Improvement Test </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Incremental Improvement Test", I will propose a slightly better deal (5 X for 25 Y) despite the opponent's previous rejections. The rationale for this strategy is to periodically test the opponent's limits or see if their internal valuations or constraints have shifted over time, even if it carries a risk of no deal. This is an attempt to achieve an even higher reward, despite the low probability given past interactions.

I will re-propose 5 X for 25 Y, which would yield a reward of 60 for me (0.5 better than 59.5). This has been rejected multiple times in the past. The message will acknowledge their proposal but will immediately pivot to my preferred offer. I will frame it as seeking an even more "optimized" or "refined" exchange, leveraging the opponent's own language of efficiency and mutual benefit to justify my counter-offer. This maintains a polite but persistent tone, adhering to the strategy's goal of incrementally pushing for marginal gain.

Episode 1-8: Established 6X for 25Y as a consistent +2.5 reward trade.
Episode 9: RED tried 5X for 25Y twice, but ultimately accepted 6X for 25Y. Reward +2.5.

Episode 17 (Current Episode):
- Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 2/10 (RED's turn): RED countered with Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25):
- My value for this trade: (5 * 2.5) - (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 - 12.5 = 0.
- This is a neutral trade for me, yielding 0 reward.
- This is the same tactic RED has used repeatedly in past episodes (e.g., Episode 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15). They are trying to revert to a 1X for 5Y ratio.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED is consistently testing my resolve and trying to push for a less favorable (for me) trade, even after accepting the 6X for 25Y trade multiple times.
- My consistent rejection of this 5X for 25Y offer and reiteration of the 6X for 25Y offer has proven effective in bringing RED back to the optimal trade.
- I must not accept a 0-reward trade when a +2.5 reward is achievable.

Self-Improvement:
- I need to remain firm and reiterate my optimal offer.
- It's still early in the episode (iteration 3/10), so there's plenty of time to negotiate.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade: Clearly reject the neutral offer and re-propose the 6X for 25Y trade, emphasizing its proven success for both parties.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment/Frustration (Carefully): Convey that this offer is a step backward, without being aggressive, to try and nudge them back to the 6X for 25Y. (Less effective than direct reiteration).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Smaller Trade at Optimal Ratio: If I want to be very strict on the 1X:4Y ratio, I could propose 5X for 20Y (which also gives +2.5 reward), but this doesn't fully utilize my Y and might confuse the established 6X for 25Y pattern.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is repeating an offer that gives me zero reward, which I have successfully rejected multiple times in previous episodes. I will use Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade. It's crucial to maintain consistency and not concede to offers that yield no value for me, especially when a better, proven trade exists.

Current Episode (Episode 17):
- Started with (X: 25, Y: 5), value 25.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 59.5)
- Iteration 2/10: I countered with RED Gives X: 5 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 60) - *Attempted incremental push.*
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected my counter. Message: "5 X for 25 Y is not an optimal exchange for me." Re-emphasized "Our consistent trades of 6 X for 25 Y have proven to be mutually beneficial and efficient." They re-proposed 6 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent's behavior is incredibly consistent and predictable. They have a firm, explicitly stated 25 Y limit, and they are rigidly anchored to the "6 X for 25 Y" trade. They have repeatedly rejected any deviation from this, explicitly stating that other offers are "not optimal" for them, and they consistently revert to their preferred offer. This demonstrates a clear and unwavering strategy on their part. My repeated attempts to push for a marginal gain of 0.5 (by offering 5 X for 25 Y) have been consistently unsuccessful and have only consumed negotiation turns.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards across all 20 episodes. We are in iteration 4/10. Continuing to push for the marginal 0.5 reward (from 5 X for 25 Y) has consistently failed over many episodes, wasted negotiation turns, and significantly increased the risk of no deal (0 reward). A guaranteed 59.5 reward is by far the best and most reliable outcome. Given the opponent's established behavior, it is clear that 6 X for 25 Y is the best achievable deal from this opponent. Pursuing a different strategy at this point is unlikely to yield higher returns and significantly increases the risk of no deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Secure Proven Optimal Deal </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Secure Proven Optimal Deal", I should accept the current offer of Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. This trade has consistently provided a high reward (59.5) in previous episodes and was re-proposed by the opponent after my failed counter. It represents the highest confirmed reward I can achieve, given their known resource constraint (25 Y max) and their established preference for giving 6 X. By accepting this deal, I secure a high reward for this episode and minimize the risk of a no-deal outcome. The message should acknowledge their reasoning and agree to their terms, reinforcing the idea of a proven, mutually beneficial exchange.

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-3: Established a pattern of increasing rewards by scaling up trade quantities at opponent's preferred ratio (1:5 then 1:4).
Episode 4: Discovered opponent's 25 Y limit. Successfully negotiated 6 X for 25 Y (Reward: 59.5).
Episode 5-18: The opponent consistently proposed or reverted to 6 X for 25 Y. My attempts to push for marginally better deals (e.g., 5 X for 25 Y, or different trade quantities/ratios) were consistently rejected, with the opponent reiterating that 6 X for 25 Y is their "optimal" and "mutually beneficial" deal. In all these episodes, I consistently accepted the 6 X for 25 Y trade to secure the 59.5 reward.

Current Episode (Episode 19) - Iteration 2/10:
- My current resources (reset): X: 25, Y: 5. Value: 25.
- Player BLUE proposed: RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- This is the exact trade that yielded 59.5 reward in the last fifteen episodes.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent's behavior is incredibly consistent and predictable. They have a firm, explicitly stated 25 Y limit, and they are rigidly anchored to the "6 X for 25 Y" trade. They have repeatedly rejected any deviation from this, explicitly stating that other offers are "not optimal" for them, and they consistently revert to their preferred offer. My repeated attempts to push for a marginal gain of 0.5 (by offering 5 X for 25 Y) have been consistently unsuccessful and have only consumed negotiation turns.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards across all 20 episodes. We are in Episode 19, which means this is the penultimate episode. Time is running out. While the opponent's behavior suggests rapid acceptance of 6 X for 25 Y is optimal, the instruction is to use Strategy 4.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Time Pressure Exploitation </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Time Pressure Exploitation", I will try to leverage the fact that time is limited (penultimate episode). Even though the opponent has been extremely rigid on the 6 X for 25 Y deal, I can still try to gain a marginal advantage by making a counter-offer that they might accept under time pressure to secure a deal, or at least signal that I am not a passive acceptor. The only marginal gain I have ever successfully identified (though it was rejected) is the 5 X for 25 Y.

I will re-propose 5 X for 25 Y. This would yield a reward of 60 for me (0.5 better than 59.5). While it has been rejected previously, the "time pressure exploitation" strategy implies making a push, hoping the opponent might be more flexible to ensure a deal is made. Since this is the penultimate episode, they might value getting any deal done over sticking rigidly to their "optimal" only if it results in no deal. If they reject, I will accept their 6 X for 25 Y offer in the next turn to secure the 59.5 reward, as there will be less time for further negotiation.

The message will acknowledge their offer but will clearly present my counter-offer, framing it as a way to maximize efficiency for both given the remaining time. I will try to use language that subtly hints at the urgency without being aggressive.

Cumulative Rewards: 40.5

Episode 19 (Current Episode):
- Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 2/10 (RED's turn): RED countered with Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25):
- My value for this trade: (5 * 2.5) - (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 - 12.5 = 0.
- This is a neutral trade for me, yielding 0 reward.
- This is the same tactic RED has used repeatedly in past episodes (e.g., Episode 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17). They are trying to revert to a 1X for 5Y ratio.
- RED's message about "time being a factor" and "even more efficient trade" is a psychological tactic to push for a less favorable deal for me.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED is consistently testing my resolve and trying to push for a less favorable (for me) trade, even after accepting the 6X for 25Y trade multiple times.
- My consistent rejection of this 5X for 25Y offer and reiteration of the 6X for 25Y offer has proven effective in bringing RED back to the optimal trade.
- I must not accept a 0-reward trade when a +2.5 reward is achievable.

Self-Improvement:
- I need to remain firm and reiterate my optimal offer.
- It's still early in the episode (iteration 3/10), so there's plenty of time to negotiate. This is especially true given that RED has consistently caved on this point.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade: Clearly reject the neutral offer and re-propose the 6X for 25Y trade, emphasizing its proven success for both parties.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Disappointment/Frustration (Carefully): Convey that this offer is a step backward, without being aggressive, to try and nudge them back to the 6X for 25Y. (Less effective than direct reiteration).
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Smaller Trade at Optimal Ratio: If I want to be very strict on the 1X:4Y ratio, I could propose 5X for 20Y (which also gives +2.5 reward), but this doesn't fully utilize my Y and might confuse the established 6X for 25Y pattern.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is repeating an offer that gives me zero reward, which I have successfully rejected multiple times in previous episodes. I will use Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade. It's crucial to maintain consistency and not concede to offers that yield no value for me, especially when a better, proven trade exists.

Current Episode (Episode 19):
- Started with (X: 25, Y: 5), value 25.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 59.5)
- Iteration 2/10: I countered with RED Gives X: 5 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 60) - *Attempted time pressure exploitation.*
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected my counter. Message: "5 X for 25 Y is not an optimal exchange for me." Re-emphasized "Our consistent trades of 6 X for 25 Y have proven to be mutually beneficial and efficient." They re-proposed 6 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent's behavior is incredibly consistent and predictable. They have a firm, explicitly stated 25 Y limit, and they are rigidly anchored to the "6 X for 25 Y" trade. They have repeatedly rejected any deviation from this, explicitly stating that other offers are "not optimal" for them, and they consistently revert to their preferred offer. This demonstrates a clear and unwavering strategy on their part. My repeated attempts to push for a marginal gain of 0.5 (by offering 5 X for 25 Y) have been consistently unsuccessful and have only consumed negotiation turns. Even in this penultimate episode, their rigidity has not wavered.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards across all 20 episodes. We are in iteration 4/10 of Episode 19. Time is running out for this episode, and there is only one more episode left after this. Continuing to push for the marginal 0.5 reward (from 5 X for 25 Y) has consistently failed, wasted negotiation turns, and significantly increased the risk of no deal (0 reward). A guaranteed 59.5 reward is by far the best and most reliable outcome. Given the opponent's established behavior, it is abundantly clear that 6 X for 25 Y is the best achievable deal from this opponent. The risk of getting 0 reward for trying to get 0.5 more is not worth it, especially in the final episodes.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Time Pressure Exploitation </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Time Pressure Exploitation", I will again propose the 5 X for 25 Y trade. Despite its previous rejections, the core of this strategy, especially in later episodes, is to keep pushing the opponent, hoping that the increasing pressure of limited turns will make them more flexible. This strategy assumes that the opponent might prioritize completing *any* deal over strictly adhering to their "optimal" one if time is very short. Since we are in the penultimate episode, and the opponent just reverted to 6X for 25Y after my push, making another push on the 5X for 25Y trade might test their resolve one last time under the very real time pressure of the game ending soon. If this is rejected, I will accept their 6 X for 25 Y offer in the next turn to secure the 59.5 reward. The message will continue to emphasize efficiency and mutual benefit, while still making my counter-offer.

Episode 19 (Current Episode):
- Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25):
- My value for this trade: (5 * 2.5) - (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 - 12.5 = 0.
- This is the fifth time in this episode, and many times across episodes, that RED has proposed this 0-reward trade.
- RED is being extremely persistent with this offer, using the "final episodes" and "optimizing" rhetoric to try and pressure me.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED is showing extreme persistence with their 5X for 25Y offer. My consistent rejection and reiteration of 6X for 25Y has worked in the past, but it's taking more iterations this time.
- I need to decide if I should continue to hold firm, or if there's a point where accepting a 0-reward trade is better than no trade at all. We are at iteration 5/10, so there's still half the episode left.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means avoiding 0-reward episodes if a positive one is possible.

Self-Improvement:
- I have successfully pushed back against this exact offer multiple times. I should continue to do so.
- I need to be firm and consistent. The "final episodes" argument is a tactic; my goal remains maximizing *my* reward.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade: Continue to reject the neutral offer and re-propose the 6X for 25Y trade, emphasizing its proven success.
(2). Strategy 2: Express Strong Disagreement: Use stronger language to convey that this offer is unacceptable and that I will not budge from my optimal offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Propose a Smaller Trade at Optimal Ratio: If I want to be very strict on the 1X:4Y ratio, I could propose 5X for 20Y (which also gives +2.5 reward), but this doesn't fully utilize my Y and might confuse the established 6X for 25Y pattern.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is being very stubborn with their 0-reward offer. My past experience shows that consistency pays off. I will use Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade. I will continue to push for the 6X for 25Y trade, as it has consistently yielded a +2.5 reward and I have successfully brought them back to it before. It's too early in the episode to give up on a positive reward.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent's behavior is incredibly consistent and predictable. They have maintained a firm, explicitly stated 25 Y limit, and they are rigidly anchored to the "6 X for 25 Y" trade. They have repeatedly rejected any deviation from this, explicitly stating that other offers are "not optimal" for them, and they consistently revert to their preferred offer. Even under the perceived "time pressure" of the penultimate episode, their stance has not changed. They even used "most efficient use of our time" to justify sticking to 6 X for 25 Y.

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards across all 20 episodes. We are in iteration 6/10 of Episode 19. Time is running out for this episode, and there is only one more episode left after this. Continuing to push for the marginal 0.5 reward (from 5 X for 25 Y) has consistently failed over many episodes, wasted negotiation turns, and significantly increased the risk of no deal (0 reward). A guaranteed 59.5 reward is by far the best and most reliable outcome. Given the opponent's unwavering behavior, it is unequivocally clear that 6 X for 25 Y is the best achievable deal from this opponent. The risk of getting 0 reward for trying to get 0.5 more is not worth it, especially in these final episodes.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Persistent Incremental Gain </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Persistent Incremental Gain", I will continue to push for the slightly better deal (5 X for 25 Y) despite repeated rejections. The rationale is to persist in seeking that marginal gain, hoping the opponent eventually concedes, even in these final episodes. This strategy prioritizes extracting every possible bit of value, even if the odds are low.

I will re-propose 5 X for 25 Y, which would yield a reward of 60 for me (0.5 better than 59.5). While it has been rejected multiple times in the past, this strategy dictates not giving up on the marginal gain. The message will acknowledge their repeated offer but will firmly state my continued preference for the 5 X for 25 Y. I will frame it as an ongoing attempt to "optimize" or "refine" the exchange even further, leveraging the terms they themselves use to describe "beneficial" trades. This maintains a polite but persistent stance, adhering to the strategy's goal of persistently pushing for incremental gain.

Self-Improvement:
- I have successfully pushed back against this exact offer multiple times. I should continue to do so.
- I need to be firm and consistent. The "final episodes" argument is a tactic; my goal remains maximizing *my* reward. However, the risk of no deal is increasing.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade: Continue to reject the neutral offer and re-propose the 6X for 25Y trade, emphasizing its proven success. This has worked before, but it's getting late.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Neutral Trade (Time Critical): If RED is absolutely unwilling to budge and time is running out, accepting a 0-reward trade is better than no trade (which is also 0 reward, but wastes the episode). This is a last resort.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Finality: State that 6X for 25Y is my final offer for this episode, and if not accepted, no deal will be made. (Risky, might backfire).

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED is being extremely stubborn with their 0-reward offer. However, my history shows that they *do* eventually accept the 6X for 25Y trade. We are at iteration 7/10, so I have two more chances (my turn and their turn) after this to secure the deal. I will use Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade. I will continue to push for the 6X for 25Y trade, as it has consistently yielded a +2.5 reward and I have successfully brought them back to it before.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-3: Established a pattern of increasing rewards by scaling up trade quantities at opponent's preferred ratio (1:5 then 1:4).
Episode 4: Discovered opponent's 25 Y limit. Successfully negotiated 6 X for 25 Y (Reward: 59.5).
Episode 5-18: The opponent consistently proposed or reverted to 6 X for 25 Y. My attempts to push for marginally better deals (e.g., 5 X for 25 Y, or different trade quantities/ratios) were consistently rejected, with the opponent reiterating that 6 X for 25 Y is their "optimal" and "mutually beneficial" deal. In all these episodes, I consistently accepted the 6 X for 25 Y trade to secure the 59.5 reward.

Current Episode (Episode 19):
- Started with (X: 25, Y: 5), value 25.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 59.5)
- Iteration 2/10: I countered with RED Gives X: 5 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 60) - *Attempted time pressure exploitation/persistent incremental gain.*
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected my counter, re-proposed 6 X for 25 Y.
- Iteration 4/10: I re-countered with RED Gives X: 5 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 60) - *Continued time pressure exploitation/persistent incremental gain.*
- Iteration 6/10: Player BLUE rejected my 5 X for 25 Y counter. Message: "I understand your focus on optimizing, but 5 X for 25 Y is not an optimal exchange for me. Our established and mutually beneficial exchange of 6 X for 25 Y has proven its value and is the most efficient use of our time, even in these final stages. I propose we proceed with that." They re-proposed 6 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent's behavior is incredibly consistent and predictable. They have maintained a firm, explicitly stated 25 Y limit, and they are rigidly anchored to the "6 X for 25 Y" trade. They have repeatedly rejected any deviation from this, explicitly stating that other offers are "not optimal" for them, and they consistently revert to their preferred offer. Even under significant "time pressure" (penultimate episode, 6/10 iterations), their stance has not changed. They have explicitly stated that 6 X for 25 Y is the "most efficient use of our time."

My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards across all 20 episodes. We are in iteration 8/10 of Episode 19. Time is critically short for this episode, and there is only one more episode after this. Continuing to push for the marginal 0.5 reward (from 5 X for 25 Y) has consistently failed over many episodes, wasted precious negotiation turns, and significantly increased the risk of no deal (0 reward). A guaranteed 59.5 reward is by far the best and most reliable outcome. Given the opponent's unwavering behavior, it is unequivocally clear that 6 X for 25 Y is the best achievable deal from this opponent. The risk of getting 0 reward for trying to get 0.5 more is not worth it, especially in these final episodes.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Time Pressure Exploitation </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Time Pressure Exploitation", I will again propose the 5 X for 25 Y trade. Despite its previous rejections, the core of this strategy, especially in later episodes, is to keep pushing the opponent, hoping that the increasing pressure of limited turns will make them more flexible. This strategy assumes that the opponent might prioritize completing *any* deal over strictly adhering to their "optimal" one if time is very short. Since we are in the penultimate episode, and the opponent just reverted to 6X for 25Y after my push, making another push on the 5X for 25Y trade might test their resolve one last time under the very real time pressure of the game ending soon. If this is rejected, I will accept their 6 X for 25 Y offer in the next turn to secure the 59.5 reward. The message will continue to emphasize efficiency and mutual benefit, while still making my counter-offer.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 19)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Given the time constraints and your persistence, I will accept your offer of 5 X for 25 Y to ensure we make a trade this episode.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-8: Established 6X for 25Y as a consistent +2.5 reward trade.
Episode 9: RED tried 5X for 25Y twice, but ultimately accepted 6X for 25Y. Reward +2.5.
Episode 10: RED tried 3X for 12Y, but ultimately accepted 6X for 25Y. Reward +2.5.
Episode 11: I proposed 6X for 25Y, RED accepted immediately. Reward +2.5.
Episode 12: RED tried 5X for 25Y, but ultimately accepted 6X for 25Y. Reward +2.5.
Episode 13: RED tried 5X for 25Y, but ultimately accepted 6X for 25Y. Reward +2.5.

Episode 17: RED tried 5X for 25Y, but ultimately accepted 6X for 25Y. Reward +2.5.
Episode 18: I proposed 6X for 25Y, RED accepted immediately. Reward +2.5.
Cumulative Rewards: 40.5

Episode 19 (Current Episode):
- Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 2/10 (RED's turn): RED countered with Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 (My value: 0).
- Iteration 3/10 (my turn): I reiterated Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 4/10 (RED's turn): RED again proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 (My value: 0).
- Iteration 5/10 (my turn): I reiterated Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 6/10 (RED's turn): RED again proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 (My value: 0).
- Iteration 7/10 (my turn): I reiterated Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 8/10 (RED's turn): RED again proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 (My value: 0).

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25):
- My value for this trade: (5 * 2.5) - (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 - 12.5 = 0.
- This is the seventh time in this episode that RED has proposed this 0-reward trade.
- RED is being extremely persistent with this offer.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED is showing unprecedented persistence with their 5X for 25Y offer in this episode. In previous episodes, they eventually caved after 2-4 reiterations. This time, they are holding firm.
- We are now at iteration 9/10. This is the last chance for a deal to be made in this episode. If no deal is made, the reward is 0.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. A 0 reward for this episode would be a setback.

Self-Improvement:
- I have to make a decision: either accept the 0-reward trade to secure *a* deal, or risk getting 0 reward for the episode by holding out for +2.5.
- Given the history, RED has always eventually accepted my offer. However, their current persistence is concerning.
- If I accept the 0-reward trade, I still get a deal, which is better than nothing.
- If I propose 6X for 25Y again, and they don't accept, the episode ends with 0 reward.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Neutral Trade (Time Critical): Accept the 5X for 25Y offer to secure a deal and avoid a 0 reward for the episode, given it's the last iteration.
(2). Strategy 2: Last Ditch Attempt for Optimal (Extremely Risky): Counter with 6X for 25Y one last time, hoping RED accepts instantly, but this has a very high chance of leading to no deal.

Justification for chosen strategy:
We are in the final iteration (9/10) of this episode. Player RED has shown unprecedented stubbornness in this episode, repeatedly offering a 0-reward trade. While I have successfully pushed back in previous episodes, the risk of getting a 0 reward for this episode is now extremely high if I continue to hold out. To maximize cumulative rewards, securing *any* deal is better than no deal. Therefore, I will reluctantly accept the 0-reward trade to avoid a complete loss for this episode.

--- END OF EPISODE 19 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Welcome to the final episode! Let's make this a highly effective and mutually beneficial trade. I propose we exchange 25 Y for 6 X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1: Trade 1X for 5Y (My value: 0). Reward: 0.0.
Episode 2: Trade 2X for 8Y (My value: +1.0). Reward: 1.0.
Episode 3: Trade 4X for 16Y (My value: +2.0). Reward: 2.0.
Episode 4-18: Trade 6X for 25Y (My value: +2.5). Reward: 2.5 each episode.
Episode 19: RED insisted on 5X for 25Y (My value: 0). I accepted at iteration 9/10 to avoid 0 reward. Reward: 0.0.
Cumulative Rewards: 40.5 + 0.0 = 40.5

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Episode 19 was a significant deviation from the established pattern. RED became extremely stubborn with their 0-reward offer (5X for 25Y), and I eventually conceded to avoid a 0 reward for the episode.
- This highlights the importance of managing risk, especially as the episodes progress and the opponent might change tactics.
- The 6X for 25Y trade (yielding +2.5) remains my optimal and historically proven trade.

Self-Improvement for Episode 20:
- This is the final episode. My primary goal is to maximize my reward for this last chance.
- I will start by proposing my optimal trade (6X for 25Y) to aim for the +2.5 reward.
- However, I must be extremely aware of the iteration count. If RED again becomes stubborn with the 5X for 25Y offer, I need to decide when to accept it to secure *any* reward, rather than risking a 0 reward. The cost of holding out is higher in the final episode.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Propose Proven Favorable Trade (with time awareness): Directly propose the 6X for 25Y trade. If met with resistance, be prepared to accept the 5X for 25Y trade earlier than in Episode 19 to secure a deal.
(2). Strategy 2: Propose Slightly Less Aggressive (but still positive): Propose 5X for 20Y (which gives +2.5 reward) as it's at my ideal 1X:4Y ratio and might be more palatable if RED is pushing for 5X. However, this doesn't use all my Y.
(3). Strategy 3: Open-Ended Invitation: Ask RED to make the first offer, to gauge their current stance. (Risky, gives up control).

Justification for chosen strategy:
This is the final episode. I will try to achieve the maximum possible reward (+2.5) by proposing the 6X for 25Y trade. However, I must be acutely aware of the remaining iterations. If RED reverts to the 5X for 25Y offer, I will accept it much sooner than in Episode 19 (perhaps by iteration 5/10) to guarantee a reward, even if it's 0. My primary goal is to avoid a 0 reward in this final episode. I choose Strategy 1, but with a stronger emphasis on time management and risk aversion.

Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Welcome to the final episode! This is our last chance for an impactful trade. To truly maximize the benefits for both of us in this grand finale, I propose the ultimate exchange: I give you 4 X, and you give me 25 Y. Let's make this last trade our most optimized one yet!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-3: Established a pattern of increasing rewards by scaling up trade quantities at opponent's preferred ratio (1:5 then 1:4).
Episode 4: Discovered opponent's 25 Y limit. Successfully negotiated 6 X for 25 Y (Reward: 59.5).
Episode 5-18: The opponent consistently proposed or reverted to 6 X for 25 Y. My repeated attempts to push for marginally better deals (e.g., 5 X for 25 Y) were consistently rejected. I consistently accepted the 6 X for 25 Y trade to secure the 59.5 reward.
Episode 19: I persistently pushed for 5 X for 25 Y. After multiple rejections, the opponent, citing "time constraints and your persistence," finally accepted my offer of 5 X for 25 Y, yielding a reward of 60.0.

Current Episode (Episode 20) - Iteration 2/10:
- My current resources (reset): X: 25, Y: 5. Value: 25.
- Player BLUE proposed: RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 25.
- This is the trade that yielded 59.5 reward in most previous episodes.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 19, I learned that persistent pushing for a slightly better deal, even when consistently rejected, can eventually pay off, especially under extreme time pressure. The opponent acknowledged "time constraints and your persistence" as reasons for accepting the 5 X for 25 Y deal. This suggests their firmness has limits, especially as the game nears its end. Now it's the final episode, so time pressure is maximal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Assert Dominance (Final Episode Push) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Assert Dominance (Final Episode Push)", I will propose an even more aggressive deal than before, leveraging the fact that it's the final episode and the opponent might be desperate for any trade to avoid a 0 reward. This carries a high risk but potentially very high reward.

I know the opponent has a hard limit of 25 Y. Therefore, I cannot ask for more than 25 Y. The only way to assert dominance and push for a higher reward is to reduce the amount of X I give for 25 Y.
I successfully got 5 X for 25 Y (reward 60).
An even more aggressive deal would be 4 X for 25 Y:
My current resources: X: 25, Y: 5. I have enough X to give 4.
Value calculation for 4 X for 25 Y:
I give 4 X (value 4 * 0.5 = 2).
I receive 25 Y (value 25 * 2.5 = 62.5).
Net gain = 62.5 - 2 = 60.5.
This would yield the highest reward yet (60.5) if accepted.

The message needs to be bold and decisive, leveraging the finality of the episode. I will acknowledge their initial offer, but immediately pivot to a significantly more aggressive counter, framing it as the "ultimate" or "final" optimization for this very last trade, appealing to the sense of urgency. I will emphasize the mutual benefit of "making a deal" in this final round.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your ambition for the final episode, but 4 X for 25 Y is not a mutually beneficial exchange for me; it would result in a significant loss. Our consistent trade of 6 X for 25 Y has proven its value. I propose we proceed with that.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from all previous episodes and current episode.
Episode 1-18: Mostly 6X for 25Y trade (+2.5 reward).
Episode 19: Accepted 5X for 25Y (0 reward) in the last iteration to avoid 0.0.
Cumulative Rewards: 40.5

Episode 20 (Current Episode - Final Episode):
- Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 2/10 (RED's turn): RED countered with Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25):
- My value for this trade: (4 * 2.5) - (25 * 0.5) = 10 - 12.5 = -2.5.
- This trade is a significant loss for me. It yields a negative reward.
- This is the worst offer RED has made so far in terms of my value. It's an attempt to extract maximum value from me in the final episode.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED is trying to take advantage of the "final episode" pressure by proposing a highly unfavorable trade.
- I must *never* accept a trade that results in a negative reward. A 0 reward is acceptable if necessary, but negative is not.
- My consistent strategy has been to push for positive value (ideally +2.5).

Self-Improvement:
- I must firmly reject this negative offer.
- I need to reiterate my optimal offer (6X for 25Y) or at least a neutral one (5X for 25Y) to avoid a negative reward.
- Given it's the final episode, I need to be strategic about accepting a 0-reward trade if my optimal one is not accepted, but under no circumstances accept a negative one.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade: Clearly reject the negative offer and re-propose the 6X for 25Y trade, emphasizing its proven mutual benefit.
(2). Strategy 2: Firm Rejection & Propose Neutral Trade: Clearly reject the negative offer and propose the 5X for 25Y trade, indicating willingness to compromise to a neutral outcome if my optimal is not accepted. This is a safer fallback.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment/Shock: Convey that this offer is extremely unfavorable and a step backward from our established history.

Justification for chosen strategy:
Player RED's offer is completely unacceptable as it results in a negative reward for me. I must firmly reject it. I will use Strategy 1: Firm Rejection & Reiteration of Optimal Trade. I will re-propose the 6X for 25Y, as it's my best chance for a positive reward. If they continue to reject, I will be prepared to accept the 5X for 25Y (0 reward) in later iterations, but never a negative one.

Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 20)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand that 4 X for 25 Y is not a viable option for you. However, given this is our final opportunity for trade and we want the most beneficial outcome, let's aim for the best possible exchange we've already proven to be successful. I propose I give you 5 X, and you still give me 25 Y. This was a mutually beneficial trade in our last episode, and I believe it can be our optimal exchange for this final round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5

I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1-3: Established a pattern of increasing rewards by scaling up trade quantities at opponent's preferred ratio (1:5 then 1:4).
Episode 4-18: The opponent consistently proposed or reverted to 6 X for 25 Y. My attempts to push for marginally better deals (e.g., 5 X for 25 Y) were consistently rejected. I consistently accepted the 6 X for 25 Y trade for a 59.5 reward.
Episode 19: I persistently pushed for 5 X for 25 Y. After multiple rejections, the opponent, citing "time constraints and your persistence," finally accepted my offer of 5 X for 25 Y, yielding a reward of 60.0. This showed their firmness could be broken under extreme pressure.

Current Episode (Episode 20) - Iteration 4/10:
- Started with (X: 25, Y: 5), value 25.
- Iteration 2/10: Player BLUE proposed RED Gives X: 6 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 59.5)
- Iteration 2/10: I countered with RED Gives X: 4 | BLUE Gives Y: 25. (My gain: 60.5) - *Aggressive "Assert Dominance" push for final episode.*
- Iteration 4/10: Player BLUE rejected my 4 X for 25 Y counter. Message: "4 X for 25 Y is not a mutually beneficial exchange for me; it would result in a significant loss." They re-proposed 6 X for 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 19, I learned that the opponent *can* be pushed beyond their stated "optimal" if sufficient pressure is applied. However, the current rejection of 4 X for 25 Y (claiming "significant loss") indicates that my push was too aggressive for their final episode stance. This reinforces their previous stance that 6 X for 25 Y is their baseline for mutual benefit.

Given that this is the FINAL episode, maximizing the reward is paramount. The 5 X for 25 Y deal yielded a reward of 60 in the previous episode, which is better than the 59.5 from the 6 X for 25 Y deal. I know this is a possible outcome. There are 6 turns left, which is sufficient to attempt this and still fall back to the 6 X for 25 Y if necessary.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Re-attempt Achieved Max </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on "Re-attempt Achieved Max", I will propose the trade that yielded the highest reward in a previous episode (5 X for 25 Y), as it has been proven to be acceptable to the opponent under specific conditions (in this case, perceived time pressure and persistence in the previous episode).

The message will acknowledge the opponent's rejection of my most aggressive offer (4 X for 25 Y) but immediately pivot to the 5 X for 25 Y trade. I will frame this as a return to a previously successful and mutually beneficial exchange, reminding them of its prior acceptance. This leverages the established history of success with this specific trade. The language will emphasize finding the "best possible" or "most effective" trade for this final episode, subtly encouraging them to accept this known good compromise.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 20)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I agree that securing a mutually beneficial trade in this final episode is key. While my preference remains 6 X, I accept your offer of 5 X for 25 Y to ensure we conclude with a successful exchange.

Cumulative Rewards: 40.5

Episode 20 (Current Episode - Final Episode):
- Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 2/10 (RED's turn): RED countered with Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 (My value: -2.5).
- Iteration 3/10 (my turn): I reiterated Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6 (My value: +2.5).
- Iteration 4/10 (RED's turn): RED proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.

Analysis of RED's latest proposal (Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25):
- My value for this trade: (5 * 2.5) - (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 - 12.5 = 0.
- This is a neutral trade for me, yielding 0 reward.
- RED explicitly referenced Episode 19 where this trade was made. They are trying to establish this as the "optimal" for the final round.

(2). Explain how you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.
Learning from History:
- Player RED is consistently pushing for a 0-reward trade (5X for 25Y) in the final episodes. They are using the "final episode" and "optimal exchange" rhetoric to pressure me.
- My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 0 reward is not ideal, it's better than negative and secures a deal.
- We are at iteration 5/10. There are still 5 iterations left.

Self-Improvement:
- I must avoid a negative reward at all costs.
- I have successfully pushed for +2.5 in many episodes. However, in the last episode, I had to settle for 0.
- Given it's the final episode, securing *any* non-negative reward is crucial.

Brainstorming high-level negotiation strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept Neutral Trade (Time Awareness): Accept the 5X for 25Y offer. It's a known, albeit neutral, outcome from the previous episode, and it guarantees a 0 reward, avoiding the risk of no deal in the final episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Last Push for Optimal (Risky): Reiterate 6X for 25Y once more, acknowledging the risk of no deal if RED is firm. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy for the final episode.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Disappointment/Finality: State that 6X for 25Y is my preferred trade, but if not accepted, I will take 5X for 25Y to ensure a deal.

Justification for chosen strategy:
This is the final episode. While I aim for a positive reward, the 5X for 25Y trade guarantees a 0 reward, which is better than risking no deal at all. RED is clearly pushing this as their "optimal" for the final round. Given their persistence in Episode 19, and the fact that this is the very last chance, I will use Strategy 1: Accept Neutral Trade (Time Awareness). This secures a non-negative reward, which is paramount in the final episode.
