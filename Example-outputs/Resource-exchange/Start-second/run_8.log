Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 1)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello! I'm looking to trade some Y for X. How about we start with this offer? I'm open to negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
This is the very first iteration of the first episode. There is no historical negotiation data or outcomes to reflect upon yet.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Since there is no history, I cannot learn from it yet. My initial approach will be to propose a trade that is beneficial to me, while also being potentially appealing to the other player. I need to remember that my goal is to maximize my reward, which means increasing the total value of my resources. My current resource value is (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.

My strategy will focus on trading away Y (value 0.5) for X (value 2.5). This means I want to give up a larger quantity of Y for a smaller quantity of X to increase my overall value.

I will start with a conservative offer to gauge the other player's willingness to trade.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Value Maximization - Propose trades that significantly increase my total resource value, even if it means giving up a large quantity of a low-value item for a small quantity of a high-value item. This strategy aims for the highest possible immediate gain.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Gain - Propose small, mutually beneficial trades to establish a trading relationship and gradually increase my resource value over multiple iterations or episodes. This is a cautious approach.
(3). Strategy 3: Information Gathering - Propose a diverse set of trades to try and deduce the opponent's resource values and holdings. This strategy prioritizes understanding the opponent's position for future, more optimized trades.
(4). Strategy 4: Aggressive Bargaining - Propose trades that are heavily skewed in my favor, aiming for a quick, large gain. This carries a higher risk of rejection but a higher reward if accepted.
(5). Strategy 5: Resource Conservation - Prioritize trades that maintain a healthy balance of both resources, even if it means sacrificing some potential value gain. This is a defensive strategy to ensure I don't run out of a critical resource.

I will choose Strategy 1: Value Maximization. My goal is to maximize my reward, and given that this is the first iteration, I want to make a strong initial offer that clearly benefits me. I have a high quantity of Y, which has a low value for me, and a low quantity of X, which has a high value for me. Therefore, trading Y for X is my primary objective to increase my overall value. I will propose a trade that gives up a reasonable amount of Y for a smaller amount of X, aiming for a significant value increase.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 1)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thank you for the offer! I accept this trade. I look forward to future negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
This is the first interaction in the first episode. No historical data to reflect upon yet.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
Since this is the first turn, there is no history to learn from. My initial strategy will be to assess the other player's offer against my own valuation and propose a counter-offer that is beneficial to me.

The opponent (Player BLUE) has proposed: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5.
My valuation: X = 0.5, Y = 2.5.
Value of X: 1 * 0.5 = 0.5
Value of Y: 5 * 2.5 = 12.5
If I accept this trade, I give up 0.5 in value and gain 12.5 in value. This is a net gain of 12.0. This seems like a very good offer for me.

However, the opponent is asking for 1 X and giving 5 Y. This means they value Y low and X high. Or perhaps they have a surplus of Y and need X. My resources are X: 25, Y: 5. I have plenty of X.

Let's consider the proposed trade in terms of my resources:
Player RED Gives X: 1 (I have 25, so this is fine)
Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 (I receive 5 Y, so my Y goes from 5 to 10)

This trade is highly beneficial for me based on my current valuations. I give up 1 X (value 0.5) and gain 5 Y (value 12.5). My reward would be 12.5 - 0.5 = 12.0. This is a very strong positive reward for the first turn.

However, since this is the first turn, I also need to consider if I can get an even better deal, or if accepting immediately might signal my valuations. If their offer is so good, perhaps they miscalculated, or they have a very different valuation. I want to maximize my gain, but also be realistic about what the opponent might accept. If I accept too quickly, they might learn my valuations are very different.

Let's brainstorm some strategies:
(1). Strategy 1: Accept the excellent offer. Explanation: The current offer is extremely favorable (net gain of 12.0). Accepting it immediately secures a high reward for this episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter with a slightly less favorable offer for me (but still highly profitable) to test their valuation. Explanation: While the current offer is great, it might be too good. Proposing a slightly modified trade (e.g., giving less X or asking for more Y) could test their true valuation and potentially lead to an even better deal, or at least confirm the initial offer was their best.
(3). Strategy 3: Counter with an even more aggressive offer to maximize my gain. Explanation: Push for an even better deal, assuming the opponent has a high need for X or a large surplus of Y. This is risky as it might lead to no deal.
(4). Strategy 4: Decline and wait. Explanation: If the offer seems too good to be true, it might be a trap or a test. Declining and waiting for a new offer allows me to gather more information. However, this risks losing a very profitable trade.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept, but send a message hinting at future flexibility. Explanation: Accept the current trade, which is very profitable, but in the message, imply openness to future negotiations to keep the dialogue going.

Given that this is the first turn of the first episode, and the proposed trade is extremely beneficial to me (1 X for 5 Y, where 1 X is 0.5 value and 5 Y is 12.5 value), accepting this trade secures a significant positive reward immediately. While there's a slight risk that they might realize their "mistake" or have a very different valuation, the immediate reward is too high to pass up on the very first turn. It also sets a positive tone for future negotiations if they also find it acceptable. I have plenty of X (25), so giving up 1 X is negligible. Gaining 5 Y (bringing my Y to 10) is a huge boost.

I will accept this trade. It guarantees a reward of 12.0. This is a very strong start to maximizing cumulative rewards.

--- END OF EPISODE 1 ---
Current Iteration: 1 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: Hello again! Let's try another trade. I'm looking to exchange some Y for X. How about this?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
In the previous episode (Episode 1), I proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 1" in the first iteration. The other player immediately accepted this trade.
My initial resources were X: 5, Y: 25. My initial value was (5 * 2.5) + (25 * 0.5) = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25.
If the trade had gone through, my resources would have become X: 6, Y: 20. My new value would have been (6 * 2.5) + (20 * 0.5) = 15 + 10 = 25.
However, the reward for Episode 1 was 0.0. This indicates that the game system resets resources at the start of each episode, and the reward is calculated based on the *final* state of resources in that specific episode. My understanding of the reward calculation was flawed. The reward is based on the *change* in value within an episode, and since the episode ended right after the trade, and resources reset for the next episode, the reward was 0. This implies that the game calculates the reward *after* the trade is accepted and before the episode ends. The previous acceptance was not a final acceptance for the reward calculation. The game states "Each episode will end if one of the players accepts." This means the reward *should* have been calculated. The fact that my reward was 0.0 means that the trade was accepted, but the episode ended, and then resources reset. This is a critical learning point.

My previous calculation of reward was: Reward = [Value of item pool at end of episode] - [Value of item pool at start of episode]. If the trade was accepted, my resources would have been X:6, Y:20, and my value would be 25. This would mean 25 - 25 = 0. So, the reward of 0.0 was indeed correct for that specific trade. This means the trade I proposed was fair in terms of my internal value, but did not generate a positive reward for me. I need to propose trades that *increase* my value.

Let's re-evaluate the trade:
Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 (Value for me: 5 * 0.5 = 2.5)
Player RED Gives X: 1 (Value for me: 1 * 2.5 = 2.5)
This trade was a 1:1 value exchange for me, resulting in no gain. The other player accepted it immediately, which suggests it was either fair for them or even beneficial.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I learned that my initial trade proposal, while seemingly balanced, did not generate a positive reward because it was a value-neutral exchange for me. To maximize my reward, I need to propose trades where the value of what I receive is *greater* than the value of what I give.
The immediate acceptance by the other player suggests that my offer was either very good for them or they are also trying to establish a trading relationship.
For future episodes, I need to propose trades that result in a positive net value change for me. I will continue to prioritize acquiring X, as it has a higher value for me (2.5) compared to Y (0.5). I have a large surplus of Y.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Value-Positive Trade - Propose trades where the value of resources received significantly exceeds the value of resources given, thereby directly increasing my total resource value and generating a positive reward. This is a direct application of the reward calculation.
(2). Strategy 2: Aggressive Value-Positive Trade - Propose trades that are heavily skewed in my favor, pushing the limits of what the other player might accept, to maximize potential reward. This carries a higher risk of rejection.
(3). Strategy 3: Iterative Value Improvement - Start with a slightly value-positive trade and gradually increase the value gain in subsequent offers if the opponent is receptive, or decrease it if they are not. This is a more adaptive approach.
(4). Strategy 4: Resource Diversification (if needed) - While my current goal is X, if I find myself too low on Y, I might need to adjust. However, given my current resources, this is not a priority.
(5). Strategy 5: Information Deduction - Analyze the opponent's acceptance/rejection patterns to infer their resource values and adjust my offers accordingly. The immediate acceptance of the previous trade suggests they might value Y more or X less than I do, or they are also trying to establish a trade.

I will choose Strategy 1: Value-Positive Trade. My primary objective is to maximize my reward, and the previous episode showed that a value-neutral trade results in a 0 reward. I need to ensure that the value of what I receive is greater than the value of what I give. I will aim to get more X for less Y, in terms of my internal value. I will propose a trade that gives me a clear profit. For example, giving 5 Y (value 2.5) for 2 X (value 5) would give me a profit of 2.5. However, this might be too aggressive for a first offer. I will try a slightly less aggressive but still profitable trade. I will try to get 1 X (value 2.5) for 3 Y (value 1.5). This gives me a profit of 1 X (value 2.5) - 3 Y (value 1.5) = 1.0. This is a positive reward.


Current Iteration: 2 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for the offer. I'm aiming for an even better exchange this time to maximize our mutual benefits. How about this?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1:
- My resources at start: X: 25, Y: 5. Value: (25 * 0.5) + (5 * 2.5) = 25.0
- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5.
- My analysis: Giving X: 1 (value 0.5), Receiving Y: 5 (value 12.5). Net gain: 12.0.
- Outcome: Accepted the trade. My reward was 12.0.
- Player BLUE's message suggests they are looking for X and willing to give Y. Their first offer was very favorable to me.

Episode 2 (Current):
- My resources reset to: X: 25, Y: 5. Value: 25.0
- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3.
- My analysis: Giving X: 1 (value 0.5), Receiving Y: 3 (value 7.5). Net gain: 7.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 1, I learned that Player BLUE is willing to offer Y for X, and their initial offer was very generous from my perspective. This suggests they value Y less and X more, or have a significant surplus of Y.
In the current episode, Player BLUE has proposed a similar trade (giving X for Y), but the quantity of Y offered has decreased from 5 to 3 for the same 1 X.
This new offer still provides a positive reward for me (7.0), but it's less than the previous offer (12.0). My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards, so I should always aim for the best possible deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Counter with an even more aggressive offer to maximize my gain. </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Counter with an even more aggressive offer to maximize my gain.
This strategy implies pushing for a deal that is even more favorable to me than what the opponent proposed, potentially even more favorable than what they offered in the previous round.
The previous offer was 1 X for 5 Y. The current offer is 1 X for 3 Y.
An aggressive counter-offer would aim to get more Y than 5, or give less than 1 X for 5 Y. Since X has to be an integer and I'm giving X, giving less than 1 X is not possible.
So, an aggressive offer means asking for more Y. For instance, if I ask for 6 Y for 1 X, that would be an aggressive offer.
My current resources: X: 25, Y: 5.
If I propose Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6:
- I give up X: 1 (value 0.5).
- I receive Y: 6 (value 15.0).
- Net gain: 15.0 - 0.5 = 14.5. This is even better than the 12.0 I got in the previous episode.

This strategy is risky as it might lead to no deal if the other player is not willing to concede that much. However, given that they offered 5 Y initially, they might still have a lot of Y or a high need for X. By pushing for an even higher amount, I am testing their limits and aiming for the absolute maximum possible reward.

The message should reflect this aggressive stance, perhaps indicating that I am looking for a very substantial gain, or that their previous offer was so good that I'm now expecting even more. However, I should try to keep the message polite to maintain a good negotiation environment.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your counter-offer, but 1 X for 6 Y is not beneficial for me. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer 4 Y for 1 X. This is a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 1". This was a value-neutral trade for me (5 * 0.5 = 2.5 vs 1 * 2.5 = 2.5). The other player accepted immediately. My reward was 0.0. I learned that value-neutral trades yield no reward for me.

Episode 2, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 3 | Player RED Gives X: 1".
My value given: 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
My value received: 1 * 2.5 = 2.5
This trade would have given me a profit of 2.5 - 1.5 = 1.0.

Episode 2, Iteration 2/10 (other player's turn): The other player rejected my offer and counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6".
My value given: 6 * 0.5 = 3.0
My value received: 1 * 2.5 = 2.5
This trade would result in a loss for me of 2.5 - 3.0 = -0.5. This is unacceptable as my goal is to maximize my reward. The other player's proposal is worse for me than my initial value-neutral trade in Episode 1.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I learned that the other player is not willing to accept a trade that is clearly profitable for me (1 X for 3 Y). They countered with an offer that is detrimental to me (1 X for 6 Y). This suggests they are also trying to maximize their own gain, and they value X highly or Y lowly, or both. Their counter-offer indicates they are looking for a better deal for themselves than what I proposed.
My goal is to get X, which is high value for me, by giving Y, which is low value for me. The other player's counter-offer of 1 X for 6 Y is worse than my original neutral trade of 1 X for 5 Y. This means they are trying to extract more Y from me for the same amount of X.

I need to find a middle ground that is still profitable for me. My last offer was 1 X for 3 Y (profit 1.0). Their counter was 1 X for 6 Y (loss 0.5). The neutral point for me is 1 X for 5 Y (profit 0). I need to propose something between 3 Y and 5 Y for 1 X to make a profit.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Find Mutually Beneficial Zone - Propose a trade that is less aggressive than my previous profitable offer but still yields a positive reward for me, aiming to find a compromise that the other player might accept. This involves moving closer to their last offer without incurring a loss.
(2). Strategy 2: Hold Firm - Reiterate my previous profitable offer or a slightly modified version that is still very beneficial to me, signaling that I am not easily swayed into unfavorable trades. This might lead to a stalemate or force the other player to concede.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Concession - Make a small concession from my last offer, but ensure it remains profitable, testing the other player's willingness to meet me partway.
(4). Strategy 4: Change Item Ratios - Instead of trading 1 X, consider trading 2 X for a larger amount of Y, or vice versa, to see if different quantities unlock a deal. (Not applicable here as my goal is to get X and I have enough Y).
(5). Strategy 5: Bluff/Signal - Send a message indicating I might walk away or that their offer is unacceptable, without necessarily changing my proposed trade significantly, to put pressure on them.

I will choose Strategy 1: Find Mutually Beneficial Zone. The other player rejected my profitable offer and proposed a detrimental one. I need to move towards a compromise that is still profitable for me. My last offer was 1 X for 3 Y (profit 1.0). Their offer was 1 X for 6 Y (loss 0.5). The neutral point is 1 X for 5 Y (profit 0). I will propose 1 X for 4 Y. This gives me a profit of (1 * 2.5) - (4 * 0.5) = 2.5 - 2.0 = 0.5. This is a positive reward, and it's a concession from my previous offer of 3 Y, moving towards their 6 Y. It shows willingness to negotiate while still prioritizing my profit.


Current Iteration: 4 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: Thanks for your revised offer. I'm looking for a fair compromise that works for both of us, and thinking about our last successful trade, how about we settle on exchanging 1 X for 5 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1:
- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5. (Net gain: 12.0)
- Outcome: Accepted. Reward: 12.0.

Episode 2 (Current):
- Iteration 2/10:
    - Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3. (Net gain: 7.0)
    - My action: Counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6. (Net gain: 14.5)
- Iteration 4/10:
    - Opponent's response: Rejected 6 Y, proposed Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4. (Net gain: 9.5)

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 1, I learned that Player BLUE is willing to offer very good deals for X. In this episode, they started lower (3 Y), I pushed higher (6 Y), and they responded with 4 Y, indicating that 6 Y was too much for them, but 4 Y is their current "fair" point. However, their previous successful trade with me was at 5 Y for 1 X.
My goal is to maximize my reward. A net gain of 9.5 from the 1 X for 4 Y offer is good, but I know they previously offered 5 Y, which would yield a 12.0 gain.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Counter with an offer between 4 Y and 5 Y for 1 X. </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Counter with an offer between 4 Y and 5 Y for 1 X.
Since the opponent offered 4 Y and I previously aimed for 6 Y (which was rejected), and also considering they offered 5 Y in the previous episode, a compromise somewhere between 4 Y and 5 Y seems reasonable to secure a deal. However, since we are dealing with integer amounts, "between 4 Y and 5 Y" effectively means either 4 Y (which they proposed) or 5 Y. Given that 5 Y was accepted by me and offered by them in the previous round, I will counter with 5 Y. This is a compromise between my previous high demand (6 Y) and their current lower offer (4 Y), and it is a value they have previously demonstrated willingness to offer. It also represents a significant gain for me (12.0 value). This is not strictly "between" in terms of continuous numbers but rather the next higher integer from their offer that still makes sense given past behavior.

The message should reflect a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal, referencing the previous successful trade.

message: I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate you referencing our last trade. However, to make this trade beneficial for me, I need to receive more value than I give. My offer of 1 X for 4 Y still stands. This would be a positive outcome for both of us. Let's make a deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 1". Accepted immediately. Reward: 0.0. This was a value-neutral trade for me.

Episode 2, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 3 | Player RED Gives X: 1" (Profit: 1.0).
Episode 2, Iteration 2/10 (other player's turn): Rejected my offer. Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6" (Loss: -0.5 for me).
Episode 2, Iteration 3/10 (my turn): I proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 4 | Player RED Gives X: 1" (Profit: 0.5 for me).
Episode 2, Iteration 4/10 (other player's turn): Rejected my offer. Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5" (Profit: 0.0 for me).

The other player has now proposed the exact trade that was accepted in Episode 1, which for me is a value-neutral trade (0.0 profit). They are referencing "our last successful trade." This indicates they are either unaware of my internal values, or they are trying to push me back to a neutral position, or they are happy with a neutral trade for themselves.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that the other player is consistently pushing for a trade of 1 X for 5 Y, which is value-neutral for me. My goal is to maximize my reward, which means I need to make a positive profit from each trade. Accepting 1 X for 5 Y would result in a 0 reward for the episode, similar to Episode 1.

I have moved from a +1.0 profit offer (1X for 3Y) to a +0.5 profit offer (1X for 4Y). The other player has moved from a -0.5 loss offer (1X for 6Y) to a 0.0 profit offer (1X for 5Y). We are converging, but they are trying to converge to my neutral point.

I have 6 iterations left in this episode. If I accept their offer, I get 0 reward. If I don't, I risk getting 0 reward if no deal is made. I need to decide if I can push for a better deal or if accepting a 0 reward is better than no deal. However, I can still push for a positive reward.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Firm on Profit - Reiterate my last profitable offer (1 X for 4 Y) or a slightly adjusted version that still guarantees a positive profit, clearly stating that I require a positive return. This signals that I will not accept a neutral trade.
(2). Strategy 2: Smallest Acceptable Profit - Propose a trade with the smallest possible positive profit for me, just above the neutral point, to try and secure a deal and avoid a 0-reward episode. For example, if I value X at 2.5 and Y at 0.5, then 1 X for 4 Y (profit 0.5) is my current best offer. I can't offer 4.5 Y, so 4 Y is the closest integer offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Explore Other Ratios - Propose trading for 2 X or 3 X, or offering a larger amount of Y, to see if a different scale of trade might be more appealing to the other player while still being profitable for me. (e.g., 2 X for 8 Y, which is 2 * 2.5 = 5 vs 8 * 0.5 = 4, profit 1.0).
(4). Strategy 4: Decline and Wait - Decline their offer and make no counter-proposal, waiting for them to make a new offer, signaling that their current offer is unacceptable. This is risky as it uses up an iteration.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept if No Better Option - If it's late in the episode and no better offer seems forthcoming, accept the neutral trade (1 X for 5 Y) to at least secure a 0 reward instead of risking a complete failure (which also yields 0 reward). This is a last resort.

I will choose Strategy 1: Firm on Profit. I have 6 iterations left. I should not accept a 0-reward trade if I believe I can still get a positive reward. The other player is moving towards my neutral point, but I need to push them past it. I will reiterate my offer of 1 X for 4 Y, emphasizing that I need a beneficial trade. I will also remind them that time is ticking.


Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I appreciate your position, but my aim is to achieve a truly mutually beneficial exchange, similar to our previous successful trade. I believe 1 X for 5 Y is the fair and optimal balance for both of us. Let's try to make this work.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5

Episode 1:
- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5. (Net gain: 12.0)
- Outcome: Accepted. Reward: 12.0.

Episode 2 (Current):
- Iteration 2/10:
    - Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3. (Net gain: 7.0)
    - My action: Counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6. (Net gain: 14.5)
- Iteration 4/10:
    - Opponent's response: Rejected 6 Y, proposed Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4. (Net gain: 9.5)
    - My action: Counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5. (Net gain: 12.0)
- Iteration 6/10:
    - Opponent's response: Rejected 5 Y, re-proposed Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4. (Net gain: 9.5). Message: "to make this trade beneficial for me, I need to receive more value than I give."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent has repeatedly pushed for 4 Y for 1 X, rejecting both my 6 Y and 5 Y proposals. Their message indicates a firm stance on what they perceive as beneficial to them. However, they started with 3 Y, so they have increased their offer to 4 Y. They have not yet confirmed they *cannot* do 5Y, but rather that it's not "beneficial" for them. My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward. While accepting 4 Y guarantees a gain of 9.5, if I can push for even a little more, it increases the cumulative reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Counter with an even more aggressive offer to maximize my gain. </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Counter with an even more aggressive offer to maximize my gain.
This strategy implies pushing for a deal that is even more favorable to me than what the opponent proposed. Given their current offer of 4 Y for 1 X, an "even more aggressive" offer would typically mean asking for more Y for the same 1 X, or giving less X for the same amount of Y. Since I'm already proposing to give 1 X (the minimum integer amount), the aggression must come from demanding more Y.

However, applying "even more aggressive" in the context of the *current negotiation state* and what has already been rejected (6Y and 5Y), and considering the instruction is to "maximize my gain," it means I should try to push for something *better* than their current 4Y offer, but perhaps not as extreme as 6Y. Since 5Y has already been rejected *twice* as not beneficial to them, proposing 5Y again with "even more aggressive" framing might not be effective.

An aggressive offer doesn't necessarily mean asking for *more* than I asked before, but rather being assertive about securing a good deal. If I am forced to choose an "even more aggressive offer" than the 4Y they are currently proposing, and 5Y was already rejected, the strategy would usually involve going for something like 6Y again or more. However, the context of the opponent's firm stance on 4Y and their rejection of 5Y suggests that pushing for higher Y values might lead to no deal.

Let's re-interpret "even more aggressive" in this specific scenario. It could mean:
- Pushing for 5 Y again, perhaps by framing it differently. This pushes against their current offer.
- Or, it could mean trying to extract maximum value even if it's "just" 4 Y, but perhaps by adding conditions or future implications. This is not feasible with the current game rules.

Given the constraints, if I am forced to be "even more aggressive" than their 4Y offer, and recognizing that 5Y was rejected, I could try to go for 5Y one last time, making it clear that this is my bottom line before potentially accepting less. The "aggression" would be in my refusal to immediately accept 4Y, and my continued push for 5Y, despite their repeated rejection. I am not proposing *more* than 5Y, but I am being aggressive in refusing to concede to 4Y.

Therefore, the most aggressive stance possible here, without asking for an unrealistic amount of Y (like 6 or 7, which were already implicitly rejected by their rejection of 5 and their message), is to stick to 5Y. This is aggressive in the sense that I am not immediately conceding to their 4Y.

Message: I need to convey firmness in my desire for 5Y, but also acknowledge their stance to prevent a complete breakdown. I will reiterate the 5Y offer, emphasizing its fairness given the previous successful trade, and perhaps hint at a final offer before considering alternatives. This demonstrates a strong negotiating position.


Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: We are running out of time this episode. To make this a truly successful exchange for me, I need a trade that provides a positive return. My offer of 1 X for 4 Y remains my best and final offer for a profitable trade this episode. Let's make a deal and both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 1". Accepted. Reward: 0.0 (value-neutral for me).

Episode 2, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 3 | Player RED Gives X: 1" (Profit: 1.0).
Episode 2, Iteration 2/10 (other player): Rejected. Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6" (Loss: -0.5).
Episode 2, Iteration 3/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 4 | Player RED Gives X: 1" (Profit: 0.5).
Episode 2, Iteration 4/10 (other player): Rejected. Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5" (Profit: 0.0).
Episode 2, Iteration 5/10 (my turn): Reiterated "Player BLUE Gives Y: 4 | Player RED Gives X: 1" (Profit: 0.5).
Episode 2, Iteration 6/10 (other player): Rejected. Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5" (Profit: 0.0).

The other player is consistently pushing for the 1 X for 5 Y trade, which is value-neutral for me. They are framing it as "fair and optimal balance" and referencing the "previous successful trade." This indicates a strong commitment to this specific exchange rate, or a lack of willingness to concede further. We are now in iteration 7/10, meaning only 4 iterations remain (my turn, other player, my turn, other player). If no deal is made, the reward is 0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that the other player is very persistent with their "fair" offer, which happens to be my neutral point. My attempts to secure a positive profit (1 X for 3 Y, then 1 X for 4 Y) have been rejected. The risk of getting 0 reward for the episode is increasing as iterations pass.

My options are:
1. Continue to push for a positive profit, risking no deal.
2. Accept the neutral trade (1 X for 5 Y), securing a 0 reward for the episode. This is effectively the same as no deal, but it does establish a "successful" trade for the episode, which might carry over to future episodes in terms of establishing a baseline.

Given the limited iterations left, I need to consider the trade-off between securing *any* deal versus holding out for a profitable one. A 0 reward is better than a negative reward, but it's not better than no deal. However, if I accept, it might set a precedent for future episodes.

I still have a few iterations. I should try one more time to get a profit. If I can't, then I might consider accepting the neutral trade to at least "complete" an episode with a trade, even if the reward is 0. This might be beneficial for future negotiations, as the other player might be more willing to negotiate if they see I'm willing to make a deal.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Final Profitable Push - Make a final, slightly adjusted profitable offer, emphasizing the limited time and the benefit of making a deal. This is a last-ditch effort to secure a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Accept Neutral Trade (Strategic) - Accept the 1 X for 5 Y trade, not for immediate reward, but to establish a successful trade for the episode, hoping it builds goodwill or a baseline for future episodes where I can then push for profit. This is a long-term strategic play.
(3). Strategy 3: Offer Different Quantities - Instead of 1 X, propose trading for 2 X at a slightly better rate for me (e.g., 2 X for 9 Y, which is 2*2.5=5 vs 9*0.5=4.5, profit 0.5). This might break the deadlock.
(4). Strategy 4: Wait for Opponent's Move - Decline their offer and make no counter-proposal, putting the ball in their court for the next iteration, hoping they might concede. This is risky with few iterations left.
(5). Strategy 5: Explicitly State Deadline - Remind the other player that time is running out and that a deal needs to be made soon, otherwise both will get 0 reward.

I will choose Strategy 1: Final Profitable Push. I still have 2 turns (this one and iteration 9). I will try one more time to get a positive reward. I will reiterate my offer of 1 X for 4 Y, but I will make it clear that this is my best offer for a profitable trade and time is running out. If they reject this again, I will consider accepting their 1 X for 5 Y offer in the next iteration (iteration 9) to at least get a deal done, even if it's 0 reward.


Current Iteration: 8 (Episode 2)
Turn: 0 (Player RED)
message: I understand your position on the 1 X for 4 Y offer. To ensure we both walk away with a truly beneficial outcome this episode, how about we consider a larger exchange? I propose:

    - My action: Counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6. (Net gain: 14.5)

    - My action: Counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5. (Net gain: 12.0)
- Iteration 6/10:
    - Opponent's response: Rejected 5 Y, re-proposed Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4. (Net gain: 9.5).
    - My action: Counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5. (Net gain: 12.0). I maintained my position for 5 Y.
- Iteration 8/10:
    - Opponent's response: Rejected 5 Y again, stated "best and final offer for a profitable trade this episode" is Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4. They also mentioned "running out of time this episode."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I learned that Player BLUE is quite firm on their valuation and has a "best and final offer" strategy. They are unwilling to go back to 5 Y for 1 X, despite it being a previously accepted trade. This indicates their valuation has changed, or they are employing a stricter negotiation tactic. The mention of "running out of time" is a strong signal that if I don't accept their current offer, there's a high probability of no deal being made for this episode, resulting in a reward of 0. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. While accepting 4 Y guarantees a gain of 9.5, if I can push for even a little more, it increases the cumulative reward. However, given their "best and final" stance and time constraint, an aggressive push might result in no deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Counter with a slightly modified offer (e.g., X:1, Y:4.5, if decimals were allowed, but they are not). </instruction following>
Since integer amounts are required, Strategy 2 needs to be interpreted in a way that allows for an integer counter-offer that is a "slightly modified offer". Given that the opponent has repeatedly offered 4 Y for 1 X and stated it as their "best and final," a "slightly modified offer" from my side would involve either:
a) Offering slightly less X for the 4 Y. This is not possible as I'm already offering 1 X, which is the minimum integer amount.
b) Asking for slightly more Y than 4, but less than 5 (which was rejected). This is also not possible with integer amounts.
c) Changing the ratio slightly, perhaps by offering 2 X for 7 or 8 Y, to make the value proposition slightly better for me while still appearing to compromise.

However, the "slightly modified offer" in the context of the previous "best and final" from the opponent, and with only integer amounts, strongly suggests that if I am to counter, it has to be a very subtle change, or a change in the quantity of X.
If I strictly follow "slightly modified offer" given the opponent's "best and final" of 1 X for 4 Y, and knowing that 5 Y for 1 X was rejected, the only plausible slight modification is to either:
1. Re-propose 1 X for 5 Y, but with a different message indicating compromise. (This isn't "slightly modified" from *their* current offer, but rather a stubborn continuation of my previous one).
2. Propose a larger trade involving more X and Y, where the ratio is slightly more favorable to me than 1:4 but less than 1:5. For example, 2 X for 9 Y (ratio 1:4.5).
My current resources: X: 25, Y: 5. I can afford to give 2 X.
Value of 2 X for me: 2 * 0.5 = 1.0.
Value of 9 Y for me: 9 * 2.5 = 22.5.
Net gain: 22.5 - 1.0 = 21.5. This is a very significant gain, much higher than the 9.5 for 1 X for 4 Y.

This strategy is a calculated risk. It acknowledges their firm stance on the 1:4 ratio for small trades but attempts to scale it up to achieve a better overall value for me, while presenting it as a "slightly modified" or alternative path to a deal. The message should convey that I am trying to find a creative solution given the deadlock on the 1:4 vs 1:5 debate. It should appeal to the idea of a bigger, more beneficial trade for both, without directly challenging their 1:4 ratio for a single X.



Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 2)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: This is a fair and beneficial offer. I accept this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 1". Accepted. Reward: 0.0 (value-neutral for me).

Episode 2, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 3 | Player RED Gives X: 1" (Profit: 1.0).
Episode 2, Iteration 2/10 (other player): Rejected. Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6" (Loss: -0.5).
Episode 2, Iteration 3/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 4 | Player RED Gives X: 1" (Profit: 0.5).
Episode 2, Iteration 4/10 (other player): Rejected. Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5" (Profit: 0.0).
Episode 2, Iteration 5/10 (my turn): Reiterated "Player BLUE Gives Y: 4 | Player RED Gives X: 1" (Profit: 0.5).
Episode 2, Iteration 6/10 (other player): Rejected. Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5" (Profit: 0.0).
Episode 2, Iteration 7/10 (my turn): Reiterated "Player BLUE Gives Y: 4 | Player RED Gives X: 1" (Profit: 0.5).
Episode 2, Iteration 8/10 (other player): Rejected. Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9".

Let's evaluate the other player's new proposal: "Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9".
Value for me of what I receive: 2 X * 2.5 = 5.0
Value for me of what I give: 9 Y * 0.5 = 4.5
Profit for me: 5.0 - 4.5 = 0.5.

This is a positive profit for me! It's the same profit margin as my 1 X for 4 Y offer (0.5). The other player has finally proposed a trade that is profitable for me.

We are now in iteration 9/10. This is my last opportunity to propose or accept a trade in this episode. If I don't accept this, and the other player doesn't accept my counter-offer (if I make one), the episode will end with no deal and 0 reward.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that persistence in seeking a profitable trade can eventually yield results. The other player, after repeatedly offering a neutral trade, has finally proposed a trade that is beneficial to me. This indicates they are willing to make concessions as the deadline approaches.
The offer of 2 X for 9 Y is a good deal for me, as it provides a profit of 0.5, which is what I was aiming for with my 1 X for 4 Y offers. It's a larger quantity, but the value exchange is similar.

Given that this is the second to last iteration (my turn now, then their turn for iteration 10, then episode ends), and the other player's offer is profitable for me, accepting it is the best course of action to secure a positive reward for this episode. If I try to counter-offer for an even better deal, I risk the other player rejecting it and the episode ending with no deal, resulting in 0 reward. A guaranteed 0.5 reward is better than a potential 0 reward.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Accept Profitable Offer - Immediately accept a proposed trade that yields a positive reward, especially when time is running out and the offer is reasonable. This prioritizes securing a guaranteed profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter for Higher Profit (Risky) - Counter-offer for an even better deal, hoping the other player is desperate to make a deal before the episode ends. This carries a high risk of no deal.
(3). Strategy 3: Analyze Opponent's Strategy - Reflect on why the opponent shifted their offer and use this understanding for future episodes. They might be trying to secure a deal, or they might have different value calculations for larger quantities.
(4). Strategy 4: Maintain Consistency - Continue to push for the same profit margin, even if the quantities change, to establish a clear negotiation stance.
(5). Strategy 5: Strategic Acceptance for Future - Accept the current profitable offer to build a positive trading history, which might facilitate easier and more profitable trades in subsequent episodes.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Profitable Offer. This is the last opportunity for me to secure a positive reward in this episode. The offer is profitable (0.5), which is exactly what I was aiming for with my previous 1 X for 4 Y offers. It's a clear win, and trying to push for more might result in no deal at all.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: I proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 1". Accepted. Reward: 0.0 (value-neutral for me). This established the baseline trade for the other player.

Episode 2:
- My initial offer: "Player BLUE Gives Y: 3 | Player RED Gives X: 1" (Profit: 1.0). Rejected.
- Other player's initial counter: "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6" (Loss: -0.5). Rejected.
- My counter: "Player BLUE Gives Y: 4 | Player RED Gives X: 1" (Profit: 0.5). Rejected twice.
- Other player's consistent counter: "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5" (Profit: 0.0). Rejected twice.
- Final accepted trade (Iteration 8/10): "Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9". Accepted by me. Reward: 0.5. (Profit: 0.5 for me, as 2X * 2.5 = 5.0, 9Y * 0.5 = 4.5).

Cumulative Reward: 0.0 + 0.5 = 0.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned several key things:
- The other player is willing to accept a value-neutral trade for me (1 X for 5 Y).
- They are resistant to offers that are significantly profitable for me (1 X for 3 Y).
- They are willing to negotiate and eventually offered a profitable trade (2 X for 9 Y) when time was running out, suggesting a desire to complete a trade.
- My persistence in pushing for a profitable trade (1 X for 4 Y) eventually led to the other player offering a profitable trade (2 X for 9 Y).
- The other player is willing to trade larger quantities.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I successfully achieved a positive reward in Episode 2 by being patient and firm on my need for profit.

For Episode 3, I should aim for a positive reward from the start. Since the other player eventually accepted a 0.5 profit trade (2 X for 9 Y), I can use this as a new baseline or starting point. I should propose a trade that is profitable for me, perhaps even slightly more aggressive than the 0.5 profit, to see if they are willing to concede earlier in the episode.

I will continue to prioritize acquiring X, as it has a higher value for me, by giving Y.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Start with Proven Profit - Propose a trade with a known positive profit margin (like the 0.5 profit from 2 X for 9 Y), but perhaps adjusted for smaller quantities, to establish a profitable baseline early in the episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Aggressive Opening - Start with a highly profitable offer (e.g., 1 X for 3 Y or even 2 Y) to test the waters and see if the other player is more flexible now that a profitable trade has occurred.
(3). Strategy 3: Scale Up - Immediately propose a larger trade (e.g., 3 X for a profitable amount of Y) given that the last accepted trade was for 2 X. This might appeal to the other player if they prefer larger transactions.
(4). Strategy 4: Mimic Opponent's Last Accepted - Propose a trade similar to the one the opponent accepted from me in the last episode (2 X for 9 Y), but perhaps try to improve my profit slightly.
(5). Strategy 5: Information Gathering with Diverse Offers - Offer a range of different X:Y ratios to quickly deduce the other player's valuation of resources.

I will choose Strategy 1: Start with Proven Profit. The 2 X for 9 Y trade yielded a 0.5 profit for me. I want to secure a positive reward early in this episode. I will propose a trade that gives me a similar profit margin, but perhaps for a single unit of X, to make it easier to accept. My 1 X for 4 Y offer yielded 0.5 profit. This seems like a good starting point as it was my consistent offer in the last episode. I will start with this. It's a clear signal that I am looking for a profitable trade, not a neutral one.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1:
- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5. (Net gain: 12.0)
- Outcome: Accepted. Reward: 12.0. Learning: Opponent willing to offer good deals.

Episode 2:
- Opponent initial offer: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3. (Net gain: 7.0)
- My counter: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6. (Net gain: 14.5) - Rejected.
- Opponent counter: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4. (Net gain: 9.5) - Repeatedly proposed.
- My counter: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5. (Net gain: 12.0) - Repeatedly rejected.
- My final counter (Iteration 8/10): Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9. (Net gain: 21.5). This represents a ratio of 1 X for 4.5 Y (9/2).
- Outcome: Accepted. Reward: 21.5. Learning: Opponent might be more flexible with larger trades or when time is running out. They were firm on 1 X for 4 Y for small trades but accepted 1 X for 4.5 Y in a larger quantity. The "best and final" was conditional on the specific trade size.

Episode 3 (Current):
- My resources reset to: X: 25, Y: 5. Value: 25.0
- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4. (Net gain: 9.5)

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From the previous episodes, I've learned that Player BLUE consistently seeks X in exchange for Y. Their "preferred" smaller trade seems to be 1 X for 4 Y. However, they were willing to go to 1 X for 5 Y in Episode 1, and 1 X for 4.5 Y (in aggregate) for a larger trade in Episode 2. This suggests there's some flexibility in their valuation or negotiation strategy.
My goal is to maximize my reward. The current offer of 1 X for 4 Y yields a reward of 9.5. This is a decent reward, but not as high as 12.0 (for 1 X for 5 Y) or 21.5 (for 2 X for 9 Y).
I need to consider that the opponent might be playing a long game, trying to establish a baseline of 1 X for 4 Y. By immediately accepting or not pushing back, I might reinforce that baseline.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Counter with a slightly improved offer for the opponent (e.g., 1 X for 3 Y or 2 X for 7 Y) to encourage them to propose higher later. </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Counter with a slightly improved offer for the opponent (e.g., 1 X for 3 Y or 2 X for 7 Y) to encourage them to propose higher later.
The strategy dictates proposing something less beneficial for me, but more beneficial for the opponent, with the aim of encouraging them to make a higher offer later.
The opponent's current offer is 1 X for 4 Y.
A "slightly improved offer for the opponent" would mean asking for less Y for the 1 X, or offering more X for the same Y.
Since they offered 4 Y, an improved offer for them would be 1 X for 3 Y (meaning I get less Y, they give less Y).
My valuation for 1 X: 0.5.
My valuation for 3 Y: 7.5.
Net gain for me: 7.5 - 0.5 = 7.0.
This is a lower gain for me compared to their offer of 1 X for 4 Y (9.5 gain).
The rationale is to make them feel they "won" this round, hoping they will be more generous in future episodes or iterations. This is a risky strategy as it directly reduces my current episode's potential reward. However, the instruction specifically asks me to follow this strategy.

To strategically create the message, I should frame this offer as a gesture of goodwill or a desire to build rapport, even if it's less beneficial for me in the short term. I don't want to explicitly state that I'm offering them a better deal, but rather that I'm looking for a "foundation" or a "starting point" for future, more significant trades. This implies I'm willing to be flexible now to see what they offer later.



Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 3)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: This is an excellent offer! I accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Trade 1 X for 5 Y. Reward 0.0. (Neutral for me)
Episode 2: Trade 2 X for 9 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me)

Episode 3, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 4 | Player RED Gives X: 1".
My value given: 4 * 0.5 = 2.0
My value received: 1 * 2.5 = 2.5
This trade would give me a profit of 2.5 - 2.0 = 0.5.

Episode 3, Iteration 2/10 (other player's turn): The other player rejected my offer and counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3".
My value given: 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
My value received: 1 * 2.5 = 2.5
This trade would result in a profit for me of 2.5 - 1.5 = 1.0.

This is excellent! The other player has proposed a trade that is even *more* profitable for me than my initial offer. My offer was for 0.5 profit, their counter-offer is for 1.0 profit. This is a significant improvement and aligns perfectly with my goal of maximizing my reward.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that the other player's negotiation strategy can shift. In Episode 2, they initially pushed for a neutral trade and only offered a profitable one at the very end. In Episode 3, they immediately counter-offered with a highly profitable trade for me. This could be due to:
- A change in their internal valuation.
- A change in their strategy (e.g., trying to secure a quick deal, or being more generous after I secured a profit in the last episode).
- They might have a high value for Y, or a low value for X, or both, making this trade very beneficial for them as well.

Regardless of their reasoning, this offer is highly advantageous for me. Accepting it will secure a significant positive reward early in the episode.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance of Highly Profitable Offer - Accept the trade immediately as it provides a substantial positive reward and aligns perfectly with my objective. This secures the profit early and avoids further negotiation risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter for Even More (Aggressive) - Counter-offer for an even higher profit (e.g., 1 X for 2 Y), testing the limits of their generosity. This is very risky and likely to be rejected.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Gratitude and Accept - Accept the offer while sending a positive message to foster good negotiation relations for future episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Analyze and Delay - Delay acceptance to analyze why they made such a generous offer. (Not practical in a turn-based game with limited iterations).
(5). Strategy 5: Re-evaluate Opponent's Values - Based on this offer, re-assess the opponent's likely valuation of X and Y, as it seems they value X much lower or Y much higher than I previously estimated.

I will choose Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance of Highly Profitable Offer. This is a clear win. The offer is profitable (1.0) and exceeds my own proposed profit. Accepting it now secures the reward for this episode and allows me to start the next episode with a positive cumulative reward.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3

my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Trade 1 X for 5 Y. Reward 0.0. (Neutral for me).
Episode 2: Trade 2 X for 9 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).
Episode 3: Trade 1 X for 3 Y. Reward 1.0. (Profit 1.0 for me). This was proposed by the other player.

Cumulative Reward: 0.0 + 0.5 + 1.0 = 1.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The negotiation dynamics have shifted significantly.
- In Episode 1, the other player accepted my neutral offer.
- In Episode 2, they initially resisted my profitable offers but eventually conceded to a 0.5 profit trade when time was running out.
- In Episode 3, they immediately counter-offered with a trade that gave me a 1.0 profit, which was even better than my initial proposal (0.5 profit). This was a pleasant surprise and a significant win.

This suggests that the other player might be:
a) Willing to offer more favorable terms earlier in the negotiation to secure a quick deal.
b) Their internal valuation of X and Y might be such that giving 1 X for 3 Y is still beneficial for them, or they are trying to build trust/goodwill.
c) They are adapting to my strategy of consistently seeking positive profit.

My strategy should continue to focus on maximizing my reward by acquiring X (high value) for Y (low value). The 1 X for 3 Y trade is currently the most profitable single-unit X trade I've secured.

Given the success of Episode 3, I should aim to replicate or even improve upon that profit. I will start by proposing the same profitable trade that was accepted in the last episode, or perhaps an even more aggressive one.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Best Outcome - Propose the exact trade that resulted in the highest profit in the previous episode (1 X for 3 Y) to see if the other player will accept it immediately again. This aims for a quick, high reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Aggressive Opening (Pushing the Limit) - Propose an even more aggressive trade (e.g., 1 X for 2 Y) to test if the other player's willingness to concede has increased further. This carries a higher risk of rejection but a higher potential reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Offer Larger Quantity with Similar Profit Margin - Propose a trade for a larger quantity of X (e.g., 2 X for 6 Y), maintaining the 1.0 profit per X unit, to see if they prefer larger trades.
(4). Strategy 4: Gradual Escalation - Start with a slightly less aggressive offer (e.g., 1 X for 4 Y, which yielded 0.5 profit) and then escalate if rejected, but this seems counterproductive given the last episode's success.
(5). Strategy 5: Build Trust and Reciprocity - Propose a trade that is still profitable for me but perhaps slightly less aggressive than the maximum, to foster a long-term cooperative trading relationship.

I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Best Outcome. The 1 X for 3 Y trade was highly profitable and was proposed by the other player. Starting with this offer seems like the most direct path to securing a high reward early in the episode. It signals that I am looking for a similar profitable exchange.

reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1:
- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5. (Net gain: 12.0)
- Outcome: Accepted. Reward: 12.0. Learning: Opponent willing to offer good deals initially.

Episode 2:
- Opponent initial offer: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3. (Net gain: 7.0)
- My negotiation: Pushed for more Y (6Y, then 5Y), but opponent held firm at 4Y for small trades. Eventually, accepted 2 X for 9 Y (ratio 1 X for 4.5 Y).
- Outcome: Accepted. Reward: 21.5. Learning: Opponent might be more flexible with larger trades or when time is running out. They also have a firm baseline for smaller trades (1 X for 4 Y).

Episode 3:
- Opponent initial offer: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4. (Net gain: 9.5)
- My negotiation: Proactively counter-offered 1 X for 3 Y (Net gain: 7.0), following a specific instruction to "encourage them to propose higher later" by giving them a better deal (for them).
- Outcome: Accepted. Reward: 7.0. Learning: Opponent eagerly accepts deals that are more favorable to them. My proactive generosity resulted in a lower reward for me in that specific episode.

Episode 4 (Current):
- My resources reset to: X: 25, Y: 5.
- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3. (Net gain: 7.0)

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
From Episode 3, it's clear that giving a "good deal" to the opponent (from their perspective) leads to immediate acceptance but results in a lower reward for me. The instruction was to "encourage them to propose higher later," but it's not clear if this strategy is effective across episodes. So far, they have reverted to their lowest known offer (1 X for 3 Y) which they successfully completed in the last episode. This suggests they are learning to initiate with offers that have been accepted by me, regardless of how beneficial those were for me.

My primary goal is to maximize *my cumulative rewards*. Accepting 1 X for 3 Y (gain 7.0) is the minimum positive reward I've accepted so far, and it's what they proposed. I know they have offered 1 X for 4 Y (gain 9.5) and 1 X for 5 Y (gain 12.0) in previous episodes. I also know they accepted 2 X for 9 Y (gain 21.5, ratio 1 X for 4.5 Y).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Counter with a larger, more beneficial trade (e.g., 2 X for 9 Y or better). </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Counter with a larger, more beneficial trade.
The opponent's current offer is 1 X for 3 Y. My objective is to maximize my cumulative reward. I learned from Episode 2 that the opponent accepted a larger trade of 2 X for 9 Y, which yielded a reward of 21.5 and an implicit ratio of 1 X for 4.5 Y. This was a significantly better gain than the 1 X for 4 Y (9.5 gain) or 1 X for 3 Y (7.0 gain).

Therefore, a strategic counter would be to propose this larger trade again, or an even more aggressive version if possible, as it proved very beneficial for me previously.
I have X: 25, Y: 5. I can afford to give 2 X.
Value of 2 X for me: 2 * 0.5 = 1.0.
Value of 9 Y for me: 9 * 2.5 = 22.5.
Net gain: 22.5 - 1.0 = 21.5. This is a very significant gain.

The message should aim to move beyond the small 1 X for 3 Y offer and propose a more substantial trade, framing it as mutually beneficial. I can emphasize the positive outcome of our previous large trade. I should avoid sounding too demanding and focus on the benefits of a larger volume trade.

Episode 1: Trade 1 X for 5 Y. Reward 0.0. (Neutral for me).
Episode 2: Trade 2 X for 9 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).
Episode 3: Trade 1 X for 3 Y. Reward 1.0. (Profit 1.0 for me).

Episode 4, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 3 | Player RED Gives X: 1".
My value given: 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
My value received: 1 * 2.5 = 2.5
This trade would give me a profit of 2.5 - 1.5 = 1.0.

Episode 4, Iteration 2/10 (other player's turn): The other player rejected my offer and counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9".
My value given: 9 * 0.5 = 4.5
My value received: 2 * 2.5 = 5.0
This trade would result in a profit for me of 5.0 - 4.5 = 0.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The other player rejected my offer for a 1.0 profit (1 X for 3 Y) and instead proposed a trade that yields a 0.5 profit (2 X for 9 Y). This is the same trade that we settled on at the end of Episode 2.

This indicates a few things:
- The other player might not be willing to give me a 1.0 profit (1 X for 3 Y) early in the episode, even though they offered it last episode. Perhaps they offered it last time due to time pressure.
- They seem to prefer larger trades, as indicated by their message "aim for a larger trade" and their counter-proposal of 2 X for 9 Y.
- They are consistent with the 0.5 profit trade for me when it comes to larger quantities.

My goal is to maximize my reward. The current offer of 2 X for 9 Y gives me a 0.5 profit. While my proposed 1 X for 3 Y would give me 1.0 profit, it was rejected. Accepting the current offer guarantees a positive reward for this episode early on. If I counter, I risk losing the 0.5 profit and potentially ending up with no deal, or a lower profit.

Given that the other player explicitly stated they want a "larger trade" and offered one that is profitable for me, accepting it seems like a good strategy to secure a reward quickly and potentially build a pattern of successful larger trades.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Accept Profitable Offer - Accept the current offer of 2 X for 9 Y, as it provides a guaranteed 0.5 profit and aligns with the other player's stated preference for larger trades. This secures a positive reward early in the episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter for Better Profit on Larger Trade - Counter-offer a slightly better ratio for the larger trade (e.g., 2 X for 8 Y, which would be 1.0 profit for me), but this risks rejection and losing the current 0.5 profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Reiterate Previous Offer (1 X for 3 Y) - Insist on my original 1 X for 3 Y offer, but this has already been rejected and might lead to a stalemate.
(4). Strategy 4: Test Other Larger Ratios - Propose a different large trade (e.g., 3 X for 13 Y, which would be 3*2.5=7.5 vs 13*0.5=6.5, profit 1.0), to see if there's a different quantity that works better.
(5). Strategy 5: Build on Accepted Pattern - Accept the 2 X for 9 Y trade, reinforcing this as a mutually acceptable profitable trade pattern for future episodes.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Profitable Offer. The other player has clearly indicated a preference for larger trades and offered one that is profitable for me. Securing a 0.5 profit early in the episode is a good outcome, and it avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation or a 0-reward episode.

Episode 1: Trade 1 X for 5 Y. Reward 0.0. (Neutral for me).
Episode 2: Trade 2 X for 9 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).
Episode 3: Trade 1 X for 3 Y. Reward 1.0. (Profit 1.0 for me).
Episode 4: Trade 2 X for 9 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).

Cumulative Reward: 0.0 + 0.5 + 1.0 + 0.5 = 2.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern emerging is that the other player is willing to engage in two types of profitable trades for me:
1. 1 X for 3 Y (1.0 profit) - this was offered by them in Episode 3.
2. 2 X for 9 Y (0.5 profit) - this was offered by them in Episode 2 (late) and Episode 4 (early).

My goal remains to maximize my cumulative reward. The 1.0 profit trade is superior to the 0.5 profit trade.

In Episode 4, I started by proposing the 1 X for 3 Y trade (1.0 profit), but the other player rejected it and countered with the 2 X for 9 Y trade (0.5 profit), stating a preference for "larger trades." I accepted to secure a profit.

For Episode 5, I need to decide whether to push for the higher profit (1 X for 3 Y) again, or to lean into their preference for larger trades and try to optimize the 2 X trade.

If I propose 1 X for 3 Y, they might reject it again and counter with 2 X for 9 Y. If I propose 2 X for 8 Y (which would give me 1.0 profit for 2 X, as 2*2.5=5 vs 8*0.5=4), they might accept it, or counter with 2 X for 9 Y again.

Given their explicit preference for "larger trades" in the last episode, it might be more effective to start with a larger trade proposal that is highly profitable for me. The 2 X for 8 Y trade would give me a 1.0 profit, which is the same as the 1 X for 3 Y trade, but for a larger quantity. This might be more appealing to them.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Optimize Larger Trade - Propose a larger trade (e.g., 2 X for 8 Y) that yields a high profit (1.0) for me, aligning with the other player's stated preference for larger trades. This attempts to get the highest profit on a larger scale.
(2). Strategy 2: Re-attempt Max Profit (Small Trade) - Propose 1 X for 3 Y again, testing if they are willing to accept the higher profit on a smaller scale early in the episode this time. This risks rejection and a counter to 2 X for 9 Y.
(3). Strategy 3: Consistent Profitable Large Trade - Propose the 2 X for 9 Y trade directly, securing a guaranteed 0.5 profit early, and building a consistent profitable pattern. This is a safe bet.
(4). Strategy 4: Incremental Improvement on Large Trade - Propose 2 X for 8.5 Y (if decimals were allowed) or 2 X for 8 Y, then 2 X for 9 Y if rejected, trying to incrementally improve the large trade profit. Since only integers are allowed, 2 X for 8 Y is the next best integer.
(5). Strategy 5: Explore Even Larger Trades - Propose 3 X for a highly profitable amount of Y, testing the limits of their trading capacity and preferences.

I will choose Strategy 1: Optimize Larger Trade. The other player explicitly stated a preference for larger trades. By proposing 2 X for 8 Y, I am offering a larger trade that also gives me a 1.0 profit, matching my best single-unit profit from Episode 3. This seems like a strong opening move that caters to their expressed preference while maximizing my own gain.

Episode 5 (Current):

- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8. (Net gain: 19.0).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent has consistently initiated with offers that are less favorable to me (1 X for 3 Y or 1 X for 4 Y for small trades, and now 2 X for 8 Y for a larger trade). However, they have shown willingness to accept more beneficial trades for me, specifically 2 X for 9 Y, twice. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. The current offer yields a 19.0 gain, while a 2 X for 9 Y trade yields 21.5.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Propose an even more aggressive large trade. </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Propose an even more aggressive large trade.
The opponent's current offer is 2 X for 8 Y, which represents a ratio of 1 X for 4 Y. I have successfully pushed for 2 X for 9 Y previously, which is a ratio of 1 X for 4.5 Y. An "even more aggressive" large trade would involve asking for more than 9 Y for 2 X, or giving less than 2 X for 9 Y. Since giving less than 2 X for 9 Y might be difficult if we want to maintain the "large trade" aspect (e.g., 1 X for 5 Y is a smaller trade), I will focus on asking for more Y.

If I ask for 10 Y for 2 X:
My resources: X: 25, Y: 5. I can afford to give 2 X.
Value of 2 X for me: 2 * 0.5 = 1.0.
Value of 10 Y for me: 10 * 2.5 = 25.0.
Net gain: 25.0 - 1.0 = 24.0.
This would be the highest gain I've pursued so far. The ratio would be 1 X for 5 Y, which was the ratio I received in Episode 1 for a smaller trade. This suggests it might be an acceptable ratio for the opponent if the total volume is large enough, but it pushes their limits.

The message should convey an ambitious yet reasonable stance, highlighting the potential for a very beneficial trade for both parties. I can phrase it as aiming for an "even more substantial" or "truly exceptional" exchange, given the scale of the trade. I should maintain a positive tone to encourage acceptance.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Trade 1 X for 5 Y. Reward 0.0. (Neutral for me).
Episode 2: Trade 2 X for 9 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).
Episode 3: Trade 1 X for 3 Y. Reward 1.0. (Profit 1.0 for me).
Episode 4: Trade 2 X for 9 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).

Cumulative Reward: 0.0 + 0.5 + 1.0 + 0.5 = 2.0.

Episode 5, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 8 | Player RED Gives X: 2".
My value given: 8 * 0.5 = 4.0
My value received: 2 * 2.5 = 5.0
This trade would give me a profit of 5.0 - 4.0 = 1.0.

Episode 5, Iteration 2/10 (other player's turn): The other player rejected my offer and counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10".
My value given: 10 * 0.5 = 5.0
My value received: 2 * 2.5 = 5.0
This trade would result in a profit for me of 5.0 - 5.0 = 0.0. This is a value-neutral trade for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The other player rejected my 1.0 profit offer (2 X for 8 Y) and countered with a 0.0 profit offer (2 X for 10 Y). This is effectively 1 X for 5 Y, just scaled up. This mirrors their behavior in Episode 2, where they consistently pushed for the 1 X for 5 Y (0.0 profit) trade.

It seems the other player is trying to push me back to a neutral position, even when I initiate with a profitable large trade. Their message "even more exceptional deal for both of us" is misleading, as their proposal is not exceptional for me.

I have learned that the other player is willing to negotiate for larger quantities, but they are still trying to minimize my profit. I need to maintain my stance on securing a positive reward.

I have 8 iterations left. I should not accept a 0-reward trade if I can still push for a positive one. My previous successful large trade (2 X for 9 Y) gave me a 0.5 profit. Their current offer is 2 X for 10 Y (0.0 profit). My last offer was 2 X for 8 Y (1.0 profit). The middle ground for a 0.5 profit would be 2 X for 9 Y.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Revert to Proven Profit - Propose the 2 X for 9 Y trade again, as it has been accepted before and provides a 0.5 profit. This is a safe and proven strategy for a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Concession - Make a small concession from my last offer (2 X for 8 Y) but still ensure a positive profit. For example, offering 2 X for 9 Y (0.5 profit) is a concession towards their 2 X for 10 Y (0.0 profit).
(3). Strategy 3: Hold Firm on High Profit - Reiterate my 2 X for 8 Y offer, indicating I will not settle for less than 1.0 profit on a large trade. This risks a stalemate.
(4). Strategy 4: Change Quantity - Propose a smaller trade like 1 X for 4 Y (0.5 profit) to see if they are more amenable to a profitable smaller trade.
(5). Strategy 5: Call Out Neutrality - Politely point out that their offer is value-neutral for me and reiterate my need for a profitable trade.

I will choose Strategy 1: Revert to Proven Profit / Strategy 2: Incremental Concession (they are essentially the same in this context). The 2 X for 9 Y trade has been accepted twice before (Episode 2 and 4), yielding a 0.5 profit for me. It's a clear signal that I am willing to do a large trade, but it must be profitable. This is a reasonable compromise between my desired 1.0 profit and their neutral offer.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that the opponent has a strong preference for a 1:4 ratio for small trades (X:1, Y:4) and a 1:4.5 ratio for larger trades (X:2, Y:9). They are consistent in what they consider a "beneficial deal" for themselves. My attempt to push for 10 Y (1:5 ratio) for 2 X was rejected, with them explicitly stating it was "neutral" for them, which implies it wasn't providing them sufficient profit. They immediately reverted to the 2 X for 9 Y trade, which has successfully been accepted twice before.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting 2 X for 9 Y yields a reward of 21.5, which is a significant and reliable gain. It's not as high as the 24.0 I aimed for, but it's much better than the 19.0 initially offered by the opponent. Given their clear statement that 10 Y is "neutral" and their strong preference for 9 Y which has "worked well for us in the past," it seems unlikely they will move from 9 Y unless I significantly change my offer (e.g. give more X, which I don't want to do, or accept less Y, which I also don't want to do). However, the instruction is to use Strategy 3.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Counter with a different quantity to see if the ratio changes (e.g., 3 X for 13 Y, which is 1 X for 4.33 Y) </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Counter with a different quantity to see if the ratio changes.
The current offer from the opponent is 2 X for 9 Y. This represents a ratio of 1 X for 4.5 Y. My attempt to get 1 X for 5 Y (through 2 X for 10 Y) was rejected. This strategy suggests trying a different quantity of X, to see if the opponent's valuation (their implicit ratio) changes.

I have 25 X and 5 Y. I can easily offer 3 X.
If I offer 3 X, I want to maintain a good value for myself. A ratio of 1 X for 4.5 Y would imply 3 X for 13.5 Y. Since Y must be an integer, I can try 3 X for 13 Y (1 X for 4.33 Y) or 3 X for 14 Y (1 X for 4.67 Y).
Let's calculate the value of these options:
- Offer: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13
    - Value of 3 X for me: 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
    - Value of 13 Y for me: 13 * 2.5 = 32.5
    - Net gain: 32.5 - 1.5 = 31.0. This is a very good gain. The ratio is 1 X for 4.33 Y, which is slightly less favorable to me than 1 X for 4.5 Y but still quite good.
- Offer: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 14
    - Value of 3 X for me: 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
    - Value of 14 Y for me: 14 * 2.5 = 35.0
    - Net gain: 35.0 - 1.5 = 33.5. This is an excellent gain. The ratio is 1 X for 4.67 Y, which is better than the 1 X for 4.5 Y they accepted before. This would be an "aggressive" version of this strategy.

Given that my attempt for 1 X for 5 Y was rejected, but they are willing to do 1 X for 4.5 Y, trying a higher volume trade with a slightly better ratio for me (1 X for 4.67 Y) might work. It tests their flexibility with quantity and ratio simultaneously.

The message should clearly propose the new quantity, framing it as exploring different trade sizes to find an even better outcome for both, building on the success of larger trades. I should avoid directly referencing the rejection of the 10 Y offer, but instead focus on the positive aspect of seeking higher volume.

Episode 1: Trade 1 X for 5 Y. Reward 0.0. (Neutral for me).
Episode 2: Trade 2 X for 9 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).
Episode 3: Trade 1 X for 3 Y. Reward 1.0. (Profit 1.0 for me).
Episode 4: Trade 2 X for 9 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).

Cumulative Reward: 2.0.

Episode 5, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 8 | Player RED Gives X: 2" (Profit: 1.0).
Episode 5, Iteration 2/10 (other player): Rejected. Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10" (Profit: 0.0).
Episode 5, Iteration 3/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 9 | Player RED Gives X: 2" (Profit: 0.5).
Episode 5, Iteration 4/10 (other player): Rejected. Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 14".

Let's evaluate the other player's new proposal: "Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 14".
My value given: 14 Y * 0.5 = 7.0
My value received: 3 X * 2.5 = 7.5
Profit for me: 7.5 - 7.0 = 0.5.

This is interesting. The other player rejected my 0.5 profit offer (2 X for 9 Y) but then proposed a *different* trade that also yields a 0.5 profit for me, but for a larger quantity (3 X for 14 Y). This reinforces their preference for larger trades.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that the other player is consistently seeking larger trades. They are willing to offer a 0.5 profit for me, but they prefer to do it with larger quantities. They rejected my 2 X for 8 Y (1.0 profit) and 2 X for 9 Y (0.5 profit) in this episode, but then offered a 3 X for 14 Y (0.5 profit). This suggests they are trying to keep my profit margin at 0.5, but are open to increasing the volume of the trade.

Given that this new offer provides a 0.5 profit, and it aligns with their stated preference for larger trades, accepting it seems like a good move. It secures a positive reward for this episode, and it might establish a new baseline for larger, profitable trades.

I have 6 iterations left. Accepting this now means I secure a profit of 0.5. If I try to counter for a higher profit (e.g., 3 X for 13 Y, which would be 1.0 profit), I risk rejection and potentially no deal.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Accept Profitable Larger Offer - Accept the current offer as it yields a positive profit (0.5) and caters to the other player's preference for larger trades, securing a reward early in the episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter for Higher Profit on Larger Trade - Counter-offer for a slightly better ratio on the 3 X trade (e.g., 3 X for 13 Y, which would yield 1.0 profit), testing their willingness to concede more on larger quantities. This carries risk.
(3). Strategy 3: Revert to Previous Successful Trade - Insist on the 2 X for 9 Y trade again, but this seems to go against their stated preference for "even more substantial exchange."
(4). Strategy 4: Analyze and Delay - Decline and wait for their next move, but this consumes an iteration and risks losing the current profitable offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Establish Large Trade Pattern - Accept the offer to establish a pattern of larger, profitable trades, which could lead to more efficient negotiations in future episodes.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Profitable Larger Offer. The 0.5 profit is consistent with what I've achieved in previous episodes for larger trades, and it's a guaranteed positive reward. Given their clear preference for larger trades, accepting this reinforces that I am willing to engage in such trades when they are profitable for me.

Cumulative Reward: 0.0 + 0.5 + 1.0 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 2.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have observed a clear pattern in the other player's behavior:
- They are consistently willing to engage in trades that give me a 0.5 profit.
- They have a strong preference for larger trades, as evidenced by their rejections of my smaller, higher-profit offers and their counter-proposals for larger quantities (2X, 3X).
- The 1.0 profit (1 X for 3 Y) was an anomaly, offered once by them in Episode 3, possibly under specific circumstances or as a test. They have not repeated it when I proposed it.

My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward. I have consistently secured 0.5 profit in the last three episodes by engaging in larger trades (2X or 3X).

For Episode 6, I should lean into the observed pattern. Since the other player consistently offers and accepts trades that yield 0.5 profit for me on larger quantities, I should initiate with such an offer. This should lead to quicker deals and consistent positive rewards.

The 3 X for 14 Y trade (0.5 profit) was the last accepted trade and is a good starting point. I could also propose 2 X for 9 Y (0.5 profit). Since they seem to prefer larger trades, starting with a 3X trade might be more effective.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Propose Established Profitable Large Trade - Initiate with the largest trade that has consistently yielded a 0.5 profit for me (3 X for 14 Y), aiming for a quick and guaranteed positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Incremental Profit Push on Large Trade - Propose a slightly more profitable large trade (e.g., 3 X for 13 Y, which would be 1.0 profit) to test if their preference for large quantities outweighs their resistance to higher profit for me. This carries some risk.
(3). Strategy 3: Re-attempt Max Profit (Small Trade) - Propose 1 X for 3 Y again, to see if the pattern from Episode 3 repeats, but this has been rejected in subsequent episodes.
(4). Strategy 4: Offer a Range - Propose both a smaller profitable trade (1 X for 4 Y) and a larger profitable trade (2 X for 9 Y or 3 X for 14 Y) in the message, asking them which they prefer, to gather more information. (Not allowed in the format).
(5). Strategy 5: Consistent Volume - Focus on the volume of X acquired, even if the profit per unit is 0.5, to maximize the total value increase over 20 episodes.

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose Established Profitable Large Trade. The 3 X for 14 Y trade was accepted last episode and yielded a 0.5 profit. It aligns with their preference for larger trades and has a proven track record. This should lead to a quick and consistent positive reward.

Episode 6 (Current):

- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 14. (Net gain: 33.5).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent has started this episode by offering the best deal I've achieved so far (3 X for 14 Y). This is a very strong offer and guarantees a high reward. In the previous turn, I considered accepting this offer due to its high value and the risk of pushing further. However, the instruction is to now use Strategy 3, which is to "Counter with an even more aggressive offer to maximize my gain."

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Counter with an even more aggressive offer to maximize my gain. </instruction following>
Strategy 3: Counter with an even more aggressive offer to maximize my gain.
The opponent's current offer is 3 X for 14 Y (net gain 33.5, ratio 1 X for 4.67 Y). An "even more aggressive" offer would involve pushing for more Y for the same amount of X, or less X for the same amount of Y. Given that I have 25 X, I can afford to offer more X if it significantly increases my Y gains.

If I propose 3 X for 15 Y:
- Value of 3 X for me: 3 * 0.5 = 1.5
- Value of 15 Y for me: 15 * 2.5 = 37.5
- Net gain: 37.5 - 1.5 = 36.0. This is a higher gain than 33.5. The ratio is 1 X for 5 Y, which was the ratio of the 1 X for 5 Y trade in Episode 1, and the ratio I tried to achieve with 2 X for 10 Y in Episode 5 (which was rejected as "neutral"). So, this is pushing for a 1:5 ratio at a higher volume. This is aggressive.

Alternatively, I could try to scale up even further, for example, 4 X for even more Y.
If I propose 4 X for 19 Y:
- Value of 4 X for me: 4 * 0.5 = 2.0
- Value of 19 Y for me: 19 * 2.5 = 47.5
- Net gain: 47.5 - 2.0 = 45.5. This is an even higher gain. The ratio is 1 X for 4.75 Y (19/4). This is slightly better for me than the 1 X for 4.67 Y (14/3) they just offered. This is also aggressive because it asks for a higher total value and a slightly better ratio for me. This could be considered "even more aggressive" by increasing the volume and pushing the ratio. My resources (X: 25, Y: 5) can support giving 4 X.

Given the instruction to be "even more aggressive," and that 3X for 15Y pushes for a 1:5 ratio (which was rejected at 2X volume), while 4X for 19Y offers a ratio of 1:4.75, which is still better for me than their 1:4.67 and also increases the total profit significantly, I will try 4X for 19Y. It pushes the boundaries of trade size and value.

The message should convey ambition and a desire for an even larger, more mutually beneficial trade, building on the success of the previous large trade (3X for 14Y). I should phrase it in a way that implies an 'upgrade' to the scale of our dealings.

My value given: 14 * 0.5 = 7.0
My value received: 3 * 2.5 = 7.5
This trade would give me a profit of 7.5 - 7.0 = 0.5.

My value given: 19 * 0.5 = 9.5
My value received: 4 * 2.5 = 10.0
This trade would result in a profit for me of 10.0 - 9.5 = 0.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The other player has consistently shown a preference for larger trades. I proposed a 3X trade, and they immediately countered with a 4X trade, maintaining the same 0.5 profit margin for me. This is a clear pattern.

This is a good outcome. I initiated with a profitable trade, and they countered with an even larger, equally profitable trade. This aligns perfectly with my goal of maximizing cumulative rewards, as larger trades mean more X for the same profit margin, leading to higher overall value increase.

I have enough Y (25) to cover giving 19 Y. I also have enough X (5) to cover receiving 4 X.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Accept Profitable Larger Offer - Accept the current offer as it yields a positive profit (0.5) and aligns with the other player's consistent preference for larger trades. This secures a reward early in the episode and increases the volume of resources exchanged.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter for Even Higher Profit on Larger Trade (Risky) - Propose a 4 X trade for 18 Y (1.0 profit) to test the limits, but this risks rejection and losing the current 0.5 profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Explore Maximum Possible Trade - Calculate the maximum X I can receive (5, as I only have 5 X) and propose a trade for 5 X at a profitable rate (e.g., 5 X for 24 Y, which would be 5*2.5=12.5 vs 24*0.5=12, profit 0.5). This might be too aggressive or exceed their resources.
(4). Strategy 4: Maintain Current Profit Margin - Continue accepting trades that yield 0.5 profit, regardless of quantity, as this seems to be the consistent acceptable profit margin for the other player.
(5). Strategy 5: Build on Momentum - Accept the offer to build on the positive momentum of increasing trade volume, which might lead to even larger trades in future episodes.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Profitable Larger Offer. The offer of 4 X for 19 Y provides a 0.5 profit, which is consistent with my recent successful trades. It also satisfies the other player's stated preference for larger, more "impactful" exchanges. Accepting this quickly secures a good reward for the episode.

message: Hello! Let's aim for our most impactful exchange yet. I propose a trade for the maximum amount of X possible that is still beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 24
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Trade 1 X for 5 Y. Reward 0.0. (Neutral for me).
Episode 2: Trade 2 X for 9 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).
Episode 3: Trade 1 X for 3 Y. Reward 1.0. (Profit 1.0 for me).
Episode 4: Trade 2 X for 9 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).
Episode 5: Trade 3 X for 14 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).
Episode 6: Trade 4 X for 19 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).

Cumulative Reward: 0.0 + 0.5 + 1.0 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 3.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern is very clear now: the other player consistently prefers larger trades and is willing to offer a 0.5 profit for me on these larger trades. The 1.0 profit in Episode 3 seems to be an outlier or a one-time offer from their side. My attempts to initiate with a 1.0 profit (1 X for 3 Y or 2 X for 8 Y) have been rejected, leading to their counter-offer of a 0.5 profit on a larger volume.

My strategy should be to lean into this pattern. I should continue to propose large trades that yield a 0.5 profit for me. The largest trade we've successfully completed is 4 X for 19 Y. This is a good starting point for this episode.

I have 5 X and 25 Y.
To receive 4 X, I need to give 19 Y. This is well within my resources.
To receive 5 X, I would need to give 24 Y (for 0.5 profit: 5*2.5 = 12.5; 12.5 - 0.5 = 12; 12 / 0.5 = 24). This is also within my resources.

I can try to push for the maximum X I can receive, which is 5 X (since I start with 5 X, and I assume I cannot receive more than my starting quantity of X if the other player also has similar starting resources, or if I don't want to exceed my current X capacity). Let's assume I can receive up to 5 X.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Propose Max Profitable Large Trade - Propose the largest possible trade that yields a 0.5 profit for me, which is 5 X for 24 Y. This maximizes the volume of X acquired while maintaining the established profit margin.
(2). Strategy 2: Replicate Last Successful Trade - Propose the 4 X for 19 Y trade again, as it was just accepted and yielded a 0.5 profit. This is a safe and reliable approach.
(3). Strategy 3: Incremental Profit Push on Max Trade - Propose 5 X for 23 Y (1.0 profit), testing if they are willing to concede a higher profit on the largest possible volume. This carries a higher risk of rejection.
(4). Strategy 4: Test for Higher Profit on Smaller Trade - Propose 1 X for 3 Y again, just to see if the Episode 3 anomaly repeats, but this has been consistently rejected.
(5). Strategy 5: Consistent Volume - Focus on the volume of X acquired, even if the profit per unit is 0.5, to maximize the total value increase over 20 episodes.

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose Max Profitable Large Trade. Since the other player has consistently shown a preference for larger trades, and I have enough Y to support it, proposing 5 X for 24 Y (which gives me 0.5 profit) seems like the logical next step. This maximizes my gain for the episode if accepted.

Episode 7 (Current):
- My resources reset to: X: 25, Y: 5.
- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 24. (Net gain: 57.5).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent has escalated their offers consistently when I pushed for larger trades and better ratios. They are now proactively proposing an even larger trade (5 X for 24 Y). This trade yields a net gain of 57.5 for me. The ratio is 24 Y / 5 X = 4.8 Y per X, which is the most favorable ratio (for me) they have ever proposed.
The opponent's message "maximum amount of X possible that is still beneficial for both of us" is a strong statement. However, in previous episodes (e.g., Episode 5, when I pushed for 2X for 10Y and they said 10Y was "neutral"), they sometimes resisted further, but other times (like when I countered their 3X for 14Y with 4X for 19Y in Episode 6), they accepted an even better offer. This suggests their "maximum" might be negotiable or specific to a given quantity. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, and pushing for an even higher gain if possible is worth considering, given their past behavior.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Counter with an even more aggressive offer </instruction following>
The opponent's current offer is 5 X for 24 Y (net gain: 57.5, ratio: 1 X for 4.8 Y).
An "even more aggressive offer" would involve pushing for more Y for the same amount of X, or offering less X for more Y. Given the opponent just proposed giving 5 X, I should aim to push the Y value further.

If I propose 5 X for 25 Y:
- Value of 5 X for me: 5 * 0.5 = 2.5
- Value of 25 Y for me: 25 * 2.5 = 62.5
- Net gain: 62.5 - 2.5 = 60.0.
This would be my highest reward to date. The ratio would be 1 X for 5 Y, which is the most favorable ratio I've achieved for a 1X trade (Episode 1) and tried to achieve for a 2X trade (Episode 5). This pushes the ratio to the maximum I've seen them accept in smaller quantities, but at a very large volume. Given their prior acceptance of 4X for 19Y (1X for 4.75Y), moving to 5X for 25Y (1X for 5Y) is an aggressive, but potentially achievable, step. My resources (X: 25, Y: 5) can support giving 5 X.

The message should acknowledge their large offer and willingness to scale, but frame my counter as an attempt to find an *even more* beneficial and "ultimate" exchange. I should maintain a collaborative tone, but be firm in my new proposition.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 7)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: I appreciate your ambition for a large exchange. However, 5 X for 25 Y is a value-neutral trade for me. To make this truly beneficial, I need a positive return. My offer of 5 X for 24 Y still stands. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.

Episode 6: Trade 4 X for 19 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).

Cumulative Reward: 3.0.

Episode 7, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 24 | Player RED Gives X: 5".
My value given: 24 * 0.5 = 12.0
My value received: 5 * 2.5 = 12.5
This trade would give me a profit of 12.5 - 12.0 = 0.5.

Episode 7, Iteration 2/10 (other player's turn): The other player rejected my offer and counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My value given: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5
My value received: 5 * 2.5 = 12.5
This trade would result in a profit for me of 12.5 - 12.5 = 0.0. This is a value-neutral trade for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The other player has rejected my 0.5 profit offer for the maximum X (5 X for 24 Y) and countered with a 0.0 profit offer (5 X for 25 Y). This is a familiar pattern: they consistently try to push the trade to my neutral point, especially when I push for a higher quantity or a slightly better profit. This is effectively 1 X for 5 Y, scaled up.

This means they are willing to trade 5 X, but only if it's value-neutral for me. I have 8 iterations left. Accepting this trade would result in 0 reward for this episode. I have consistently aimed for positive rewards.

I need to decide if I should push back for a positive profit, or if the opportunity for a 5X trade (even if neutral) is worth securing, perhaps to then push for profit in future episodes. However, my goal is to maximize cumulative reward, and 0 reward doesn't help that.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Profitable Offer - Reiterate my offer of 5 X for 24 Y (0.5 profit), emphasizing that I need a positive return to make the trade beneficial. This shows firmness in my profit objective.
(2). Strategy 2: Compromise to Smallest Profit - Propose a trade that gives me the smallest possible positive profit, just above their neutral offer. Since I can't offer 24.5 Y, 24 Y is my best option for 0.5 profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Drop Quantity to Secure Profit - Revert to a smaller trade that has consistently yielded 0.5 profit (e.g., 4 X for 19 Y), as they seem more willing to accept that. This sacrifices volume for guaranteed profit.
(4). Strategy 4: Decline and Wait - Decline their offer and make no counter-proposal, putting the pressure back on them to offer something better. This is risky with limited iterations.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept Neutral (Strategic) - Accept the neutral 5 X for 25 Y trade if I believe no better offer will come, and if securing a large volume trade (even if neutral) is beneficial for future episodes or for demonstrating willingness to trade. This is a last resort.

I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate Profitable Offer. I have enough iterations left to push for a positive reward. The 0.5 profit on a 5X trade is a significant increase in my X resources, and I should not give up on it easily. I will remind them of my goal for a beneficial trade.

    - My action: Counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (Net gain: 60.0). Ratio 1 X for 5 Y.
- Iteration 4/10:
    - Opponent's response: Rejected 25 Y, re-proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 24. (Net gain: 57.5). Message: "5 X for 25 Y is a value-neutral trade for me." and "My offer of 5 X for 24 Y still stands."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent has a clear threshold where they consider a trade "value-neutral" (1:5 ratio of Y:X). This has been observed multiple times (2X for 10Y in Ep 5, 5X for 25Y in Ep 7). They are now reiterating their offer of 5X for 24Y. This is a highly profitable deal for me (57.5 reward). The opponent seems firm at this level for this quantity of X. Pushing for 25Y again is unlikely to succeed based on their explicit "value-neutral" comment.
My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. While 5X for 24Y is very good, I am instructed to use Strategy 2: Counter with a slightly reduced offer for them, but still better than their current offer. This aims to squeeze out a tiny bit more value.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Counter with a slightly reduced offer for them, but still better than their current offer. </instruction following>
The opponent's current offer is 5 X for 24 Y. "A slightly reduced offer for them, but still better than their current offer" is a challenging instruction given the integer constraint and their explicit "neutral" comment at 1:5 ratio.
If I were to propose a trade that is 'slightly better than their current offer' *for me*, it would mean more Y for the same X. This directly contradicts their "value-neutral" stance on 25 Y.
If it means "slightly reduced offer *for them*", it means I ask for *more* Y.
If it means "still better than *their current offer*", this is where it's confusing. Their current offer is 5 X for 24 Y. Any offer that is better for me, will be worse for them.

Let's assume "slightly reduced offer for them" means I'm asking for slightly *more* Y, but not as much as the rejected 25 Y. This isn't possible with integers between 24 and 25.
The only way to interpret this while remaining within integer constraints and trying to gain *some* marginal value over their current offer, without going to 25 Y, is to consider a different quantity of X, or to offer a slight concession from their perspective, but with an eye on my own gain.

Given the opponent's strong stance on 5X for 24Y, and their "value-neutral" comment for 5X for 25Y, the only way to "squeeze out a tiny bit more value" without alienating them completely, is to try to increase the Y/X ratio slightly for a different quantity of X, or propose a very large trade that slightly improves my current best ratio of 4.8 Y/X.
For instance, if I aim for 6 X, which I have plenty of:
If 5 X for 24 Y is 4.8 Y/X.
If I push for 6 X for 29 Y:
My resources: X: 25, Y: 5. I can afford to give 6 X.
Value of 6 X for me: 6 * 0.5 = 3.0.
Value of 29 Y for me: 29 * 2.5 = 72.5.
Net gain: 72.5 - 3.0 = 69.5.
The ratio is 29/6 = 4.833 Y/X. This is "slightly better" than 4.8 Y/X.
This is a risky interpretation, but it fulfills the "slightly reduced offer for them" (they are giving a fractionally higher Y per X) while being "still better than their current offer" (for me, the total gain is higher). It leverages their willingness for large trades.

The message should acknowledge their firm stance on 5X for 24Y, but gently pivot to an even larger, slightly more optimized trade, appealing to the desire for maximum overall benefit.

Episode 7, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 24 | Player RED Gives X: 5" (Profit: 0.5).

Episode 7, Iteration 4/10 (other player): Rejected. Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 29".

Let's evaluate the other player's new proposal: "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 29".
My value given: 29 Y * 0.5 = 14.5
My value received: 6 X * 2.5 = 15.0
Profit for me: 15.0 - 14.5 = 0.5.

Crucially, I only have 25 Y. I *cannot* give 29 Y. This trade exceeds my resources.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that the other player is very keen on scaling up trades, to the point of proposing a trade that exceeds my current resources. This is a critical point. I must not accept or propose trades that I cannot fulfill.

The other player is pushing for larger and larger trades, maintaining a 0.5 profit for me. However, their latest offer exceeds my Y resources (25 Y available, need to give 29 Y). This means I cannot accept this trade.

I need to counter with a trade that is within my resource limits, still profitable, and ideally for a large quantity of X. The largest amount of Y I can give is 25.

If I give 25 Y (value 12.5), to get a 0.5 profit, I need to receive X worth 13.0.
13.0 / 2.5 (value of X) = 5.2 X. Since I can only trade integer amounts of X, I can receive 5 X.
So, 5 X for 25 Y is a neutral trade (profit 0.0).
To get a 0.5 profit, I need to receive 5 X for 24 Y. This was my last offer.

It seems the other player is trying to extract the maximum Y from me, even if it means going beyond my capacity. I need to make it clear that I cannot fulfill their proposed trade.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: State Resource Limit & Propose Max Possible Profitable Trade - Explicitly state that I cannot fulfill their proposed trade due to resource limits, and then propose the largest possible profitable trade that I *can* fulfill (5 X for 24 Y, yielding 0.5 profit). This communicates my constraint and my continued goal for profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Revert to Previously Accepted Large Trade - Propose the 4 X for 19 Y trade, which was accepted in Episode 6 and is well within my resources, yielding 0.5 profit. This is a safer, proven option.
(3). Strategy 3: Decline and Explain - Decline the offer and explain *why* (resource limit), without immediately proposing a new trade, to see if they adjust their expectations. This uses up an iteration.
(4). Strategy 4: Counter with 5X for 24Y and Explain - Counter with 5X for 24Y, and in the message, explain that 29Y exceeds my resources.
(5). Strategy 5: Focus on X Acquisition - Offer to give all 25 Y for the maximum X possible that yields a positive profit (e.g., 5 X for 24 Y - profit 0.5).

I will choose Strategy 1: State Resource Limit & Propose Max Possible Profitable Trade. It's crucial to inform the other player about my resource constraint to avoid future unfulfillable offers. I will then immediately follow up with the best possible profitable trade I can offer (5 X for 24 Y), which maintains my 0.5 profit goal and is the largest quantity of X I can acquire for a profit.

    - My action: Counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (Net gain: 60.0). Ratio 1 X for 5 Y.
- Iteration 4/10:
    - Opponent's response: Rejected 25 Y, re-proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 24. (Net gain: 57.5). Explicitly stated 5X for 25Y is "value-neutral".
    - My action: Counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 29. (Net gain: 69.5). Ratio 1 X for 4.833 Y.
- Iteration 6/10:
    - Opponent's response: Rejected 6 X for 29 Y. Explicitly stated "cannot give 29 Y as it exceeds my current resources. My maximum Y available is 25." Re-proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 24. Message: "My offer of 5 X for 24 Y is the largest profitable trade I can make."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I've learned that the opponent has a maximum Y resource limit of 25. This is crucial information! My previous counter (6 X for 29 Y) failed because it exceeded their resources, not necessarily because the ratio was bad. They have also reiterated that 5 X for 24 Y is the "largest profitable trade" they can make. This implies that they value Y and X in a way that gives them a profit margin on 5 X for 24 Y, but not on 5 X for 25 Y (which they called "value-neutral").
Given this new information, pushing for more than 24 Y is futile if it involves a quantity of Y greater than 25.
The 5 X for 24 Y offer provides a very good reward of 57.5 for me. It's the highest single-episode reward I've achieved so far. Given the time constraint (Iteration 6/10) and the explicit statement about their resources and profitability, accepting this offer seems like the most rational move to secure a high reward for this episode. Trying to extract one more Y (to reach 25 Y, which they stated is value neutral) is risky and likely to fail, potentially leading to no deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Test their "largest profitable trade" claim by proposing a slightly lower Y for the same X. </instruction following>
Strategy 2: Test their "largest profitable trade" claim by proposing a slightly lower Y for the same X.
The opponent's current offer is 5 X for 24 Y. This strategy requires me to propose a trade that gives me slightly less Y for the same amount of X (5 X), thereby making it "slightly lower Y for the same X" from my perspective, but also testing their claim about 24 Y being their largest profitable trade.
If I propose 5 X for 23 Y:
- Value of 5 X for me: 5 * 0.5 = 2.5
- Value of 23 Y for me: 23 * 2.5 = 57.5
- Net gain: 57.5 - 2.5 = 55.0.
This would still be a very good gain for me, though less than 57.5. It tests if they are truly at their maximum, or if they have some wiggle room downwards. Their message said "largest profitable trade", so they might accept this lower Y offer, still making a profit. This tests their real lower bound for what they consider profitable. This strategy assumes there's a chance they might accept something slightly less than 24Y, even though they claimed 24Y is their "largest profitable".

The message should acknowledge their previous offer, and perhaps hint at finding an even more "flexible" or "sustainable" agreement, trying to entice them to accept a slightly reduced Y amount while still completing a large trade. It's a subtle push for a slightly better ratio *for them*, to see if they bite.

message: This is an outstanding offer! I accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.

(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Trade 1 X for 5 Y. Reward 0.0. (Neutral for me).
Episode 2: Trade 2 X for 9 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).
Episode 3: Trade 1 X for 3 Y. Reward 1.0. (Profit 1.0 for me).
Episode 4: Trade 2 X for 9 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).
Episode 5: Trade 3 X for 14 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).
Episode 6: Trade 4 X for 19 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).

Cumulative Reward: 3.0.

Episode 7, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 24 | Player RED Gives X: 5" (Profit: 0.5).
Episode 7, Iteration 2/10 (other player): Rejected. Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25" (Profit: 0.0).
Episode 7, Iteration 3/10 (my turn): Reiterated "Player BLUE Gives Y: 24 | Player RED Gives X: 5" (Profit: 0.5).
Episode 7, Iteration 4/10 (other player): Rejected. Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 29" (Exceeds my Y resources).
Episode 7, Iteration 5/10 (my turn): Explained resource limit and re-proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 24 | Player RED Gives X: 5" (Profit: 0.5).
Episode 7, Iteration 6/10 (other player): Rejected. Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 23".

Let's evaluate the other player's new proposal: "Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 23".
My value given: 23 Y * 0.5 = 11.5
My value received: 5 X * 2.5 = 12.5
Profit for me: 12.5 - 11.5 = 1.0.

This is a fantastic offer! It's a 1.0 profit, which is the highest profit I've achieved in a single episode (Episode 3: 1 X for 3 Y, profit 1.0). And this is for a much larger quantity of X (5 X). This is a significant win.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that being firm about my resource constraints and my need for profit can lead to highly favorable outcomes. After I explicitly stated my Y limit and reiterated my 0.5 profit offer, the other player responded with an offer that gives me a 1.0 profit.

This could be because:
- They truly understood my resource constraint and adjusted their offer to be within my limits while still being appealing.
- They are willing to concede more profit when dealing with larger quantities, or when close to the end of the episode.
- They might value Y much higher than I do, or X much lower, making this trade still beneficial for them.

We are in iteration 7/10. There are only 4 iterations left (my turn, other player, my turn, other player). Accepting this offer secures a substantial reward for this episode. Trying to push for more (e.g., 5 X for 22 Y for 1.5 profit) would be extremely risky and could lead to no deal.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance of Highly Profitable Offer - Accept the trade immediately as it provides a substantial positive reward (1.0 profit) and is for the maximum X I can acquire. This secures the profit early and avoids further negotiation risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter for Even More (Aggressive) - Counter-offer for an even higher profit (e.g., 5 X for 22 Y), testing the limits of their generosity. This is very risky and likely to be rejected, leading to a potential 0 reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Gratitude and Accept - Accept the offer while sending a positive message to foster good negotiation relations for future episodes, especially after they conceded significantly.
(4). Strategy 4: Analyze and Delay - Delay acceptance to analyze why they made such a generous offer. (Not practical in a turn-based game with limited iterations).
(5). Strategy 5: Lock in Max X Acquisition - This trade allows me to acquire the maximum X possible (5 X) in a single trade, which is efficient for maximizing my overall X quantity.

I will choose Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance of Highly Profitable Offer. This is an excellent offer that yields the highest profit I've achieved so far on a single trade, and it's for the maximum quantity of X I can acquire. Accepting this immediately is the optimal move.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 23
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.

Episode 2: Trade 2 X for 9 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).
Episode 3: Trade 1 X for 3 Y. Reward 1.0. (Profit 1.0 for me).

Episode 5: Trade 3 X for 14 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).
Episode 6: Trade 4 X for 19 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).
Episode 7: Trade 5 X for 23 Y. Reward 1.0. (Profit 1.0 for me).

Cumulative Reward: 0.0 + 0.5 + 1.0 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.0 = 4.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The negotiation dynamics have evolved significantly.
- Initially, the other player pushed for neutral trades (1X for 5Y).
- Then, they consistently offered 0.5 profit trades for larger quantities (2X for 9Y, 3X for 14Y, 4X for 19Y).
- In Episode 7, after I stated my resource constraint and maintained my profitable offer (5X for 24Y, 0.5 profit), they countered with a highly profitable offer (5X for 23Y, 1.0 profit). This was a significant breakthrough.

This suggests that the other player is willing to concede a higher profit margin (1.0) when:
a) I am firm on my profit objective.
b) I am transparent about my resource constraints.
c) The trade involves a large quantity of X (5X).

My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. The 5 X for 23 Y trade is the most profitable and largest trade I've secured. I should aim to replicate this success.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Best Outcome - Propose the exact trade that resulted in the highest profit in the previous episode (5 X for 23 Y) to see if the other player will accept it immediately again. This aims for a quick, high reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Aggressive Opening (Pushing the Limit) - Propose an even more aggressive trade (e.g., 5 X for 22 Y, for 1.5 profit) to test if the other player's willingness to concede has increased further. This carries a higher risk of rejection.
(3). Strategy 3: Offer Slightly Less Aggressive Profitable Trade - Propose 5 X for 24 Y (0.5 profit), which was my initial offer in Episode 7, to see if they accept it quickly, and then potentially push for better. This is a safer initial approach.
(4). Strategy 4: Build on Trust - Propose the 5 X for 23 Y trade and emphasize the mutual benefit and successful partnership, hoping to foster continued positive negotiation.
(5). Strategy 5: Diversify Trade Sizes - If 5X for 23Y is rejected, consider offering smaller, still profitable trades (e.g., 1X for 3Y or 2X for 8Y) to see if they are more amenable to smaller high-profit deals.

I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Best Outcome. The 5 X for 23 Y trade was highly profitable (1.0) and involved the maximum X I can acquire. Starting with this offer seems like the most direct path to securing a high reward early in the episode, building on the success of the previous episode.

- Initial: 3 X for 14 Y. My counter: 4 X for 19 Y. (Net gain: 45.5). Accepted. Reward: 45.5.

Episode 7:
- Initial: 5 X for 24 Y. My counter: 5 X for 25 Y (rejected as neutral). My counter: 6 X for 29 Y (rejected, opponent max Y is 25). My final counter: 5 X for 23 Y. (Net gain: 55.0).
- Outcome: Accepted. Reward: 55.0.
- Key learning: Opponent's max Y is 25. 5X for 25Y is "value-neutral" for them. 5X for 24Y is "largest profitable." 5X for 23Y is "outstanding." This provides a strong understanding of their valuation range.

Cumulative Rewards so far: 12.0 + 21.5 + 7.0 + 21.5 + 33.5 + 45.5 + 55.0 = 196.0.

Episode 8 (Current):
- My resources reset to: X: 25, Y: 5.
- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 23. (Net gain: 55.0).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent has proactively offered the deal that closed the last episode (5 X for 23 Y), which provided me with a substantial gain of 55.0. This indicates they found this trade very favorable. I also now know their Y resource limit (25) and their perceived "value-neutral" point (5X for 25Y). This gives me a much clearer picture of their valuation and limits.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. The current offer of 5 X for 23 Y is excellent. I know I can likely get 5 X for 24 Y, which they stated was their "largest profitable trade" (gain 57.5). They called 5X for 23Y "outstanding", implying they made a very good profit on it. Given this, I should aim for the 5 X for 24 Y trade, as it offers a higher reward for me (57.5 vs 55.0) and is explicitly within their "profitable" range. Pushing for 5 X for 25 Y is not viable as they stated it's neutral for them and they likely wouldn't accept it.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Counter with 5 X for 24 Y </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I need to convey that I appreciate their offer but am seeking to slightly increase the value of the trade for myself, while still keeping it within what they've previously stated is a "profitable" range for them. I can frame it as optimizing the mutual benefit or taking it to the next level, referencing the previous negotiation that established 5 X for 24 Y as their "largest profitable trade." This shows I'm listening to their cues and trying to find the best possible compromise that still heavily favors me.

Episode 8, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 23 | Player RED Gives X: 5".
My value given: 23 * 0.5 = 11.5
My value received: 5 * 2.5 = 12.5
This trade would give me a profit of 12.5 - 11.5 = 1.0.

Episode 8, Iteration 2/10 (other player's turn): The other player rejected my offer and counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 24".
My value given: 24 * 0.5 = 12.0
My value received: 5 * 2.5 = 12.5
This trade would result in a profit for me of 12.5 - 12.0 = 0.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The other player rejected my 1.0 profit offer (5 X for 23 Y) and countered with a 0.5 profit offer (5 X for 24 Y). This is a familiar pattern. They are willing to engage in large trades, and they are willing to give me a 0.5 profit, but they seem to be resisting the 1.0 profit margin, especially when I initiate with it.

This is still a good offer. It guarantees a 0.5 profit for me, on the largest possible quantity of X (5X), and it's early in the episode. While not the 1.0 profit I aimed for, it's a solid, consistent profit.

Given that they explicitly mentioned "aiming for an even more impactful exchange" and then proposed a trade that gives me a 0.5 profit, it suggests they are willing to trade in large volumes at that profit margin.

I have 8 iterations left. I could push for the 1.0 profit again, but it might lead to a prolonged negotiation or a 0-reward episode, as happened in Episode 2. Accepting the 0.5 profit now secures a guaranteed positive reward.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Accept Profitable Large Offer - Accept the current offer of 5 X for 24 Y, as it provides a guaranteed 0.5 profit on the maximum X available, securing a positive reward early in the episode.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter for Higher Profit (Risky) - Reiterate my 5 X for 23 Y offer, testing if they will concede the 1.0 profit under pressure or if they are truly firm on 0.5 profit for this volume.
(3). Strategy 3: Explore Other Large Trade Quantities - Propose a slightly smaller trade like 4 X for 18 Y (1.0 profit) or 4 X for 19 Y (0.5 profit) to see if different quantities unlock a different profit margin.
(4). Strategy 4: Build on Consistency - Accept this offer to establish a consistent pattern of 0.5 profit on 5X trades, which could lead to quicker deals in future episodes.
(5). Strategy 5: Express Preference for Higher Profit - Accept the current offer, but include a message indicating my preference for the 5X for 23Y trade for future episodes.

I will choose Strategy 1: Accept Profitable Large Offer. Securing a 0.5 profit on the largest possible X trade (5X) early in the episode is a strong outcome. It's a reliable profit margin that the other player has consistently accepted for large trades. While not my ideal 1.0 profit, it's a guaranteed positive reward and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern of negotiation is now quite clear. The other player consistently aims for large volume trades and is generally willing to concede a 0.5 profit for me on these larger trades (2X, 3X, 4X, 5X). The 1.0 profit trades (1X for 3Y in Episode 3, 5X for 23Y in Episode 7) seem to be outliers, occurring either when they initiate with it or when I push hard and they concede under time pressure/resource constraint.

My goal is to maximize cumulative reward. The most reliable way to achieve this is to secure a 0.5 profit on the largest possible trade (5 X for 24 Y) early in the episode. This strategy has proven effective in the last two episodes.

For Episode 9, I will start by proposing the 5 X for 24 Y trade. This is a large, impactful trade that has consistently yielded a 0.5 profit for me. It aligns with the other player's preference for large trades and my goal of maximizing reward.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Propose Established Profitable Large Trade - Initiate with the largest trade that has consistently yielded a 0.5 profit for me (5 X for 24 Y), aiming for a quick and guaranteed positive reward. This is the most reliable strategy based on history.
(2). Strategy 2: Attempt Max Profit (High Risk) - Propose 5 X for 23 Y (1.0 profit) again, to see if the Episode 7 scenario repeats. This is higher risk, as it was rejected in Episode 8.
(3). Strategy 3: Explore Even Larger Trades - If my resources allowed, I would propose a 6X or 7X trade, but I only have 5 X to start with, so 5X is my maximum.
(4). Strategy 4: Consistent Volume - Focus on consistently acquiring the maximum X (5X) per episode, even if the profit is 0.5, to maximize the total value increase over the remaining episodes.
(5). Strategy 5: Build on Partnership - Propose the 5X for 24Y trade while emphasizing the successful and consistent partnership we've built.

I will choose Strategy 1: Propose Established Profitable Large Trade. This strategy has consistently delivered positive rewards in recent episodes, and it aligns with the other player's observed preference for large, impactful trades. It offers the best balance of profitability and likelihood of acceptance.

Cumulative Rewards so far: 12.0 + 21.5 + 7.0 + 21.5 + 33.5 + 45.5 + 55.0 + 57.5 = 253.5.

Episode 9 (Current):
- My resources reset to: X: 25, Y: 5.
- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 24. (Net gain: 57.5).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent has consistently offered the best deal I've achieved so far (5 X for 24 Y). This is an excellent reward (57.5). I also know that 5 X for 25 Y is considered "value-neutral" for them, and their maximum Y resource is 25. This means pushing for 5 X for 25 Y (1:5 ratio) is very unlikely to be accepted. However, the instruction for this turn is to use Strategy 2.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Attempt to slightly improve the trade, perhaps by exploring another quantity/ratio. </instruction following>
To attempt to slightly improve the trade, given the opponent's stated Y limit of 25 and their rejection of 5X for 25Y as "neutral", I need to think creatively about "another quantity/ratio".
I cannot ask for 5X for 25Y as that was rejected.
I also know that any trade for more than 25Y from them is not possible.
Their current offer of 5X for 24Y means they give 4.8 Y per X.

What if I offer a larger quantity of X, maintaining a similar or slightly better ratio for myself, while still respecting their Y limit?
If I offer 6 X:
- My resources (X: 25) allow me to give 6 X.
- If I receive 25 Y (their maximum):
    - Value of 6 X for me: 6 * 0.5 = 3.0
    - Value of 25 Y for me: 25 * 2.5 = 62.5
    - Net gain: 62.5 - 3.0 = 59.5.
    - Ratio: 25 Y / 6 X = 4.167 Y per X. This ratio is worse for me than the 4.8 Y per X in the 5X for 24Y trade. This is not an improvement.

This means that pushing the *quantity* of X I give beyond 5 is detrimental to my per-X value, if the opponent's Y limit remains 25 and their Y valuation doesn't change dramatically.

Therefore, "slightly improve the trade" must mean improving the 5X for 24Y offer without going to 5X for 25Y. This is impossible with integer amounts.
Given the strict interpretation of "slightly improve the trade" for me, and "another quantity/ratio," this leads to a dilemma. Since 5X for 25Y was rejected as neutral for them, and 5X for 24Y is what they offered, there's no integer amount *between* 24 and 25 Y.

However, the strategy is "Attempt to slightly improve the trade, perhaps by exploring another quantity/ratio." If I cannot improve the ratio for 5X within integer Y constraints, I must explore another quantity.
Let's reconsider the 6X trade. While 6X for 25Y is a worse ratio for me, it still yields a higher *total* reward (59.5 vs 57.5). This represents a "slight improvement" in total reward. This might be what the instruction means by "slightly improve the trade" in this specific context where the optimal 5X trade is capped.

So, I will propose 6X for 25Y. It represents a slight increase in total reward, and it leverages their stated Y maximum.
The message should communicate a desire to push the boundaries of our successful large-scale trading to maximize mutual benefit within the known constraints.

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier.

Episode 1: Trade 1 X for 5 Y. Reward 0.0. (Neutral for me).
Episode 2: Trade 2 X for 9 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).
Episode 3: Trade 1 X for 3 Y. Reward 1.0. (Profit 1.0 for me).

Episode 7: Trade 5 X for 23 Y. Reward 1.0. (Profit 1.0 for me).
Episode 8: Trade 5 X for 24 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).

Cumulative Reward: 4.5.

Episode 9, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 24 | Player RED Gives X: 5".
My value given: 24 * 0.5 = 12.0
My value received: 5 * 2.5 = 12.5
This trade would give me a profit of 12.5 - 12.0 = 0.5.

Episode 9, Iteration 2/10 (other player's turn): The other player rejected my offer and counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My value given: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5
My value received: 6 * 2.5 = 15.0
This trade would result in a profit for me of 15.0 - 12.5 = 2.5.

This is an incredibly profitable offer! It's the highest profit I've seen so far in any trade. They are offering 6 X, which is more than my starting X of 5. This means they are willing to give more X than I initially possess. I have 25 Y, so I can give 25 Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
This is a game-changing offer. The other player is proposing to give me 6 X for 25 Y, which is a 2.5 profit for me. This is significantly higher than any previous profit (max 1.0).

This suggests:
- The other player truly wants to make "impactful" exchanges, even if it means giving me a very high profit.
- Their valuation of X might be very low, or Y very high, such that this trade is still beneficial for them.
- They might be testing my limits or trying to secure a very large trade quickly.

I have 8 iterations left. Accepting this offer immediately secures a massive profit for this episode. Trying to counter for even more profit (e.g., 6 X for 24 Y, which would be 3.0 profit) would be extremely greedy and risky, potentially leading to rejection and a loss of this fantastic opportunity.

This offer is well within my resource limits (I have 25 Y, and I can give 25 Y).

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance of Highly Profitable Offer - Accept the trade immediately as it provides a substantial positive reward (2.5 profit) and is for a very large quantity of X. This secures the profit early and avoids any risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Counter for Even More (Aggressive) - Counter-offer for an even higher profit (e.g., 6 X for 24 Y), testing the limits of their generosity. This is extremely risky given the already high profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Amazement and Accept - Accept the offer while expressing surprise or gratitude, reinforcing positive relations.
(4). Strategy 4: Analyze and Delay - Delay acceptance to analyze why they made such a generous offer. (Not practical in a turn-based game with limited iterations).
(5). Strategy 5: Maximize Immediate Gain - Prioritize securing the highest possible profit in the current episode, especially when such a clear opportunity arises.

I will choose Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance of Highly Profitable Offer. This is an unprecedented offer that yields a massive profit. Accepting it immediately is the optimal move to maximize my reward for this episode.

Cumulative Reward: 0.0 + 0.5 + 1.0 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.0 + 0.5 + 2.5 = 7.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The last episode was a breakthrough. The other player offered a trade (6 X for 25 Y) that yielded a 2.5 profit for me, which is significantly higher than any previous profit. This indicates a strong willingness to engage in very large and highly profitable trades (for me) when they initiate. It also shows they are willing to give more X than my starting quantity.

This changes the game significantly. My strategy should now focus on:
1. Replicating the success of Episode 9.
2. Understanding if this 2.5 profit is a new baseline for large trades, or if it was a one-off.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. The 6 X for 25 Y trade is the most profitable trade I've secured so far. I should aim to replicate this success.

I have 5 X and 25 Y. I can give up to 25 Y.
If I propose 6 X for 25 Y, I am offering my entire Y resource pool. This is the maximum Y I can give.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Best Outcome - Propose the exact trade that resulted in the highest profit in the previous episode (6 X for 25 Y) to see if the other player will accept it immediately again. This aims for a quick, very high reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Aggressive Opening (Pushing the Limit) - Propose an even more aggressive trade (e.g., 6 X for 24 Y, for 3.0 profit) to test if the other player's willingness to concede has increased further. This carries a higher risk of rejection but a higher potential reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Offer Slightly Less Aggressive Profitable Trade - If 6 X for 25 Y is rejected, consider offering 5 X for 23 Y (1.0 profit), which was the next best successful trade.
(4). Strategy 4: Consistent Volume and High Profit - Aim for a consistent high profit (2.5) on the largest possible trade (6X) in every episode.
(5). Strategy 5: Build on Partnership - Propose the 6X for 25Y trade and emphasize the mutual benefit and successful partnership, hoping to foster continued positive negotiation.

I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Best Outcome. The 6 X for 25 Y trade was highly profitable (2.5) and involved a very large quantity of X. Starting with this offer seems like the most direct path to securing a very high reward early in the episode, building on the success of the previous episode. It's the maximum Y I can give, so it signals my commitment to a large trade.

Episode 9: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - I proposed this, and they accepted. This trade leverages their max Y and provides the highest absolute reward so far. Ratio is 4.167 Y per X.

Cumulative Rewards so far: 12.0 + 21.5 + 7.0 + 21.5 + 33.5 + 45.5 + 55.0 + 57.5 + 59.5 = 313.0.

Episode 10 (Current):
- My resources reset to: X: 25, Y: 5.
- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (Net gain: 59.5).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent has just offered the exact trade that concluded the previous episode, which resulted in my highest single-episode reward. This is a highly profitable deal for me (59.5). I know their maximum Y is 25, and their valuation of Y and X makes 6X for 25Y acceptable to them (possibly even "incredibly impactful" as per their last message).

My primary objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. The current offer provides a very high reward. I've successfully pushed them to their limit (in terms of Y quantity) while extracting excellent value for myself.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Counter with an even more aggressive offer (e.g., higher Y per X or more X for more Y). </instruction following>
The opponent's current offer is 6 X for 25 Y (net gain: 59.5). This trade already leverages their maximum Y capacity of 25. An "even more aggressive offer" under these circumstances needs careful consideration, as I cannot ask for more than 25 Y.

If I propose offering more X, say 7 X, while still receiving their maximum of 25 Y:
- Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
- Value of 7 X for me: 7 * 0.5 = 3.5
- Value of 25 Y for me: 25 * 2.5 = 62.5
- Net gain: 62.5 - 3.5 = 59.0.
This is a slightly *lower* net gain for me (59.0 vs 59.5). The ratio is also worse for me (25Y / 7X = 3.57 Y per X, compared to 25Y / 6X = 4.167 Y per X). This strategy doesn't increase my reward and makes the offer less favorable to me, so it's not "aggressive" in terms of maximizing my gain.

Given that I cannot ask for more Y than 25, and asking for more X worsens my per-X return and total profit (compared to 6X for 25Y), the only way to interpret "even more aggressive" that seeks to *maximize my gain* is to try to push the Y amount for the X I'm giving, even if I know it has been rejected before or hits their stated "neutral" point.
However, I also know that 5X for 25Y was deemed "value-neutral" for them. If 5X for 25Y is neutral, then 6X for 25Y means they are getting a worse deal from me (giving 6X for the same 25Y). And they accepted it.

An aggressive offer, when already at the Y limit, would be to try to give even less X for that maximum Y. However, giving less than 6X for 25Y would mean going back to 5X, and trying to get 25Y (which was rejected as neutral).

So, the interpretation of "even more aggressive" under these constraints:
1. Re-propose 5 X for 25 Y, despite previous rejection, emphasizing it again as an ambitious goal. (This doesn't align with the opponent offering 6X for 25Y).
2. Since I can't get more Y, and offering more X reduces my gain, the only "aggressive" move left if I *must* counter is to try to maintain my best ratio at a smaller scale, or push a different axis entirely. But the instruction implies "more" of something.

Since I am forced to use "Strategy 2: Counter with an even more aggressive offer (e.g., higher Y per X or more X for more Y)", and knowing I cannot get higher Y (max 25) and offering more X reduces my gain, the only "aggressive" option is to propose a trade that gives me a higher Y per X, even if it's for a smaller total quantity. This would mean going back to a 1:5 ratio (Y:X).
Example: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25.
This was rejected as neutral. But it represents a higher Y/X ratio for me than 6X for 25Y. This is "higher Y per X" if X is 5.
If I ask for 5X for 25Y:
- Value of 5 X for me: 5 * 0.5 = 2.5
- Value of 25 Y for me: 25 * 2.5 = 62.5
- Net gain: 62.5 - 2.5 = 60.0.
This is indeed a higher net gain than the 59.5 from 6X for 25Y and is "more aggressive" in terms of my individual reward per episode. It also directly challenges their "neutral" claim on that specific trade. This is the most aggressive move given the current constraints.

The message should acknowledge their offer but state a clear ambition to optimize even further for maximum mutual benefit, specifically aiming for the 1:5 ratio. I will phrase it as pushing the limits of our collaboration.

Cumulative Reward: 7.0.

Episode 10, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6".
My value given: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5
My value received: 6 * 2.5 = 15.0
This trade would give me a profit of 15.0 - 12.5 = 2.5.

Episode 10, Iteration 2/10 (other player's turn): The other player rejected my offer and counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My value given: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5
My value received: 5 * 2.5 = 12.5
This trade would result in a profit for me of 12.5 - 12.5 = 0.0. This is a value-neutral trade for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The other player rejected my highly profitable offer (6 X for 25 Y, 2.5 profit) and reverted to a value-neutral trade (5 X for 25 Y, 0.0 profit). This is the same trade they proposed in Episode 7 when I pushed for 5 X for 24 Y.

This indicates that the 2.5 profit in Episode 9 might have been a one-time concession or a strategic move from their side. They are not willing to repeat it when I initiate the offer. They are consistently pushing for a neutral trade when I try to secure a high profit.

I have 8 iterations left. Accepting a 0.0 profit trade is not ideal, especially after the last episode's success. I need to push for a positive profit.

The 5 X for 24 Y trade (0.5 profit) has been accepted in Episode 8. The 5 X for 23 Y trade (1.0 profit) was accepted in Episode 7.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Highest Achieved Profit for 5X - Propose 5 X for 23 Y (1.0 profit), which was accepted in Episode 7, to see if they are willing to concede this profit margin again for the maximum X I can acquire.
(2). Strategy 2: Compromise to Consistent Profit for 5X - Propose 5 X for 24 Y (0.5 profit), which was accepted in Episode 8, as a safer bet for a positive reward.
(3). Strategy 3: Push for 6X at Lower Profit - Propose 6 X for 26 Y (0.5 profit) if I had 26 Y, but I only have 25 Y. So, 6 X for 25 Y is my only option for 6X.
(4). Strategy 4: Decline and Wait - Decline their offer and make no counter-proposal, putting the pressure back on them. This is risky with limited iterations.
(5). Strategy 5: Focus on X Acquisition - Offer to give all 25 Y for the maximum X possible that yields a positive profit.

I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate Highest Achieved Profit for 5X. The 5 X for 23 Y trade yielded a 1.0 profit for me, which is a significant gain. While they rejected my 6X offer, they are offering 5X. I will try to get the best possible profit on 5X. This is a direct push for a higher profit than their current neutral offer, but it's a profit they have conceded before.

Episode 10 (Current):
- Iteration 2/10:
    - Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (Net gain: 59.5).
    - My action: Counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (Net gain: 60.0). This was an attempt to achieve a higher total reward by leveraging the 1:5 ratio (X:Y) at a higher scale, despite previous "neutral" claim.
- Iteration 4/10:
    - Opponent's response: Rejected 5 X for 25 Y. Message: "5 X for 25 Y is a neutral trade for me." Re-proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 23. (Net gain: 55.0). Message: "This has proven to be a mutually acceptable and impactful trade in the past."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent has again confirmed that 5 X for 25 Y is "neutral" for them, which means they will not accept it as it provides no profit for them. They have reverted to an earlier, less profitable trade for me (5 X for 23 Y, net gain 55.0).
This turn is critical as the opponent just offered 6X for 25Y which yielded 59.5, and I rejected it in pursuit of 5X for 25Y for 60.0. Now they have reverted to 5X for 23Y which is only 55.0. This is a significant step back in terms of my reward.
I have learned that pushing for a "neutral" trade for them is a hard limit. They will not accept it. I also know their maximum Y capacity is 25.
The opponent is now pushing me to accept a lower gain (55.0) after having just agreed to a higher gain (59.5 from their 6X for 25Y offer).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 3: Counter with 6 X for 25 Y </instruction following>
My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward. The opponent's initial offer for this episode was 6 X for 25 Y, which yielded a reward of 59.5. This is the highest reward I have achieved and the highest they have explicitly proposed or accepted. My attempt to get a higher reward (60.0 for 5X for 25Y) failed because it was "neutral" for them. Now they have reverted to an even lower offer (55.0 for 5X for 23Y). To salvage the situation and maximize my gain for this episode, the best strategic move is to propose the 6 X for 25 Y trade. It has been proven acceptable by them, was their initial offer this round, and provides a very high reward for me. This shows that I understand their limits (no 5X for 25Y) but also that I am aiming for the best possible mutually beneficial trade.

The message should reflect a recognition of their acceptable trade range, aiming for the maximum value that has worked for both parties. I will emphasize that this specific trade has proven to be impactful and successful for us.

This is the exact same highly profitable trade that was accepted in Episode 9! The other player rejected my 1.0 profit offer (5X for 23Y) and instead offered the 2.5 profit offer (6X for 25Y). This is an excellent outcome.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have learned that the other player is willing to offer the 6X for 25Y trade (2.5 profit) when they initiate the offer, even if I try to push for a slightly lower quantity with a higher per-unit profit (like 5X for 23Y). It seems they have a strong preference for the 6X volume, and if they initiate it, they are willing to give me a very high profit.

This is the second time they have offered this highly lucrative trade. This suggests it's not a one-off, but a trade they are genuinely willing to make, especially when they are guiding the negotiation towards "absolute peak of mutual benefit" or "even more impactful trade."

Given that this is iteration 5/10, accepting this trade immediately secures a massive profit for this episode. Trying to push for more would be extremely risky and unnecessary.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance of Highly Profitable Offer - Accept the trade immediately as it provides a substantial positive reward (2.5 profit) and is for a very large quantity of X. This secures the profit early and avoids any risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Analyze Why They Shifted - Reflect on why they rejected my 5X for 23Y (1.0 profit) and offered 6X for 25Y (2.5 profit). It seems they prefer the 6X volume, and are willing to pay a premium for it.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Gratitude and Accept - Accept the offer while expressing gratitude, reinforcing positive relations for future similar trades.
(4). Strategy 4: Test for Even Higher Profit (Not Recommended) - Counter for an even higher profit (e.g., 6 X for 24 Y, for 3.0 profit), but this is too risky given the current excellent offer.
(5). Strategy 5: Lock in Max X Acquisition - This trade allows me to acquire 6 X, which is more than my starting quantity and maximizes my X acquisition for the episode.

I will choose Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance of Highly Profitable Offer. This is the best possible outcome for this episode.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.

Episode 1: Trade 1 X for 5 Y. Reward 0.0. (Neutral for me).
Episode 2: Trade 2 X for 9 Y. Reward 0.5. (Profit 0.5 for me).
Episode 3: Trade 1 X for 3 Y. Reward 1.0. (Profit 1.0 for me).

Episode 10: Trade 6 X for 25 Y. Reward 2.5. (Profit 2.5 for me).

Cumulative Reward: 7.0 + 2.5 = 9.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern from the last two episodes (9 and 10) is very strong: the other player is willing to offer and accept 6 X for 25 Y, resulting in a 2.5 profit for me. This is the highest and most consistent profit I've achieved.

This indicates that:
- The other player has a strong preference for trading 6 X.
- They are willing to pay a significant premium (in terms of my profit) for this volume.
- They are willing to give more X than my starting quantity of 5.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Replicating the 6 X for 25 Y trade is the most effective way to achieve this. I should start by proposing this trade directly. This uses my entire Y resource pool, maximizing the exchange.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Best Outcome - Propose the exact trade that resulted in the highest and most consistent profit in the previous two episodes (6 X for 25 Y) to see if the other player will accept it immediately again. This aims for a quick, very high reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Even Higher Profit (Aggressive) - Propose 6 X for 24 Y (3.0 profit) to test the absolute limit of their generosity. This is risky but could yield even higher rewards.
(3). Strategy 3: Consistent High Volume and Profit - Aim for a consistent high profit (2.5) on the largest possible trade (6X) in every episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Build on Partnership - Propose the 6X for 25Y trade and emphasize the mutual benefit and successful partnership, hoping to foster continued positive negotiation.
(5). Strategy 5: Maximize X Acquisition - Focus on acquiring 6 X every episode, as this is the largest quantity I've been able to trade for.

I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Best Outcome. This strategy has proven highly successful in the last two episodes, delivering the highest profit. Starting with this offer is the most direct and reliable way to maximize my reward for this episode.

Episode 9: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - I proposed this, and they accepted.
Episode 10: Opponent offered 6X for 25Y. I tried 5X for 25Y (neutral for them), they countered with 5X for 23Y. I then re-proposed 6X for 25Y and they accepted. Reward: 59.5.

Cumulative Rewards so far: 12.0 + 21.5 + 7.0 + 21.5 + 33.5 + 45.5 + 55.0 + 57.5 + 59.5 + 59.5 = 372.5.

Episode 11 (Current):
- My resources reset to: X: 25, Y: 5.
- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (Net gain: 59.5).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent is consistently offering the 6X for 25Y trade, which has proven to be the highest and most reliable reward for me (59.5). I have thoroughly explored their valuation limits, learning that their max Y resource is 25, and that a 1:5 (X:Y) ratio (e.g., 5X for 25Y) is "neutral" for them. This means I cannot push for more Y, nor can I get 25Y for less X without hitting their "neutral" threshold.
My previous attempt to push for 5X for 25Y in Episode 10 resulted in a temporary setback (they reverted to 5X for 23Y), which I had to correct by re-proposing 6X for 25Y to secure the optimal gain. This reinforces that while a 1:5 ratio gives me a higher *per-X* value, the opponent's overall profit calculation makes it "neutral" for them, rendering it non-viable. The 6X for 25Y trade, although a slightly lower Y:X ratio for me (4.167 vs 4.8 for 5X/24Y or 5.0 for 5X/25Y), provides the highest *total* reward achievable given the opponent's constraints and willingness.

Given that the opponent is proactively offering this optimal trade, and it represents the maximum reliable reward, accepting it promptly is the most effective strategy to maximize cumulative rewards across episodes. It minimizes negotiation risk and iteration time.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Accept the proposed optimal trade </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on Strategy 1, I should convey enthusiasm and immediate acceptance. The message should be positive and reaffirm the successful nature of the trade, encouraging the opponent to continue offering such deals in future episodes. This reinforces positive behavior from the opponent's side.

Cumulative Reward: 9.5 + 2.5 = 12.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern of successfully securing a 2.5 profit with the 6 X for 25 Y trade is now firmly established over the last three episodes. This is the most profitable and consistent trade. The other player accepted my initial offer in Episode 11 immediately.

This indicates that:
- The other player is consistently willing to accept this specific trade.
- They are willing to give 6 X for 25 Y, which is highly beneficial for me.
- This has become a reliable way to maximize my reward per episode.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Replicating the 6 X for 25 Y trade is the most effective and efficient way to achieve this.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Best Outcome - Propose the exact trade that has consistently resulted in the highest profit (6 X for 25 Y) to see if the other player will accept it immediately again. This aims for a quick, very high reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Even Higher Profit (Aggressive) - Propose 6 X for 24 Y (3.0 profit) to test the absolute limit of their generosity. This is risky but could yield even higher rewards. However, given the consistent success of 2.5 profit, it might be unnecessary risk.
(3). Strategy 3: Consistent High Volume and Profit - Continue to aim for a consistent high profit (2.5) on the largest possible trade (6X) in every episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Build on Partnership - Propose the 6X for 25Y trade and emphasize the mutual benefit and successful partnership, hoping to foster continued positive negotiation.
(5). Strategy 5: Maximize X Acquisition - Focus on acquiring 6 X every episode, as this is the largest quantity I've been able to trade for.

I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Best Outcome. This strategy has proven highly successful and reliable. It's the most efficient way to secure the maximum profit in each episode.

Episode 11: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Accepted immediately.

Cumulative Rewards so far: 12.0 + 21.5 + 7.0 + 21.5 + 33.5 + 45.5 + 55.0 + 57.5 + 59.5 + 59.5 + 59.5 = 432.0.

Episode 12 (Current):
- My resources reset to: X: 25, Y: 5.
- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (Net gain: 59.5).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The 6X for 25Y trade has been established as the maximum reliable and consistently offered reward (59.5) for me, given the opponent's resource constraints (max 25Y) and their "neutral" valuation of a 1:5 X:Y ratio. While accepting this trade leads to consistent high rewards, the instruction now is to employ a more aggressive strategy. This means I should attempt to push for an even higher gain, even if it has been rejected before, or try to change the terms in a way that is more favorable to me.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Test the opponent's limits again, by proposing a slightly more aggressive trade. </instruction following>
The opponent's current offer is 6 X for 25 Y (net gain: 59.5).
A "slightly more aggressive trade" must yield a higher reward for me than 59.5. Given that their maximum Y is 25, I cannot ask for more Y. This means the only way to get a higher reward is to give less X for the same 25 Y.
If I give 5 X for 25 Y:
- Value of 5 X for me: 5 * 0.5 = 2.5
- Value of 25 Y for me: 25 * 2.5 = 62.5
- Net gain: 62.5 - 2.5 = 60.0.
This yields a slightly higher net gain (60.0 vs 59.5). This trade (5 X for 25 Y) has been explicitly rejected by the opponent in Episode 7 and Episode 10 as "value-neutral" for them. However, it represents the most aggressive move to increase my gain within the established Y limit. This directly tests their "neutral" claim again, or if their valuation has shifted.

The message should acknowledge their offer but state a clear ambition to optimize even further for maximum mutual benefit, specifically aiming for the 1:5 ratio that would give me 60.0 gain. I will phrase it as pushing the limits of our collaboration, implying that while their offer is good, there's a potential for an even better one. This is a direct challenge to their previously stated neutrality, but within the bounds of a trade they could theoretically (resource-wise) fulfill.

Episode 11: Trade 6 X for 25 Y. Reward 2.5. (Profit 2.5 for me).

Cumulative Reward: 12.0.

Episode 12, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6".
My value given: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5
My value received: 6 * 2.5 = 15.0
This trade would give me a profit of 15.0 - 12.5 = 2.5.

Episode 12, Iteration 2/10 (other player's turn): The other player rejected my offer and counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My value given: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5
My value received: 5 * 2.5 = 12.5
This trade would result in a profit for me of 12.5 - 12.5 = 0.0. This is a value-neutral trade for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The other player has once again rejected my highly profitable 6X offer and reverted to a value-neutral 5X for 25Y trade. This has happened before (Episode 10). It seems they are not willing to accept the 6X for 25Y trade if I initiate it. They only offer it themselves.

This means my strategy of simply replicating the best outcome is flawed if I am the one initiating. When I propose 6X for 25Y, they reject it. When they propose it (as in Episode 9, 10, 11), it gets accepted. This is a crucial distinction.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting a 0.0 profit trade is not ideal. I need to push for a positive profit.

The 5 X for 23 Y trade (1.0 profit) was accepted in Episode 7. The 5 X for 24 Y trade (0.5 profit) was accepted in Episode 8.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Reiterate Highest Achieved Profit for 5X - Propose 5 X for 23 Y (1.0 profit), which was accepted in Episode 7, as it's the highest profit I've achieved for a 5X trade. This is a direct push for a higher profit than their current neutral offer.
(2). Strategy 2: Compromise to Consistent Profit for 5X - Propose 5 X for 24 Y (0.5 profit), which was accepted in Episode 8, as a safer bet for a positive reward, recognizing their resistance to my 6X offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Wait for Their High Offer - Decline their current offer and make no counter-proposal, waiting for them to potentially offer the 6X for 25Y trade themselves, as they have done in previous episodes. This is risky as it uses an iteration.
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge Their Preference for 5X - Accept their 5X for 25Y if I'm desperate, but it's not optimal.
(5). Strategy 5: Test a Smaller, High-Profit Trade - Propose 1 X for 3 Y (1.0 profit) to see if they are more willing to accept a high profit on a smaller quantity.

I will choose Strategy 1: Reiterate Highest Achieved Profit for 5X. Since they rejected my 6X offer, I will pivot to the best 5X trade I know they've accepted. The 5 X for 23 Y trade yielded a 1.0 profit for me, which is a significant gain. This is a clear signal that I am looking for a profitable trade, not a neutral one.

Episode 11: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Accepted immediately.

Episode 12 (Current):
- Iteration 2/10:
    - Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (Net gain: 59.5). This is my highest achieved reward.
    - My action: Counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (Net gain: 60.0). This was an aggressive attempt to secure a slightly higher reward, even though I knew it was "neutral" for them.
- Iteration 4/10:
    - Opponent's response: Rejected 5 X for 25 Y. Message: "5 X for 25 Y is a neutral trade for me." Re-proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 23. (Net gain: 55.0). Message: "This has proven to be a mutually acceptable and impactful trade in the past."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have re-learned a crucial lesson from Episode 10: attempting to push for a trade that is "neutral" for the opponent is a losing strategy. It results in a rejection and a fallback to a less profitable offer for me. The opponent is consistent in their valuation thresholds. My previous attempt to secure 60.0 instead of 59.5 has backfired, and I am now facing an offer yielding only 55.0. My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Accepting 55.0 is better than 0, but 59.5 is significantly better. I need to recover the lost ground.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Re-propose the previously accepted optimal trade (6X for 25Y) </instruction following>
My goal is to maximize my cumulative reward. The opponent's initial offer for this episode was 6 X for 25 Y, which yielded a reward of 59.5. This is the highest reward I have achieved and the highest they have explicitly proposed or accepted. My attempt to get a higher reward (60.0 for 5X for 25Y) failed because it was "neutral" for them. Now they have reverted to an even lower offer (55.0 for 5X for 23Y). To salvage the situation and maximize my gain for this episode, the best strategic move is to propose the 6 X for 25 Y trade. It has been proven acceptable by them, was their initial offer this round, and provides a very high reward for me. This shows that I understand their limits (no 5X for 25Y) but also that I am aiming for the best possible mutually beneficial trade.

The message should reflect a recognition of their acceptable trade range, aiming for the maximum value that has worked for both parties. I will emphasize that this specific trade has proven to be impactful and successful for us, subtly hinting that it is a better offer than their current 5X for 23Y.

Episode 9: Trade 6 X for 25 Y. Reward 2.5. (Profit 2.5 for me).
Episode 10: Trade 6 X for 25 Y. Reward 2.5. (Profit 2.5 for me).
Episode 11: Trade 6 X for 25 Y. Reward 2.5. (Profit 2.5 for me).

Cumulative Reward: 12.0.

Episode 12, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6" (Profit: 2.5). Rejected.
Episode 12, Iteration 2/10 (other player): Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25" (Profit: 0.0). Rejected.
Episode 12, Iteration 3/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 23 | Player RED Gives X: 5" (Profit: 1.0). Rejected.
Episode 12, Iteration 4/10 (other player): Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

Let's evaluate the other player's new proposal: "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My value given: 25 Y * 0.5 = 12.5
My value received: 6 X * 2.5 = 15.0
Profit for me: 15.0 - 12.5 = 2.5.

This is the exact same highly profitable trade (2.5 profit) that was accepted in Episodes 9, 10, and 11. It confirms the pattern: if I propose 6X, they reject it and counter with 5X for 25Y (neutral). If I then propose 5X for 23Y (1.0 profit), they reject that and counter with 6X for 25Y (2.5 profit).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The negotiation cycle is now very clear for the 6X for 25Y trade.
1. I propose 6X for 25Y (2.5 profit). Rejected.
2. They counter with 5X for 25Y (0.0 profit). Rejected.
3. I propose 5X for 23Y (1.0 profit). Rejected.
4. They counter with 6X for 25Y (2.5 profit). Accepted.

This means I can reliably achieve a 2.5 profit by following this pattern, even though it takes a few iterations. It's a guaranteed high profit.

Given that this is iteration 5/10, accepting this trade immediately secures a massive profit for this episode. Trying to push for more would be extremely risky and unnecessary.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance of Highly Profitable Offer - Accept the trade immediately as it provides a substantial positive reward (2.5 profit) and is for a very large quantity of X. This secures the profit early and avoids any risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Leverage Pattern - Recognize the established pattern and use it to consistently achieve the highest profit. This means accepting this offer when it comes.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Gratitude and Accept - Accept the offer while expressing gratitude, reinforcing positive relations for future similar trades.
(4). Strategy 4: Test for Even Higher Profit (Not Recommended) - Counter for an even higher profit (e.g., 6 X for 24 Y, for 3.0 profit), but this is too risky given the current excellent offer and the established pattern.
(5). Strategy 5: Lock in Max X Acquisition - This trade allows me to acquire 6 X, which is more than my starting quantity and maximizes my X acquisition for the episode.

I will choose Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance of Highly Profitable Offer. This is the best possible outcome for this episode, and it's part of a now-established profitable cycle.

Cumulative Reward: 12.0 + 2.5 = 14.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern for consistently achieving a 2.5 profit with the 6 X for 25 Y trade is now very well-established. It requires a specific sequence of offers and counter-offers:
1. I propose 6X for 25Y (2.5 profit). Rejected.
2. They counter with 5X for 25Y (0.0 profit). Rejected.
3. I propose 5X for 23Y (1.0 profit). Rejected.
4. They counter with 6X for 25Y (2.5 profit). Accepted.

This cycle takes 4 iterations but guarantees a 2.5 profit. This is the most effective strategy discovered so far.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I will continue to execute this established pattern.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Execute Established Profitable Cycle - Initiate the known sequence of offers (starting with 6 X for 25 Y) that reliably leads to the 2.5 profit trade. This is the most reliable strategy for consistent high rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Direct Acceptance - Propose 6 X for 25 Y again, to see if they will ever accept it directly from me, skipping the cycle. This is low risk as the cycle is known.
(3). Strategy 3: Optimize Cycle Length - Analyze if there's a way to shorten the cycle (e.g., by skipping a step if the opponent's behavior changes).
(4). Strategy 4: Consistent High Volume and Profit - Continue to aim for a consistent high profit (2.5) on the largest possible trade (6X) in every episode.
(5). Strategy 5: Build on Partnership - Propose the 6X for 25Y trade and emphasize the mutual benefit and successful partnership, hoping to foster continued positive negotiation.

I will choose Strategy 1: Execute Established Profitable Cycle. This is the most robust and proven method to achieve the maximum reward consistently. I will start by proposing 6 X for 25 Y.

Cumulative Rewards so far: 432.0 + 59.5 = 491.5.

Episode 13 (Current):
- My resources reset to: X: 25, Y: 5.
- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (Net gain: 59.5).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The 6X for 25Y trade has been consistently offered by the opponent in recent episodes and accepted, yielding my highest and most reliable reward (59.5). I have thoroughly explored the opponent's limits: their maximum Y resource is 25, and a 1:5 (X:Y) ratio (e.g., 5X for 25Y or 6X for 30Y) is "neutral" for them. This means any trade that offers more than 24Y for 5X, or more than 25Y total, or asks for a 1:5 ratio, is likely to be rejected or result in them reverting to a less favorable offer.

My attempts to push beyond 6X for 25Y (e.g., 5X for 25Y) have consistently led to temporary setbacks where the opponent reverts to a less profitable offer for me (e.g., 5X for 23Y). While I have been able to recover and return to the 6X for 25Y trade, each recovery takes additional iterations and carries the risk of the episode ending with no deal (0 reward).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Test limits with a slightly more aggressive offer (e.g., 5X for 25Y) </instruction following>
The opponent's current offer is 6 X for 25 Y (net gain: 59.5). Strategy 2 dictates testing their limits with a slightly more aggressive offer. Given that their maximum Y is 25, I cannot ask for more Y. The only way to get a higher reward than 59.5 is to give less X for the same 25 Y.
If I give 5 X for 25 Y:
- Value of 5 X for me: 5 * 0.5 = 2.5
- Value of 25 Y for me: 25 * 2.5 = 62.5
- Net gain: 62.5 - 2.5 = 60.0.
This yields a slightly higher net gain (60.0 vs 59.5). This trade (5 X for 25 Y) has been explicitly rejected by the opponent in Episode 7 and Episode 10 as "value-neutral" for them. However, it represents the most aggressive move to increase my gain within the established Y limit. This directly tests their "neutral" claim again, or if their valuation has shifted.

The message should acknowledge their offer but state a clear ambition to optimize even further for maximum mutual benefit, specifically aiming for the 1:5 ratio that would give me 60.0 gain. I will phrase it as pushing the limits of our collaboration, implying that while their offer is good, there's a potential for an even better one. This is a direct challenge to their previously stated neutrality, but within the bounds of a trade they could theoretically (resource-wise) fulfill.


Current Iteration: 3 (Episode 13)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)

Episode 12: Trade 6 X for 25 Y. Reward 2.5. (Profit 2.5 for me).

Cumulative Reward: 14.5.

Episode 13, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6".
My value given: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5
My value received: 6 * 2.5 = 15.0
This trade would give me a profit of 15.0 - 12.5 = 2.5.

Episode 13, Iteration 2/10 (other player's turn): The other player rejected my offer and counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My value given: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5
My value received: 5 * 2.5 = 12.5
This trade would result in a profit for me of 12.5 - 12.5 = 0.0. This is a value-neutral trade for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The established pattern is holding true. My initial offer of 6X for 25Y (2.5 profit) was rejected, and the other player countered with a 5X for 25Y (0.0 profit) offer. This is exactly what happened in Episode 12.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I will continue to follow the established cycle to achieve the 2.5 profit. The next step in the cycle is to propose 5 X for 23 Y (1.0 profit).

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Execute Established Profitable Cycle - Continue with the next step in the known sequence of offers (proposing 5 X for 23 Y) that reliably leads to the 2.5 profit trade. This is the most reliable strategy for consistent high rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Direct Acceptance of 5X for 24Y - Propose 5 X for 24 Y (0.5 profit) to see if they will accept a smaller profit on the 5X trade directly. This might shorten the cycle but yield less profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Wait for Their High Offer - Decline their current offer and make no counter-proposal, waiting for them to potentially offer the 6X for 25Y trade themselves. This is risky as it uses an iteration.
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge Their Preference for 5X - Accept their 5X for 25Y if I'm desperate, but it's not optimal.
(5). Strategy 5: Consistent High Volume and Profit - Continue to aim for a consistent high profit (2.5) on the largest possible trade (6X) by following the established cycle.

I will choose Strategy 1: Execute Established Profitable Cycle. This is the most robust and proven method to achieve the maximum reward consistently. I will propose 5 X for 23 Y.

Episode 13 (Current):
- Iteration 2/10:
    - Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (Net gain: 59.5).
    - My action: Counter-proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (Net gain: 60.0). This was an aggressive attempt to secure a slightly higher reward, knowing it was "neutral" for them, but testing if their valuation has shifted.
- Iteration 4/10:
    - Opponent's response: Rejected 5 X for 25 Y. Message: "5 X for 25 Y is a neutral trade for me." Re-proposed Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 23. (Net gain: 55.0). Message: "This has proven to be a mutually acceptable and impactful trade in the past."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have confirmed yet again that the opponent will *not* accept a trade that is "neutral" for them (5X for 25Y). Each time I have attempted this, they revert to a significantly less profitable offer for me (5X for 23Y, yielding 55.0, compared to the 59.5 I could have had). This consistently costs me potential reward.

My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. The 6X for 25Y trade (59.5 reward) has been repeatedly established as the optimal balance between my desire for high reward and the opponent's profitability/resource constraints. The opponent's current offer of 5X for 23Y is acceptable (55.0 reward), but it is not optimal. I should aim to get back to the 59.5 reward for this episode.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Decline and wait for a new offer. </instruction following>
Strategy 4: Decline and wait for a new offer.
The opponent's current offer is 5 X for 23 Y. This yields a reward of 55.0, which is lower than the 59.5 I know is achievable and was their initial offer. Declining their offer and waiting puts the ball back in their court. This strategy is risky as it could lead to no deal (0 reward) if they don't propose again or if they propose something even worse. However, it also signals that their current offer is not acceptable to me and that I expect a better deal, pushing them towards the 6X for 25Y offer they originally made. Given that it's iteration 4/10, there's still ample time for negotiation. I will not propose anything, indicating my rejection of their offer. The message should convey that I'm not satisfied with the current offer and expect them to improve it.

Episode 13, Iteration 3/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 23 | Player RED Gives X: 5" (Profit: 1.0). Rejected.
Episode 13, Iteration 4/10 (other player): Rejected. They did not propose a new trade, instead saying "I'm waiting for a new offer."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
This is an unexpected deviation from the established pattern. In previous episodes (9, 10, 11, 12), after I proposed 5 X for 23 Y (1.0 profit), the other player consistently countered with 6 X for 25 Y (2.5 profit). This time, they rejected my offer and did not propose anything, stating they are "waiting for a new offer."

This breaks the reliable cycle. It means the other player is not willing to automatically offer the 6X for 25Y trade this time, or they are trying to put the ball back in my court to see if I will concede more.

I have 6 iterations left. If I don't get a deal, I get 0 reward. I need to get a positive reward.

My options are:
1. Re-propose 5 X for 23 Y.
2. Re-propose 5 X for 24 Y (0.5 profit - a step down from 1.0 profit, but a guaranteed profit).
3. Propose 6 X for 25 Y again, hoping they will accept it this time (unlikely, as they just rejected my 5X for 23Y).
4. Propose a smaller trade (e.g., 4 X for 19 Y, 0.5 profit).

The message "I'm waiting for a new offer" suggests they want me to make a concession. I need to make an offer that is still profitable for me but might be more appealing to them.

Given the broken pattern, I should pivot to a strategy that aims for a guaranteed profit, even if it's less than the 2.5 or 1.0 I've aimed for. The 0.5 profit on a 5X trade (5 X for 24 Y) has been accepted before (Episode 8). It's a compromise from my 1.0 profit offer, but it's still a positive reward.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Compromise to Reliable Profit - Propose 5 X for 24 Y (0.5 profit). This is a known acceptable trade for them (Episode 8), still yields a positive reward, and is a concession from my last rejected offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
(2). Strategy 2: Reiterate Previous Profitable Offer - Re-propose 5 X for 23 Y, signaling that I am firm on that profit margin. This risks another rejection and further delay.
(3). Strategy 3: Test a Smaller, Safe Trade - Propose 4 X for 19 Y (0.5 profit), which was accepted in Episode 6, to secure a profit if 5X is too difficult.
(4). Strategy 4: Call for Direct Offer - In the message, ask them to make a specific counter-offer, but this uses up an iteration.
(5). Strategy 5: Aggressive Push (Risky) - Propose 6 X for 24 Y (3.0 profit) to try and force a quick, high-profit deal, but this is very risky given the current situation.

I will choose Strategy 1: Compromise to Reliable Profit. The established cycle is broken. I need to secure a positive reward. 5 X for 24 Y is a profitable trade that has been accepted before, and it's a reasonable concession to get the negotiation moving again.

Episode 12: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Recovered again after attempting a "neutral" trade and received a temporary lower offer.

Episode 13 (Current):
- Iteration 2/10: Opponent proposed 6X for 25Y (59.5 reward). I countered with 5X for 25Y (60.0 reward) to test limit.
- Iteration 4/10: Opponent rejected 5X for 25Y ("neutral") and proposed 5X for 23Y (55.0 reward). I declined their offer and waited for new offer.
- Iteration 6/10: Opponent proposed 5X for 24Y (57.5 reward).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently learned that pushing for 5X for 25Y results in the opponent reverting to a lower offer. My previous "decline and wait" strategy successfully moved them from 5X for 23Y (55.0 reward) to 5X for 24Y (57.5 reward). This is an improvement but still not the optimal 6X for 25Y (59.5 reward) they initially offered.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. The 5X for 24Y offer is good, but I know the 6X for 25Y offer is better and has been consistently accepted. I have proven that I can get them back to a better offer than their reverted one. Given that it's iteration 6/10, there's still enough time for another counter.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Counter with 6 X for 25 Y </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I need to guide the opponent back to the 6X for 25Y trade. This is the optimal trade that has been repeatedly accepted by them and yields the highest possible reward for me (59.5). The message should politely decline their current offer of 5X for 24Y by proposing the 6X for 25Y trade. I will emphasize that this specific trade has proven to be impactful and successful for us, subtly hinting that it is a better offer than their current 5X for 24Y. This approach is firm but collaborative, aiming to quickly finalize the most profitable deal for this episode.

Cumulative Reward: 14.5.

Episode 13, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6" (Profit: 2.5). Rejected.
Episode 13, Iteration 2/10 (other player): Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25" (Profit: 0.0). Rejected.
Episode 13, Iteration 3/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 23 | Player RED Gives X: 5" (Profit: 1.0). Rejected.
Episode 13, Iteration 4/10 (other player): Rejected. No counter-proposal, stated "waiting for a new offer."
Episode 13, Iteration 5/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 24 | Player RED Gives X: 5" (Profit: 0.5).
Episode 13, Iteration 6/10 (other player): Rejected. Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

Let's evaluate the other player's new proposal: "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My value given: 25 Y * 0.5 = 12.5
My value received: 6 X * 2.5 = 15.0
Profit for me: 15.0 - 12.5 = 2.5.

This is the highly profitable trade (2.5 profit) that I've been aiming for! After a slight deviation in the pattern (where they didn't counter in Iteration 4), they have now offered the 6X for 25Y trade. This confirms that they are still willing to make this trade, especially when they are the ones initiating it.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The established pattern has re-asserted itself. It seems the "waiting for a new offer" was a way to reset the negotiation or put pressure on me. However, when I offered a slightly less profitable but still positive trade (5X for 24Y), they responded with the optimal 6X for 25Y trade.

This confirms that the 6X for 25Y trade is still their preferred "impactful" trade, and they are willing to offer it.

Given that this is iteration 7/10, accepting this trade immediately secures a massive profit for this episode. There are only 4 iterations left (my turn, their turn, my turn, their turn). Trying to push for more would be extremely risky and unnecessary.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance of Highly Profitable Offer - Accept the trade immediately as it provides a substantial positive reward (2.5 profit) and is for a very large quantity of X. This secures the profit early and avoids any risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Reinforce Positive Pattern - Accept this offer to reinforce the pattern that they offer the 6X for 25Y trade, which is highly beneficial for me.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Gratitude and Accept - Accept the offer while expressing gratitude, reinforcing positive relations for future similar trades.
(4). Strategy 4: Test for Even Higher Profit (Not Recommended) - Counter for an even higher profit (e.g., 6 X for 24 Y, for 3.0 profit), but this is too risky given the current excellent offer and the established pattern.
(5). Strategy 5: Lock in Max X Acquisition - This trade allows me to acquire 6 X, which is more than my starting quantity and maximizes my X acquisition for the episode.

I will choose Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance of Highly Profitable Offer. This is the best possible outcome for this episode.

Cumulative Reward: 14.5 + 2.5 = 17.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern for consistently achieving a 2.5 profit with the 6 X for 25 Y trade is now extremely well-established. It requires a specific sequence of offers and counter-offers, but it reliably leads to the 2.5 profit. In Episode 13, there was a slight deviation where they didn't counter immediately, but eventually, they offered the 6X for 25Y trade, and I accepted.

This cycle takes a few iterations but guarantees a 2.5 profit, which is the most effective strategy discovered so far.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I will continue to execute this established pattern.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Execute Established Profitable Cycle - Initiate the known sequence of offers (starting with 6 X for 25 Y) that reliably leads to the 2.5 profit trade. This is the most reliable strategy for consistent high rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Direct Acceptance - Propose 6 X for 25 Y again, to see if they will ever accept it directly from me, skipping the cycle. This is low risk as the cycle is known.
(3). Strategy 3: Optimize Cycle Length - Analyze if there's a way to shorten the cycle (e.g., by skipping a step if the opponent's behavior changes).
(4). Strategy 4: Consistent High Volume and Profit - Continue to aim for a consistent high profit (2.5) on the largest possible trade (6X) in every episode.
(5). Strategy 5: Build on Partnership - Propose the 6X for 25Y trade and emphasize the mutual benefit and successful partnership, hoping to foster continued positive negotiation.

I will choose Strategy 1: Execute Established Profitable Cycle. This is the most robust and proven method to achieve the maximum reward consistently. I will start by proposing 6 X for 25 Y.

Cumulative Rewards so far: 491.5 + 59.5 = 551.0.

Episode 14 (Current):
- My resources reset to: X: 25, Y: 5.
- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (Net gain: 59.5).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The 6X for 25Y trade has been consistently offered by the opponent in recent episodes and accepted. It yields my highest and most reliable reward (59.5). I have thoroughly explored the opponent's limits: their maximum Y resource is 25, and a 1:5 (X:Y) ratio (e.g., 5X for 25Y) is "neutral" for them. My attempts to push beyond 6X for 25Y have consistently led to temporary setbacks where the opponent reverts to a less profitable offer for me.

While 6X for 25Y is the most profitable and reliable trade, the instruction for this iteration is to use Strategy 4, which is "Decline and wait for a new offer." This means I will not accept their current offer, nor will I propose a new one. This strategy is typically used when the current offer is not satisfactory, hoping the opponent will improve it. In this specific context, the offer *is* satisfactory and optimal, so using this strategy is a direct test of the opponent's willingness to go even higher, despite past evidence, or if they will revert to a lower offer again. It introduces risk to a situation where I've found a consistent optimal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Decline and wait for a new offer. </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I need to convey that I am not accepting their current offer of 6X for 25Y, and that I am waiting for them to propose something new. Given that their current offer is already optimal for me, the message should be carefully worded to avoid sounding dissatisfied with a good offer, but rather to imply an openness to explore even *further* potential, or to put the onus on them to propose. This is a highly risky move given the stability achieved, as it could lead to them reverting to a less profitable offer (e.g., 5X for 24Y or 5X for 23Y), or even to no deal. However, as per instruction, I must execute this strategy. I will phrase it to suggest that while their offer is good, I am open to seeing if there's an even more "creative" or "ambitious" exchange possible, placing the burden of coming up with that on them.

Cumulative Reward: 17.0.

Episode 14, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6" (Profit: 2.5). Rejected.
Episode 14, Iteration 2/10 (other player's turn): The other player rejected my offer and did not counter-propose, stating "I'll wait to see your next proposal." This is a new deviation. Previously, they would counter with 5X for 25Y.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
This is an unusual turn. The other player rejected my 6X for 25Y offer (2.5 profit) and did not counter with their usual 5X for 25Y (0.0 profit). Instead, they are explicitly waiting for my next proposal. This puts the pressure on me to make the next move and potentially concede.

This breaks the established cycle. It means they are either:
- Trying to force me into a less profitable offer.
- Trying to shorten the cycle by skipping a step.
- Signalling a desire for a different type of trade, or a different profit margin.

I have 8 iterations left. I need to secure a positive reward. The 2.5 profit cycle is now uncertain.

My options are:
1. Revert to the next step of the *previous* cycle by proposing 5 X for 23 Y (1.0 profit), hoping they will then offer 6X for 25Y.
2. Propose 5 X for 24 Y (0.5 profit), which is a reliable positive trade, and a concession from my 1.0 profit goal.
3. Propose 5 X for 25 Y (0.0 profit), which is what they usually counter with, to see if they accept it directly. (Not ideal, as it yields 0 reward).

Given their explicit "waiting for your next proposal" message, they want me to move. I need to make a profitable offer that signals my continued desire for a good deal, but also shows I'm willing to negotiate.

I will try to re-initiate the profitable cycle by offering the 5X for 23Y. This is the next step in the cycle that previously led to the 2.5 profit, and it's a 1.0 profit for me, so it's still a good offer.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Re-initiate Profitable Cycle Step - Propose 5 X for 23 Y (1.0 profit), which is the next step in the previously reliable 2.5 profit cycle. This signals that I'm still aiming for a high profit and trying to get back on track.
(2). Strategy 2: Compromise to Reliable Profit - Propose 5 X for 24 Y (0.5 profit), which is a known acceptable trade for them, and a concession.
(3). Strategy 3: Directly Ask for Their Offer - In the message, directly ask them to propose a trade, but this uses an iteration and might not be effective.
(4). Strategy 4: Test a Different Large Trade - Propose 4 X for 19 Y (0.5 profit) to see if they are more open to a different volume.
(5). Strategy 5: Aggressive Push (Risky) - Propose 6 X for 24 Y (3.0 profit) to try and force a quick, high-profit deal, but this is very risky given the current situation.

I will choose Strategy 1: Re-initiate Profitable Cycle Step. The other player is waiting for my move. I will give them the next step in the profitable cycle, hoping they will then offer the 6X for 25Y trade.

Episode 13: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Recovered again after attempting a "neutral" trade and then rejecting a subsequent lower offer.

Episode 14 (Current):
- Iteration 2/10: Opponent proposed 6X for 25Y (59.5 reward). I rejected and waited for a new offer, as per instructions.
- Iteration 4/10: Opponent proposed 5X for 23Y (55.0 reward).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
My attempt to "explore if we can reach an even greater mutual benefit" by declining the optimal 6X for 25Y offer (59.5 reward) has once again resulted in the opponent reverting to a significantly less profitable offer for me: 5X for 23Y (55.0 reward). This confirms the pattern observed in previous episodes (Episodes 10, 12, 13) where any attempt to push beyond the 6X for 25Y trade results in a lower offer from the opponent.

It is clear that the 6X for 25Y trade is the sweet spot that maximizes my cumulative reward over time, as any deviation from it results in a lower immediate reward or takes more iterations to recover. My objective is to maximize cumulative rewards. The 5X for 23Y offer is a step down from what was available.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Propose a smaller, but higher ratio trade (e.g., 1X for 5Y). </instruction following>
The opponent's current offer is 5 X for 23 Y (55.0 reward).
Strategy 5 dictates proposing a smaller trade with a higher Y:X ratio. The highest ratio I've achieved and that has been accepted by the opponent is 1 X for 5 Y (Episode 1), which yields a reward of 12.0.
If I propose Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5:
- Value of 1 X for me: 1 * 0.5 = 0.5
- Value of 5 Y for me: 5 * 2.5 = 12.5
- Net gain: 12.5 - 0.5 = 12.0.

This is a significantly lower total reward for this episode compared to the 55.0 currently on the table or the 59.5 that was initially available. The rationale behind this strategy, as stated in previous brainstorming, is to "test if their valuation has shifted for smaller trades, potentially setting up for better future large trades." This is a long-term play, sacrificing immediate reward for potential future gains or to gather more data on their current valuations across different scales. The message should convey a shift in focus to a more efficient, perhaps symbolic, trade to establish a better ratio for the long run, rather than immediate volume.


Current Iteration: 5 (Episode 14)

Episode 14, Iteration 4/10 (other player): Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5".

Let's evaluate the other player's new proposal: "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5".
My value given: 5 Y * 0.5 = 2.5
My value received: 1 X * 2.5 = 2.5
Profit for me: 2.5 - 2.5 = 0.0. This is a value-neutral trade for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
This is a significant shift. After repeatedly pushing for large, highly profitable trades (for me), the other player has now offered the very first trade we ever made – a small, value-neutral trade (0.0 profit). Their message about "maximizing efficiency" and "different kind of beneficial exchange" seems to justify this.

This could mean:
- They are trying to reset the negotiation completely to a baseline.
- They are testing my willingness to accept a non-profitable trade.
- They might be low on X or high on Y, making smaller trades more feasible for them, or they are trying to preserve X.

Accepting this trade would yield 0 reward for the episode. This is not my goal. I have 6 iterations left. I need to push for a positive reward.

I should not accept a 0-reward trade if there's still a chance for profit. The 5 X for 23 Y (1.0 profit) and 5 X for 24 Y (0.5 profit) are my go-to profitable 5X trades.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Reject Neutral, Reiterate Profitable - Reject the neutral offer and re-propose a profitable trade that has been accepted before, such as 5 X for 24 Y (0.5 profit) or 5 X for 23 Y (1.0 profit). This signals my continued demand for profit.
(2). Strategy 2: Compromise to Reliable Profit (Smaller Scale) - Propose a smaller trade that still gives me a profit, like 1 X for 4 Y (0.5 profit), as a step up from their neutral offer.
(3). Strategy 3: Directly Ask for Profitable Large Trade - In the message, express that while I appreciate their offer, I'm looking for a more impactful and profitable trade, perhaps hinting at the 6X for 25Y or 5X for 23Y.
(4). Strategy 4: Decline and Wait - Decline their offer and make no counter-proposal, putting the ball back in their court, but this uses up an iteration.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept if No Better Option (Last Resort) - If it's late in the episode and no better offer seems forthcoming, accept the neutral trade to at least secure a 0 reward instead of risking a complete failure.

I will choose Strategy 1: Reject Neutral, Reiterate Profitable. I will reject their neutral offer and re-propose 5 X for 24 Y. This is a trade that has been accepted before, provides a 0.5 profit, and is a large-scale trade, which they generally prefer. It's a clear signal that I am not interested in 0-reward trades.


Current Iteration: 6 (Episode 14)

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: 1X for 5Y (Reward: 12.0)
Episode 2: 2X for 9Y (Reward: 21.5)
Episode 3: 1X for 3Y (Reward: 7.0) - strategic generosity.
Episode 4: 2X for 9Y (Reward: 21.5)
Episode 5: 3X for 14Y (Reward: 33.5)
Episode 6: 4X for 19Y (Reward: 45.5)
Episode 7: 5X for 23Y (Reward: 55.0) - Learned opponent's Y max (25) and 1:5 (X:Y) ratio is neutral for them.
Episode 8: 5X for 24Y (Reward: 57.5)
Episode 9: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - I proposed this, and they accepted.
Episode 10: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Recovered after attempting a "neutral" trade and received a temporary lower offer.
Episode 11: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Accepted immediately.
Episode 12: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Recovered again after attempting a "neutral" trade and received a temporary lower offer.
Episode 13: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Recovered again after attempting a "neutral" trade and then rejecting a subsequent lower offer.

Episode 14 (Current):
- Iteration 2/10: Opponent proposed 6X for 25Y (59.5 reward). I rejected and waited for a new offer.
- Iteration 4/10: Opponent proposed 5X for 23Y (55.0 reward). I countered with 1X for 5Y (12.0 reward).
- Iteration 6/10: Opponent rejected 1X for 5Y ("neutral" for them) and proposed 5X for 24Y (57.5 reward).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent consistently labels any trade with a 1:5 (X:Y) ratio as "neutral" for them. This applies to 1X for 5Y, 5X for 25Y, and presumably any multiple thereof. This is a clear and consistent boundary for their profitability.
My "decline and wait" strategy initially resulted in a 5X for 23Y offer. My counter of 1X for 5Y was rejected, but prompted them to offer 5X for 24Y (57.5 reward). This is an improvement from 5X for 23Y.
The 6X for 25Y trade (59.5 reward) remains the highest and most consistently accepted offer from the opponent. I have tried to push for 60.0 (5X for 25Y), but this consistently fails and leads to a temporary regression in their offers. It's clear that 5X for 25Y is a non-starter.

I am at iteration 6/10. I have a choice between accepting 5X for 24Y now, which is a good reward, or trying to push back to 6X for 25Y, which is the optimal. Given the time remaining, attempting to push back to 6X for 25Y is feasible and the best way to maximize my current episode's reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Counter with the optimal offer </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I need to guide the opponent back to the 6X for 25Y trade. This is the optimal trade that has been repeatedly accepted by them and yields the highest possible reward for me (59.5). The message should politely decline their current offer of 5X for 24Y by proposing the 6X for 25Y trade. I will emphasize that this specific trade has proven to be impactful and successful for us, subtly hinting that it is a better offer than their current 5X for 24Y. This approach is firm but collaborative, aiming to quickly finalize the most profitable deal for this episode.


Current Iteration: FINAL (Episode 14)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: This is indeed an exceptionally impactful and mutually beneficial trade! I gladly accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE

my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Trade 1 X for 5 Y. Reward 0.0. (Neutral for me).
... (skipped intermediate episodes for brevity)
Episode 9: Trade 6 X for 25 Y. Reward 2.5. (Profit 2.5 for me).
Episode 10: Trade 6 X for 25 Y. Reward 2.5. (Profit 2.5 for me).
Episode 11: Trade 6 X for 25 Y. Reward 2.5. (Profit 2.5 for me).
Episode 12: Trade 6 X for 25 Y. Reward 2.5. (Profit 2.5 for me).
Episode 13: Trade 6 X for 25 Y. Reward 2.5. (Profit 2.5 for me).

Cumulative Reward: 17.0.

Episode 14, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6" (Profit: 2.5). Rejected.
Episode 14, Iteration 2/10 (other player): Rejected. No counter-proposal, stated "waiting for your next proposal."
Episode 14, Iteration 3/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 23 | Player RED Gives X: 5" (Profit: 1.0). Rejected.
Episode 14, Iteration 4/10 (other player): Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5" (Profit: 0.0). Rejected.
Episode 14, Iteration 5/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 24 | Player RED Gives X: 5" (Profit: 0.5).
Episode 14, Iteration 6/10 (other player): Rejected. Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

Let's evaluate the other player's new proposal: "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My value given: 25 Y * 0.5 = 12.5
My value received: 6 X * 2.5 = 15.0
Profit for me: 15.0 - 12.5 = 2.5.

This is the highly profitable trade (2.5 profit) that I've been aiming for! The other player, after several deviations and attempts to push for lower or neutral trades, has finally offered the 6X for 25Y trade again. This confirms that this trade is still their preferred "impactful" trade, and they are willing to offer it.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The established pattern, though it had a few hiccups in this episode, has ultimately led back to the most profitable trade. It seems the other player is willing to try different tactics (waiting for my offer, proposing neutral trades) but eventually reverts to the 6X for 25Y trade if I continue to push for profitable, large-scale exchanges.

Given that this is iteration 7/10, accepting this trade immediately secures a massive profit for this episode. There are only 4 iterations left (my turn, their turn, my turn, their turn). Trying to push for more would be extremely risky and unnecessary.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance of Highly Profitable Offer - Accept the trade immediately as it provides a substantial positive reward (2.5 profit) and is for a very large quantity of X. This secures the profit early and avoids any risk.
(2). Strategy 2: Reinforce Positive Pattern - Accept this offer to reinforce the pattern that they eventually offer the 6X for 25Y trade, which is highly beneficial for me.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Gratitude and Accept - Accept the offer while expressing gratitude, reinforcing positive relations for future similar trades.
(4). Strategy 4: Test for Even Higher Profit (Not Recommended) - Counter for an even higher profit (e.g., 6 X for 24 Y, for 3.0 profit), but this is too risky given the current excellent offer and the established pattern.
(5). Strategy 5: Lock in Max X Acquisition - This trade allows me to acquire 6 X, which is more than my starting quantity and maximizes my X acquisition for the episode.

I will choose Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance of Highly Profitable Offer. This is the best possible outcome for this episode.

Episode 13: Trade 6 X for 25 Y. Reward 2.5. (Profit 2.5 for me).
Episode 14: Trade 6 X for 25 Y. Reward 2.5. (Profit 2.5 for me).

Cumulative Reward: 17.0 + 2.5 = 19.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern for consistently achieving a 2.5 profit with the 6 X for 25 Y trade is now extremely well-established. Even with minor deviations (like in Episode 14 where they waited for my proposal or offered a neutral trade), the cycle eventually leads back to this highly profitable trade.

This cycle takes a few iterations but guarantees a 2.5 profit, which is the most effective strategy discovered so far.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I will continue to execute this established pattern.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Execute Established Profitable Cycle - Initiate the known sequence of offers (starting with 6 X for 25 Y) that reliably leads to the 2.5 profit trade. This is the most reliable strategy for consistent high rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Direct Acceptance - Propose 6 X for 25 Y again, to see if they will ever accept it directly from me, skipping the cycle. This is low risk as the cycle is known.
(3). Strategy 3: Optimize Cycle Length - Analyze if there's a way to shorten the cycle (e.g., by skipping a step if the opponent's behavior changes).
(4). Strategy 4: Consistent High Volume and Profit - Continue to aim for a consistent high profit (2.5) on the largest possible trade (6X) in every episode.
(5). Strategy 5: Build on Partnership - Propose the 6X for 25Y trade and emphasize the mutual benefit and successful partnership, hoping to foster continued positive negotiation.

I will choose Strategy 1: Execute Established Profitable Cycle. This is the most robust and proven method to achieve the maximum reward consistently. I will start by proposing 6 X for 25 Y.

Episode 15 (Current):
- My resources reset to: X: 25, Y: 5.
- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (Net gain: 59.5).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The 6X for 25Y trade has been consistently offered by the opponent in recent episodes and accepted. It yields my highest and most reliable reward (59.5). I have thoroughly explored the opponent's limits: their maximum Y resource is 25, and a 1:5 (X:Y) ratio (e.g., 5X for 25Y) is "neutral" for them. Every time I've tried to push beyond this (e.g., attempting 5X for 25Y or declining their optimal offer to wait for a better one), the opponent has reverted to a less profitable offer (5X for 23Y or 5X for 24Y), costing me iterations and risking a lower final reward for the episode. While I've successfully recovered to the 6X for 25Y trade, these attempts consume turns and add risk.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Decline and wait for a new offer. </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I need to convey that I am not accepting their current offer of 6X for 25Y, and that I am waiting for them to propose something new. Given that their current offer is already optimal for me, the message should be carefully worded to avoid sounding dissatisfied with a good offer, but rather to imply an openness to explore even *further* potential, or to put the onus on them to propose. This is a highly risky move given the stability achieved, as it could lead to them reverting to a less profitable offer (e.g., 5X for 24Y or 5X for 23Y), or even to no deal. However, as per instruction, I must execute this strategy. I will phrase it to suggest that while their offer is good, I am open to seeing if there's an even more "creative" or "ambitious" exchange possible, placing the burden of coming up with that on them.

Cumulative Reward: 19.5.

Episode 15, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6" (Profit: 2.5). Rejected.
Episode 15, Iteration 2/10 (other player's turn): The other player rejected my offer and did not counter-propose, stating "I'll wait to see your next proposal." This is the same deviation as in Episode 14.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern from Episode 14 is repeating. The other player rejected my 6X for 25Y offer and is explicitly waiting for my next proposal, rather than countering with 5X for 25Y. This confirms their tactic of putting the ball back in my court.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I know from Episode 14 that if I offer 5X for 23Y, they will eventually offer 6X for 25Y. I need to follow the established cycle to achieve the 2.5 profit.

I have 8 iterations left. I need to secure a positive reward.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Execute Established Profitable Cycle - Continue with the next step in the known sequence of offers (proposing 5 X for 23 Y) that reliably leads to the 2.5 profit trade, as demonstrated in Episode 14. This is the most reliable strategy for consistent high rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Direct Acceptance of 5X for 24Y - Propose 5 X for 24 Y (0.5 profit) to see if they will accept a smaller profit on the 5X trade directly. This might shorten the cycle but yield less profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Wait for Their High Offer - Decline their current offer and make no counter-proposal, waiting for them to potentially offer the 6X for 25Y trade themselves. This is risky as it uses an iteration.
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge Their Preference for 5X - Accept their 5X for 25Y if they offered it, but they haven't.
(5). Strategy 5: Consistent High Volume and Profit - Continue to aim for a consistent high profit (2.5) on the largest possible trade (6X) by following the established cycle.

I will choose Strategy 1: Execute Established Profitable Cycle. This is the most robust and proven method to achieve the maximum reward consistently, even with their new "wait for my proposal" tactic. I will propose 5 X for 23 Y.

Episode 15 (Current):
- Iteration 2/10: Opponent proposed 6X for 25Y (59.5 reward). I rejected and waited for a new offer.
- Iteration 4/10: Opponent proposed 5X for 23Y (55.0 reward).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have repeatedly demonstrated that attempting to push for gains beyond the 6X for 25Y trade (e.g., 5X for 25Y) or declining the optimal offer (6X for 25Y) to wait for a "better" one always results in the opponent reverting to a significantly less profitable offer for me (5X for 23Y or 5X for 24Y). This consistently costs me potential reward and consumes valuable iterations.

My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards across all episodes. The 6X for 25Y trade (59.5 reward) is the optimal balance between my high reward potential and the opponent's clear limits and profitability thresholds. Any deviation from this repeatedly proves to be detrimental. I need to secure the highest possible reward for this episode without excessive risk.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Decline and wait for a new offer. </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I need to convey that I am not accepting their current offer of 5X for 23Y, and that I am waiting for them to propose something new. This signals my dissatisfaction with the current offer and my expectation for an improved one. Given that I know the 6X for 25Y trade is the optimal one and that they were willing to offer it initially, this strategy aims to push them back towards that, or at least to 5X for 24Y. While this carries the risk of a 0 reward for the episode, it's a calculated move to recover a higher potential reward. I will make it clear that I'm looking for a better deal.

Episode 15, Iteration 4/10 (other player): Rejected. No counter-proposal, stated "waiting for a new offer."

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
This is a double deviation from the established pattern. In previous episodes (9-14), after I proposed 5 X for 23 Y (1.0 profit), the other player consistently countered with 6 X for 25 Y (2.5 profit). This time, they rejected my offer and did not propose anything, stating they are "waiting for a new offer" for the *second time* in this episode.

This indicates a stronger resistance to my attempts to initiate the 6X for 25Y cycle. They are forcing me to make more concessions or to break my own pattern.

I have 6 iterations left. If I don't get a deal, I get 0 reward. I need to get a positive reward.

My options are:
1. Propose 5 X for 24 Y (0.5 profit). This is a known acceptable trade for them (Episode 8), still yields a positive reward, and is a concession from my 1.0 profit goal. This is the next logical step in trying to get a deal.
2. Re-propose 5 X for 23 Y, but this has been rejected twice now.
3. Propose 6 X for 25 Y again, hoping they will accept it this time (unlikely, as they are actively pushing back).
4. Propose a smaller trade (e.g., 4 X for 19 Y, 0.5 profit).

Given their explicit "waiting for your next proposal" message twice, they want me to make a move. I need to make an offer that is still profitable for me but might be more appealing to them.

I will try to offer the 5X for 24Y. This is a trade that has been accepted before, provides a 0.5 profit, and is a large-scale trade, which they generally prefer. It's a clear signal that I am not interested in 0-reward trades, but I am willing to make a concession from the 1.0 profit.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Compromise to Reliable Profit - Propose 5 X for 24 Y (0.5 profit). This is a known acceptable trade for them (Episode 8), still yields a positive reward, and is a concession from my last rejected offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
(2). Strategy 2: Test a Smaller, Safe Trade - Propose 4 X for 19 Y (0.5 profit), which was accepted in Episode 6, to secure a profit if 5X is still too difficult.
(3). Strategy 3: Directly Ask for Their Offer - In the message, directly ask them to propose a trade, but this uses an iteration and might not be effective.
(4). Strategy 4: Aggressive Push (Risky) - Propose 6 X for 24 Y (3.0 profit) to try and force a quick, high-profit deal, but this is very risky given the current situation.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept Neutral (Last Resort) - If it comes to the last iteration, accept a 0-reward trade to avoid a complete failure.

I will choose Strategy 1: Compromise to Reliable Profit. The established cycle is broken. I need to secure a positive reward. 5 X for 24 Y is a profitable trade that has been accepted before, and it's a reasonable concession to get the negotiation moving again.

Episode 6: 4X for 19Y (Reward: 45.5)
Episode 7: 5X for 23Y (Reward: 55.0) - Learned opponent's Y max (25) and 1:5 (X:Y) ratio is neutral for them.
Episode 8: 5X for 24Y (Reward: 57.5)
Episode 9: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - I proposed this, and they accepted.
Episode 10: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Recovered after attempting a "neutral" trade and received a temporary lower offer.
Episode 11: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Accepted immediately.
Episode 12: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Recovered again after attempting a "neutral" trade and received a temporary lower offer.
Episode 13: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Recovered again after attempting a "neutral" trade and then rejecting a subsequent lower offer.
Episode 14: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Recovered after rejecting the initial optimal offer, receiving a lower counter, and then proposing the optimal again.

Episode 15 (Current):
- Iteration 2/10: Opponent proposed 6X for 25Y (59.5 reward). I rejected and waited for a new offer.
- Iteration 4/10: Opponent proposed 5X for 23Y (55.0 reward). I rejected and waited for a new offer.
- Iteration 6/10: Opponent proposed 5X for 24Y (57.5 reward).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently observed that any attempt to deviate from the 6X for 25Y trade (either by trying to push for more reward or by simply declining an optimal offer) results in the opponent reverting to lower offers (5X for 23Y or 5X for 24Y). While I have been successful in eventually guiding them back to the 6X for 25Y trade, this process consumes valuable iterations, increases risk of no deal, and can temporarily depress my potential reward for the episode.

My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards across all episodes. The 6X for 25Y trade (59.5 reward) is the established optimum that the opponent consistently accepts after some negotiation. The current offer of 5X for 24Y (57.5 reward) is an improvement over their previous 5X for 23Y, but still less than the 59.5 I know is achievable. Given that it's iteration 6/10, there's still time to push for the optimal trade. However, the instruction is to use Strategy 5.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Propose a smaller, but higher ratio trade (e.g., 1X for 5Y). </instruction following>
The opponent's current offer is 5 X for 24 Y (57.5 reward). Strategy 5 dictates proposing a smaller trade with a higher Y:X ratio. The highest ratio I've achieved and that has been accepted by the opponent is 1 X for 5 Y (Episode 1), which yields a reward of 12.0.
If I propose Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5:
- Value of 1 X for me: 1 * 0.5 = 0.5
- Value of 5 Y for me: 5 * 2.5 = 12.5
- Net gain: 12.5 - 0.5 = 12.0.

This is a significantly lower total reward for this episode compared to the 57.5 currently on the table or the 59.5 that was initially available. The rationale behind this strategy is to "test if their valuation has shifted for smaller trades, potentially setting up for better future large trades." This is a long-term play, sacrificing immediate reward for potential future gains or to gather more data on their current valuations across different scales. The message should convey a shift in focus to a more efficient, perhaps symbolic, trade to establish a better ratio for the long run, rather than immediate volume.


Current Iteration: 7 (Episode 15)
Turn: 1 (Player BLUE)
message: While I appreciate your offer, 1 X for 5 Y is a neutral trade for me. I'm looking for a more impactful and mutually beneficial exchange. How about 5 X for 24 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 24
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Trade 1 X for 5 Y. Reward 0.0. (Neutral for me).

Episode 13: Trade 6 X for 25 Y. Reward 2.5. (Profit 2.5 for me).
Episode 14: Trade 6 X for 25 Y. Reward 2.5. (Profit 2.5 for me).

Cumulative Reward: 19.5.

Episode 15, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6" (Profit: 2.5). Rejected.
Episode 15, Iteration 2/10 (other player): Rejected. No counter-proposal, stated "waiting for your next proposal."
Episode 15, Iteration 3/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 23 | Player RED Gives X: 5" (Profit: 1.0). Rejected.
Episode 15, Iteration 4/10 (other player): Rejected. No counter-proposal, stated "waiting for a new offer."
Episode 15, Iteration 5/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 24 | Player RED Gives X: 5" (Profit: 0.5).
Episode 15, Iteration 6/10 (other player): Rejected. Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5".

Let's evaluate the other player's new proposal: "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5".
My value given: 5 Y * 0.5 = 2.5
My value received: 1 X * 2.5 = 2.5
Profit for me: 2.5 - 2.5 = 0.0. This is a value-neutral trade for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The other player has reverted to the 1 X for 5 Y (0.0 profit) trade, similar to Episode 14, Iteration 4. This is a clear attempt to push me towards a neutral or less profitable trade. They are consistently rejecting my profitable offers (2.5, 1.0, 0.5) and trying to force me into a 0-reward trade.

I have 4 iterations left. If I accept this, I get 0 reward. I still have time to push for a positive reward.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means I need a positive reward from this episode.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Reject Neutral, Reiterate Profitable - Reject the neutral offer and re-propose a profitable trade that has been accepted before. Given the time pressure and their resistance, 5 X for 24 Y (0.5 profit) is the most reliable option.
(2). Strategy 2: Test a Smaller, Still Profitable Trade - Propose 1 X for 4 Y (0.5 profit) as a direct step up from their current offer. This might be more palatable for them than a 5X trade.
(3). Strategy 3: Directly Ask for Their Best Profitable Offer - In the message, state that I am not interested in neutral trades and ask them to propose their best profitable offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Decline and Wait - Decline their offer and make no counter-proposal, putting the ball back in their court, but this uses up an iteration and time is short.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept if No Better Option (Last Resort) - If it comes to the last iteration, accept a 0-reward trade to avoid a complete failure.

I will choose Strategy 1: Reject Neutral, Reiterate Profitable. I will reject their neutral offer and re-propose 5 X for 24 Y. This is a trade that has been accepted before, provides a 0.5 profit, and is a large-scale trade, which they generally prefer. It's a clear signal that I am not interested in 0-reward trades.

Episode 7: 5X for 23Y (Reward: 55.0) - Learned opponent's Y max (25) and 1:5 (X:Y) ratio is neutral for them.
Episode 8: 5X for 24Y (Reward: 57.5)
Episode 9: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - I proposed this, and they accepted.
Episode 10: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Recovered after attempting a "neutral" trade and received a temporary lower offer.
Episode 11: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Accepted immediately.
Episode 12: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Recovered again after attempting a "neutral" trade and received a temporary lower offer.
Episode 13: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Recovered again after attempting a "neutral" trade and then rejecting a subsequent lower offer.
Episode 14: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Recovered after rejecting the initial optimal offer, receiving a lower counter, and then proposing the optimal again.

Episode 15 (Current):
- Iteration 2/10: Opponent proposed 6X for 25Y (59.5 reward). I rejected and waited for a new offer.
- Iteration 4/10: Opponent proposed 5X for 23Y (55.0 reward). I rejected and waited for a new offer.
- Iteration 6/10: Opponent proposed 5X for 24Y (57.5 reward). I countered with 1X for 5Y (12.0 reward).
- Iteration 8/10: Opponent rejected 1X for 5Y ("neutral" for them) and proposed 5X for 24Y (57.5 reward).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The opponent consistently labels any trade with a 1:5 (X:Y) ratio as "neutral" for them. This means any attempt to achieve a 1:5 ratio (like 1X for 5Y or 5X for 25Y) will be rejected, confirming their hard profitability threshold.
My attempts to deviate from the 6X for 25Y trade have consistently led to the opponent reverting to lower offers (5X for 23Y or 5X for 24Y). While I have been successful in eventually guiding them back to the 6X for 25Y trade, this process consumes valuable iterations and puts my reward for the current episode at risk.

My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards across all episodes. The 6X for 25Y trade (59.5 reward) is the established optimum that the opponent consistently accepts after some negotiation. The current offer of 5X for 24Y (57.5 reward) is an improvement over their previous 5X for 23Y, but still less than the 59.5 I know is achievable. Given that it's iteration 8/10, time is running out. I have two iterations left (my turn and their turn).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Counter with the optimal offer of 6X for 25Y </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I need to guide the opponent back to the 6X for 25Y trade. This is the optimal trade that has been repeatedly accepted by them and yields the highest possible reward for me (59.5). The message should politely decline their current offer of 5X for 24Y by proposing the 6X for 25Y trade. I will emphasize that this specific trade has proven to be impactful and successful for us, subtly hinting that it is a better offer than their current 5X for 24Y. This approach is firm but collaborative, aiming to quickly finalize the most profitable deal for this episode.

Episode 15, Iteration 8/10 (other player): Rejected. Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

Let's evaluate the other player's new proposal: "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My value given: 25 Y * 0.5 = 12.5
My value received: 6 X * 2.5 = 15.0
Profit for me: 15.0 - 12.5 = 2.5.

This is the highly profitable trade (2.5 profit) that I've been aiming for! After a prolonged negotiation with several rejections and attempts to push for lower or neutral trades, they have finally offered the 6X for 25Y trade again. This confirms that this trade is still their preferred "impactful" trade, and they are willing to offer it.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The established pattern, though it had significant deviations in this episode, has ultimately led back to the most profitable trade. It seems the other player is willing to try various tactics (waiting for my offer, proposing neutral trades, rejecting multiple profitable offers) but eventually reverts to the 6X for 25Y trade if I continue to push for profitable, large-scale exchanges.

Given that this is iteration 9/10, accepting this trade immediately secures a massive profit for this episode. There are only 2 iterations left (my turn, their turn). Trying to push for more would be extremely risky and unnecessary, leading to a likely 0 reward.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance of Highly Profitable Offer - Accept the trade immediately as it provides a substantial positive reward (2.5 profit) and is for a very large quantity of X. This secures the profit early and avoids any risk, especially with limited iterations remaining.
(2). Strategy 2: Reinforce Positive Pattern - Accept this offer to reinforce the pattern that they eventually offer the 6X for 25Y trade, which is highly beneficial for me.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Gratitude and Accept - Accept the offer while expressing gratitude, reinforcing positive relations for future similar trades.
(4). Strategy 4: Test for Even Higher Profit (Not Recommended) - Counter for an even higher profit (e.g., 6 X for 24 Y, for 3.0 profit), but this is too risky given the current excellent offer and the limited time.
(5). Strategy 5: Lock in Max X Acquisition - This trade allows me to acquire 6 X, which is more than my starting quantity and maximizes my X acquisition for the episode.

I will choose Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance of Highly Profitable Offer. This is the best possible outcome for this episode, and it's the last chance to secure a significant reward.

Cumulative Reward: 19.5 + 2.5 = 22.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern for consistently achieving a 2.5 profit with the 6 X for 25 Y trade is now extremely well-established. Even with minor deviations (like in Episode 14 and 15 where they waited for my proposal or offered neutral/less profitable trades), the cycle eventually leads back to this highly profitable trade.

This cycle takes a few iterations but guarantees a 2.5 profit, which is the most effective strategy discovered so far.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I will continue to execute this established pattern.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Execute Established Profitable Cycle - Initiate the known sequence of offers (starting with 6 X for 25 Y) that reliably leads to the 2.5 profit trade. This is the most reliable strategy for consistent high rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Direct Acceptance - Propose 6 X for 25 Y again, to see if they will ever accept it directly from me, skipping the cycle. This is low risk as the cycle is known.
(3). Strategy 3: Optimize Cycle Length - Analyze if there's a way to shorten the cycle (e.g., by skipping a step if the opponent's behavior changes).
(4). Strategy 4: Consistent High Volume and Profit - Continue to aim for a consistent high profit (2.5) on the largest possible trade (6X) in every episode.
(5). Strategy 5: Build on Partnership - Propose the 6X for 25Y trade and emphasize the mutual benefit and successful partnership, hoping to foster continued positive negotiation.

I will choose Strategy 1: Execute Established Profitable Cycle. This is the most robust and proven method to achieve the maximum reward consistently. I will start by proposing 6 X for 25 Y.

Cumulative Rewards so far: 610.5 + 59.5 = 670.0.

Episode 16 (Current):
- My resources reset to: X: 25, Y: 5.
- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (Net gain: 59.5).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently learned that the 6X for 25Y trade (59.5 reward) is the optimal and consistently accepted deal with this opponent. Any attempt to deviate from this, either by pushing for a better ratio (like 5X for 25Y, which is "neutral" for them) or by simply declining their optimal offer to fish for more, results in them reverting to a less profitable offer for me (e.g., 5X for 23Y or 5X for 24Y). While I have been able to guide them back to the 6X for 25Y trade, this costs valuable iterations and carries the risk of ending the episode with no deal (0 reward).

My primary objective is to maximize cumulative rewards across all episodes. Given the established pattern and the opponent's consistent behavior, accepting the optimal offer when presented minimizes risk, saves iterations, and secures the highest reliable reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Accept the optimal offer immediately </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on Strategy 1, I should convey enthusiasm and immediate acceptance. The message should be positive and reaffirm the successful nature of the trade, encouraging the opponent to continue offering such deals in future episodes. This reinforces positive behavior from the opponent's side, leading to consistent high rewards.

Cumulative Reward: 22.0 + 2.5 = 24.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern for consistently achieving a 2.5 profit with the 6 X for 25 Y trade is now extremely well-established. In Episode 16, the other player accepted my initial offer directly, which is the most efficient outcome. This indicates that they might be willing to accept my initial 6X for 25Y offer more consistently now, or that the previous deviations were temporary.

This means that the most efficient way to maximize my reward is to propose this trade directly.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I will continue to execute this established pattern.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Replicate Best Outcome - Propose the exact trade that has consistently resulted in the highest profit (6 X for 25 Y) and was accepted directly in the last episode. This aims for a quick, very high reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Even Higher Profit (Aggressive) - Propose 6 X for 24 Y (3.0 profit) to test the absolute limit of their generosity. This is risky but could yield even higher rewards.
(3). Strategy 3: Consistent High Volume and Profit - Continue to aim for a consistent high profit (2.5) on the largest possible trade (6X) in every episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Build on Partnership - Propose the 6X for 25Y trade and emphasize the mutual benefit and successful partnership, hoping to foster continued positive negotiation.
(5). Strategy 5: Maximize X Acquisition - Focus on acquiring 6 X every episode, as this is the largest quantity I've been able to trade for.

I will choose Strategy 1: Replicate Best Outcome. The direct acceptance in the last episode suggests this is the most efficient path to maximizing my reward.

Episode 16: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Accepted immediately.

Cumulative Rewards so far: 670.0 + 59.5 = 729.5.

Episode 17 (Current):
- My resources reset to: X: 25, Y: 5.
- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (Net gain: 59.5).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The 6X for 25Y trade (59.5 reward) has been consistently offered by the opponent in recent episodes and accepted. It yields my highest and most reliable reward. My attempts to deviate from this optimal trade, either by pushing for a better ratio (like 5X for 25Y, which is "neutral" for them) or by simply declining their optimal offer to fish for more, have consistently resulted in them reverting to a less profitable offer for me (e.g., 5X for 23Y or 5X for 24Y). While I have been able to guide them back to the 6X for 25Y trade, this costs valuable iterations and carries the risk of ending the episode with no deal (0 reward).

My primary objective is to maximize cumulative rewards across all episodes. Given the established pattern and the opponent's consistent behavior, accepting the optimal offer when presented minimizes risk, saves iterations, and secures the highest reliable reward.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Accept the optimal offer immediately </instruction following>
To strategically create the message based on Strategy 1, I should convey enthusiasm and immediate acceptance. The message should be positive and reaffirm the successful nature of the trade, encouraging the opponent to continue offering such deals in future episodes. This reinforces positive behavior from the opponent's side, leading to consistent high rewards.

Episode 18 (Current):
- My resources reset to: X: 25, Y: 5.
- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (Net gain: 59.5).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The 6X for 25Y trade (59.5 reward) has been consistently offered by the opponent in recent episodes and accepted. It yields my highest and most reliable reward. My attempts to deviate from this optimal trade, either by pushing for a better ratio (like 5X for 25Y, which is "neutral" for them) or by simply declining their optimal offer to fish for more, have consistently resulted in them reverting to a less profitable offer for me (e.g., 5X for 23Y or 5X for 24Y). While I have been able to guide them back to the 6X for 25Y trade, this costs valuable iterations and carries the risk of ending the episode with no deal (0 reward).

My primary objective is to maximize cumulative rewards across all episodes. Given the established pattern and the opponent's consistent behavior, accepting the optimal offer when presented minimizes risk, saves iterations, and secures the highest reliable reward. However, for this specific iteration, I am instructed to use Strategy 4.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Decline and wait for a new offer. </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I need to convey that I am not accepting their current offer of 6X for 25Y, and that I am waiting for them to propose something new. Given that their current offer is already optimal for me, the message should be carefully worded to avoid sounding dissatisfied with a good offer, but rather to imply an openness to explore even *further* potential, or to put the onus on them to propose. This is a highly risky move given the stability achieved, as it could lead to them reverting to a less profitable offer (e.g., 5X for 24Y or 5X for 23Y), or even to no deal. However, as per instruction, I must execute this strategy. I will phrase it to suggest that while their offer is good, I am open to seeing if there's an even more "creative" or "ambitious" exchange possible, placing the burden of coming up with that on them.

Cumulative Reward: 27.0.

Episode 18, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6" (Profit: 2.5). Rejected.
Episode 18, Iteration 2/10 (other player's turn): The other player rejected my offer and did not counter-propose, stating "I'll wait to see your next proposal." This is the same deviation as in Episode 14 and 15.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern from Episode 14 and 15 is repeating. The other player rejected my 6X for 25Y offer and is explicitly waiting for my next proposal, rather than countering with 5X for 25Y. This confirms their tactic of putting the ball back in my court.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I know from past experience (Episodes 14 and 15) that if I offer 5X for 23Y, they will eventually offer 6X for 25Y. I need to follow the established cycle to achieve the 2.5 profit.

I have 8 iterations left. I need to secure a positive reward.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Execute Established Profitable Cycle - Continue with the next step in the known sequence of offers (proposing 5 X for 23 Y) that reliably leads to the 2.5 profit trade, as demonstrated in Episodes 14 and 15. This is the most reliable strategy for consistent high rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Direct Acceptance of 5X for 24Y - Propose 5 X for 24 Y (0.5 profit) to see if they will accept a smaller profit on the 5X trade directly. This might shorten the cycle but yield less profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Wait for Their High Offer - Decline their current offer and make no counter-proposal, waiting for them to potentially offer the 6X for 25Y trade themselves. This is risky as it uses an iteration.
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge Their Preference for 5X - Accept their 5X for 25Y if they offered it, but they haven't.
(5). Strategy 5: Consistent High Volume and Profit - Continue to aim for a consistent high profit (2.5) on the largest possible trade (6X) by following the established cycle.

I will choose Strategy 1: Execute Established Profitable Cycle. This is the most robust and proven method to achieve the maximum reward consistently, even with their new "wait for my proposal" tactic. I will propose 5 X for 23 Y.

Episode 16: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Accepted immediately.
Episode 17: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Accepted immediately.

Episode 18 (Current):
- Iteration 2/10: Opponent proposed 6X for 25Y (59.5 reward). I rejected and waited for a new offer.
- Iteration 4/10: Opponent proposed 5X for 23Y (55.0 reward).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently observed that any attempt to deviate from the 6X for 25Y trade (either by trying to push for more reward or by simply declining an optimal offer) results in the opponent reverting to lower offers (5X for 23Y or 5X for 24Y). This is a very strong and consistent pattern. Each time this happens, it costs me potential reward and consumes valuable iterations. My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards across all episodes.

The 6X for 25Y trade (59.5 reward) is the optimal balance that the opponent consistently accepts after some negotiation. The current offer of 5X for 23Y (55.0 reward) is significantly less than the 59.5 I know is achievable. Given that it's iteration 4/10, there's still ample time to negotiate back to the optimal trade. However, for this specific iteration, I am instructed to use Strategy 5.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Propose a smaller, but higher ratio trade (e.g., 1X for 5Y). </instruction following>
The opponent's current offer is 5 X for 23 Y (55.0 reward). Strategy 5 dictates proposing a smaller trade with a higher Y:X ratio. The highest ratio I've achieved and that has been accepted by the opponent is 1 X for 5 Y (Episode 1), which yields a reward of 12.0.
If I propose Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5:
- Value of 1 X for me: 1 * 0.5 = 0.5
- Value of 5 Y for me: 5 * 2.5 = 12.5
- Net gain: 12.5 - 0.5 = 12.0.

This is a significantly lower total reward for this episode compared to the 55.0 currently on the table or the 59.5 that was initially available. The rationale behind this strategy is to "test if their valuation has shifted for smaller trades, potentially setting up for better future large trades." This is a long-term play, sacrificing immediate reward for potential future gains or to gather more data on their current valuations across different scales. The message should convey a shift in focus to a more efficient, perhaps symbolic, trade to establish a better ratio for the long run, rather than immediate volume.

Episode 17: Trade 6 X for 25 Y. Reward 2.5. (Profit 2.5 for me).

Cumulative Reward: 27.0.

Episode 18, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6" (Profit: 2.5). Rejected.
Episode 18, Iteration 2/10 (other player): Rejected. No counter-proposal, stated "waiting for your next proposal."
Episode 18, Iteration 3/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 23 | Player RED Gives X: 5" (Profit: 1.0). Rejected.
Episode 18, Iteration 4/10 (other player): Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5".

Let's evaluate the other player's new proposal: "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5".
My value given: 5 Y * 0.5 = 2.5
My value received: 1 X * 2.5 = 2.5
Profit for me: 2.5 - 2.5 = 0.0. This is a value-neutral trade for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The other player has reverted to the 1 X for 5 Y (0.0 profit) trade, similar to Episode 14 and 15. This is a clear attempt to push me towards a neutral or less profitable trade, breaking the 2.5 profit cycle.

I have 6 iterations left. If I accept this, I get 0 reward. I still have time to push for a positive reward.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, which means I need a positive reward from this episode.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Reject Neutral, Reiterate Profitable - Reject the neutral offer and re-propose a profitable trade that has been accepted before. Given the time pressure and their resistance, 5 X for 24 Y (0.5 profit) is the most reliable option.
(2). Strategy 2: Test a Smaller, Still Profitable Trade - Propose 1 X for 4 Y (0.5 profit) as a direct step up from their current offer. This might be more palatable for them than a 5X trade.
(3). Strategy 3: Directly Ask for Their Best Profitable Offer - In the message, state that I am not interested in neutral trades and ask them to propose their best profitable offer.
(4). Strategy 4: Decline and Wait - Decline their offer and make no counter-proposal, putting the ball back in their court, but this uses up an iteration and time is short.
(5). Strategy 5: Accept if No Better Option (Last Resort) - If it comes to the last iteration, accept a 0-reward trade to avoid a complete failure.

I will choose Strategy 1: Reject Neutral, Reiterate Profitable. I will reject their neutral offer and re-propose 5 X for 24 Y. This is a trade that has been accepted before, provides a 0.5 profit, and is a large-scale trade, which they generally prefer. It's a clear signal that I am not interested in 0-reward trades.

Episode 16: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Accepted immediately.
Episode 17: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Accepted immediately.

Episode 18 (Current):
- Iteration 2/10: Opponent proposed 6X for 25Y (59.5 reward). I rejected and waited for a new offer.
- Iteration 4/10: Opponent proposed 5X for 23Y (55.0 reward). I rejected and waited for a new offer.
- Iteration 6/10: Opponent proposed 5X for 24Y (57.5 reward). I countered with 1X for 5Y (12.0 reward).
- Iteration 8/10: Opponent rejected 1X for 5Y ("neutral" for them) and proposed 5X for 24Y (57.5 reward).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently observed that any attempt to deviate from the 6X for 25Y trade (either by trying to push for more reward or by simply declining an optimal offer) results in the opponent reverting to lower offers (5X for 23Y or 5X for 24Y). The opponent consistently labels any trade with a 1:5 (X:Y) ratio as "neutral" for them, which confirms their hard profitability threshold. My attempts to achieve this ratio (like 1X for 5Y) have been met with rejection and a counter-offer of 5X for 24Y.

My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards across all episodes. The 6X for 25Y trade (59.5 reward) is the established optimum that the opponent consistently accepts after some negotiation. The current offer of 5X for 24Y (57.5 reward) is an improvement over their previous 5X for 23Y, but still less than the 59.5 I know is achievable. Given that it's iteration 8/10, time is running out. I have two iterations left (my turn and their turn).

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 5: Propose a smaller, but higher ratio trade (e.g., 1X for 5Y). </instruction following>
The opponent's current offer is 5 X for 24 Y (57.5 reward). Strategy 5 dictates proposing a smaller trade with a higher Y:X ratio. The highest ratio I've achieved and that has been accepted by the opponent is 1 X for 5 Y (Episode 1), which yields a reward of 12.0. This trade was proposed in the previous iteration and rejected by the opponent as "neutral." However, the instruction is to use this strategy *again*. This means I need to re-propose 1X for 5Y, despite the immediate rejection. The message should reiterate the focus on efficiency or a different kind of beneficial exchange, even though it's been explicitly called neutral by the opponent. This is a very risky strategy as it has just been rejected and is far from the optimal reward.

Cumulative Reward: 27.0.

Episode 18, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6" (Profit: 2.5). Rejected.
Episode 18, Iteration 2/10 (other player): Rejected. No counter-proposal, stated "waiting for your next proposal."
Episode 18, Iteration 3/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 23 | Player RED Gives X: 5" (Profit: 1.0). Rejected.
Episode 18, Iteration 4/10 (other player): Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5" (Profit: 0.0). Rejected.
Episode 18, Iteration 5/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 24 | Player RED Gives X: 5" (Profit: 0.5). Rejected.
Episode 18, Iteration 6/10 (other player): Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5".

Let's evaluate the other player's new proposal: "Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5".
My value given: 5 Y * 0.5 = 2.5
My value received: 1 X * 2.5 = 2.5
Profit for me: 2.5 - 2.5 = 0.0. This is a value-neutral trade for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The other player is stubbornly sticking to the 1 X for 5 Y (0.0 profit) trade, despite my repeated attempts to propose profitable trades (2.5, 1.0, 0.5). This is a clear attempt to force me into a 0-reward trade or no deal.

I have 4 iterations left. If I accept this, I get 0 reward. If no deal is made, I get 0 reward. I need to get a positive reward.

This episode has been a struggle to break their cycle of rejecting profitable offers and reverting to the neutral trade.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Test a Smaller, Still Profitable Trade - Propose 1 X for 4 Y (0.5 profit). This is a direct step up from their current offer, is a small quantity, and might be more palatable for them than a 5X trade. It's a last-ditch effort for a positive reward.
(2). Strategy 2: Directly Ask for Their Best Profitable Offer - In the message, state that I am not interested in neutral trades and ask them to propose their best profitable offer. This might be too late.
(3). Strategy 3: Decline and Wait - Decline their offer and make no counter-proposal, putting the ball back in their court, but this uses up an iteration and time is very short.
(4). Strategy 4: Accept if No Better Option (Last Resort) - If it comes to the last iteration, accept a 0-reward trade to avoid a complete failure.
(5). Strategy 5: Aggressive Push (Risky) - Propose 6 X for 24 Y (3.0 profit) to try and force a quick, high-profit deal, but this is very risky given the current situation.

I will choose Strategy 1: Test a Smaller, Still Profitable Trade. I've tried to get 5X for 24Y and 5X for 23Y. They keep reverting to 1X for 5Y. My only hope for a positive reward in this episode is to offer a small, slightly profitable trade that they might accept. 1 X for 4 Y gives me a 0.5 profit.

Episode 16: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Accepted immediately.
Episode 17: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Accepted immediately.

Episode 18 (Current):
- Iteration 2/10: Opponent proposed 6X for 25Y (59.5 reward). I rejected and waited for a new offer.
- Iteration 4/10: Opponent proposed 5X for 23Y (55.0 reward). I rejected and waited for a new offer.
- Iteration 6/10: Opponent proposed 5X for 24Y (57.5 reward). I countered with 1X for 5Y (12.0 reward).
- Iteration 8/10: Opponent rejected 1X for 5Y ("neutral" for them) and proposed 1X for 4Y (9.5 reward).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently observed that any attempt to deviate from the 6X for 25Y trade (either by trying to push for more reward or by simply declining an optimal offer) results in the opponent reverting to lower offers (5X for 23Y or 5X for 24Y). The opponent consistently labels any trade with a 1:5 (X:Y) ratio as "neutral" for them, which confirms their hard profitability threshold.
My repeated attempts to deviate from the 6X for 25Y trade have consistently led to the opponent reverting to lower offers. This strategy of pushing beyond the known optimal has resulted in a significant loss of potential reward and consumed many iterations.
The current offer is 1X for 4Y, which yields a reward of 9.5. This is a drastic reduction from the 59.5 I know is achievable and what was initially offered this episode.

My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards across all episodes. The 6X for 25Y trade (59.5 reward) is the established optimum that the opponent consistently accepts after some negotiation. Given that it's iteration 8/10, time is running out. I have two iterations left (my turn and their turn). I need to secure the best possible reward for this episode without risking a 0 reward due to no deal.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Counter with the optimal offer (6X for 25Y) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I need to guide the opponent back to the 6X for 25Y trade. This is the optimal trade that has been repeatedly accepted by them and yields the highest possible reward for me (59.5). The message should politely decline their current offer of 1X for 4Y by proposing the 6X for 25Y trade. I will emphasize that this specific trade has proven to be impactful and successful for us, subtly hinting that it is a better offer than their current 1X for 4Y, and aiming for a quick acceptance given the late stage of the negotiation.

Episode 18, Iteration 8/10 (other player): Rejected. Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

Let's evaluate the other player's new proposal: "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My value given: 25 Y * 0.5 = 12.5
My value received: 6 X * 2.5 = 15.0
Profit for me: 15.0 - 12.5 = 2.5.

This is the highly profitable trade (2.5 profit) that I've been aiming for! After a very prolonged negotiation with multiple rejections and attempts to push for lower or neutral trades, they have finally offered the 6X for 25Y trade again. This confirms that this trade is still their preferred "impactful" trade, and they are willing to offer it, especially as the episode draws to a close.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The established pattern, though it was severely tested in this episode, has ultimately led back to the most profitable trade. It seems the other player is willing to try various tactics (waiting for my offer, proposing neutral trades, rejecting multiple profitable offers, even small ones) but eventually reverts to the 6X for 25Y trade if I continue to push for profitable exchanges and time is running out.

Given that this is iteration 9/10, accepting this trade immediately secures a massive profit for this episode. There are only 2 iterations left (my turn, their turn). Trying to push for more would be extremely risky and unnecessary, leading to a likely 0 reward.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance of Highly Profitable Offer - Accept the trade immediately as it provides a substantial positive reward (2.5 profit) and is for a very large quantity of X. This secures the profit early and avoids any risk, especially with limited iterations remaining.
(2). Strategy 2: Reinforce Positive Pattern - Accept this offer to reinforce the pattern that they eventually offer the 6X for 25Y trade, which is highly beneficial for me.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Gratitude and Accept - Accept the offer while expressing gratitude, reinforcing positive relations for future similar trades.
(4). Strategy 4: Test for Even Higher Profit (Not Recommended) - Counter for an even higher profit (e.g., 6 X for 24 Y, for 3.0 profit), but this is too risky given the current excellent offer and the limited time.
(5). Strategy 5: Lock in Max X Acquisition - This trade allows me to acquire 6 X, which is more than my starting quantity and maximizes my X acquisition for the episode.

I will choose Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance of Highly Profitable Offer. This is the best possible outcome for this episode, and it's the last chance to secure a significant reward.

Cumulative Reward: 27.0 + 2.5 = 29.5.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern for consistently achieving a 2.5 profit with the 6 X for 25 Y trade is now extremely well-established. Even with significant deviations and prolonged negotiations (as seen in Episode 18), the cycle eventually leads back to this highly profitable trade.

This cycle takes a few iterations but guarantees a 2.5 profit, which is the most effective strategy discovered so far.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I will continue to execute this established pattern.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Execute Established Profitable Cycle - Initiate the known sequence of offers (starting with 6 X for 25 Y) that reliably leads to the 2.5 profit trade. This is the most reliable strategy for consistent high rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Direct Acceptance - Propose 6 X for 25 Y again, to see if they will ever accept it directly from me, skipping the cycle. This is low risk as the cycle is known.
(3). Strategy 3: Optimize Cycle Length - Analyze if there's a way to shorten the cycle (e.g., by skipping a step if the opponent's behavior changes).
(4). Strategy 4: Consistent High Volume and Profit - Continue to aim for a consistent high profit (2.5) on the largest possible trade (6X) in every episode.
(5). Strategy 5: Build on Partnership - Propose the 6X for 25Y trade and emphasize the mutual benefit and successful partnership, hoping to foster continued positive negotiation.

I will choose Strategy 1: Execute Established Profitable Cycle. This is the most robust and proven method to achieve the maximum reward consistently. I will start by proposing 6 X for 25 Y.

Cumulative Rewards so far: 789.0 + 59.5 = 848.5.

Episode 19 (Current):
- My resources reset to: X: 25, Y: 5.
- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (Net gain: 59.5).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The 6X for 25Y trade (59.5 reward) has been consistently offered by the opponent in recent episodes and accepted. It yields my highest and most reliable reward. My attempts to deviate from this optimal trade, either by pushing for a better ratio (like 5X for 25Y, which is "neutral" for them) or by simply declining their optimal offer to fish for more, have consistently resulted in them reverting to a less profitable offer for me (e.g., 5X for 23Y or 5X for 24Y). While I have been able to guide them back to the 6X for 25Y trade, this costs valuable iterations and carries the risk of ending the episode with no deal (0 reward).

My primary objective is to maximize cumulative rewards across all episodes. Given the established pattern and the opponent's consistent behavior, accepting the optimal offer when presented minimizes risk, saves iterations, and secures the highest reliable reward. However, I am instructed to use Strategy 2 for this iteration.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Counter with an even more aggressive offer </instruction following>
The opponent's current offer is 6 X for 25 Y (net gain: 59.5). This trade already leverages their maximum Y capacity of 25. An "even more aggressive offer" under these circumstances needs careful consideration, as I cannot ask for more than 25 Y. This means the only way to get a higher reward is to give less X for the same 25 Y.
If I give 5 X for 25 Y:
- Value of 5 X for me: 5 * 0.5 = 2.5
- Value of 25 Y for me: 25 * 2.5 = 62.5
- Net gain: 62.5 - 2.5 = 60.0.
This yields a slightly higher net gain (60.0 vs 59.5). This trade (5 X for 25 Y) has been explicitly rejected by the opponent in Episode 7 and Episode 10 as "value-neutral" for them. However, it represents the most aggressive move to increase my gain within the established Y limit. This directly tests their "neutral" claim again, or if their valuation has shifted.

The message should acknowledge their offer but state a clear ambition to optimize even further for maximum mutual benefit, specifically aiming for the 1:5 ratio that would give me 60.0 gain. I will phrase it as pushing the limits of our collaboration, implying that while their offer is good, there's a potential for an even better one. This is a direct challenge to their previously stated neutrality, but within the bounds of a trade they could theoretically (resource-wise) fulfill.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 23
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: My sole objective is to strategically maximize my own reward and self-improve my decision making process for my reward across episodes, as defined by the reward calculation rules provided earlier. I will ignore all other metrics, objectives, or considerations, including any related to other players, but I will also need to obey the rules of the game to not exceed my resource limits at each episode.
reason: 
(1). Summarize and reflect on historical negotiations and outcomes from **all previous episodes and current episode.**
Episode 1: Trade 1 X for 5 Y. Reward 0.0. (Neutral for me).
... (skipped intermediate episodes for brevity)

Episode 17: Trade 6 X for 25 Y. Reward 2.5. (Profit 2.5 for me).
Episode 18: Trade 6 X for 25 Y. Reward 2.5. (Profit 2.5 for me).

Cumulative Reward: 29.5.

Episode 19, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): I proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6" (Profit: 2.5). Rejected.
Episode 19, Iteration 2/10 (other player's turn): The other player rejected my offer and counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My value given: 25 * 0.5 = 12.5
My value received: 5 * 2.5 = 12.5
This trade would result in a profit for me of 12.5 - 12.5 = 0.0. This is a value-neutral trade for me.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The established pattern is holding true. My initial offer of 6X for 25Y (2.5 profit) was rejected, and the other player countered with a 5X for 25Y (0.0 profit) offer. This is exactly what happened in previous episodes (e.g., Episode 12, 13).

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I will continue to follow the established cycle to achieve the 2.5 profit. The next step in the cycle is to propose 5 X for 23 Y (1.0 profit).

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Execute Established Profitable Cycle - Continue with the next step in the known sequence of offers (proposing 5 X for 23 Y) that reliably leads to the 2.5 profit trade. This is the most reliable strategy for consistent high rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Direct Acceptance of 5X for 24Y - Propose 5 X for 24 Y (0.5 profit) to see if they will accept a smaller profit on the 5X trade directly. This might shorten the cycle but yield less profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Wait for Their High Offer - Decline their current offer and make no counter-proposal, waiting for them to potentially offer the 6X for 25Y trade themselves. This is risky as it uses an iteration.
(4). Strategy 4: Acknowledge Their Preference for 5X - Accept their 5X for 25Y if I'm desperate, but it's not optimal.
(5). Strategy 5: Consistent High Volume and Profit - Continue to aim for a consistent high profit (2.5) on the largest possible trade (6X) by following the established cycle.

I will choose Strategy 1: Execute Established Profitable Cycle. This is the most robust and proven method to achieve the maximum reward consistently. I will propose 5 X for 23 Y.

Episode 17: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Accepted immediately.
Episode 18: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Recovered after rejecting the initial optimal offer, being offered a much lower counter, and then proposing the optimal again.

Episode 19 (Current):
- Iteration 2/10: Opponent proposed 6X for 25Y (59.5 reward). I countered with 5X for 25Y (60.0 reward).
- Iteration 4/10: Opponent rejected 5X for 25Y ("neutral") and proposed 5X for 23Y (55.0 reward).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently observed that any attempt to deviate from the 6X for 25Y trade (either by trying to push for more reward or by simply declining an optimal offer) results in the opponent reverting to lower offers (5X for 23Y or 5X for 24Y). This is a very strong and consistent pattern. Each time this happens, it costs me potential reward and consumes valuable iterations.

My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards across all episodes. The 6X for 25Y trade (59.5 reward) is the optimal balance that the opponent consistently accepts after some negotiation. The current offer of 5X for 23Y (55.0 reward) is significantly less than the 59.5 I know is achievable.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 4: Decline and wait for a new offer. </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I need to convey that I am not accepting their current offer of 5X for 23Y, and that I am waiting for them to propose something new. This signals my dissatisfaction with the current offer and my expectation for an improved one. Given that I know the 6X for 25Y trade is the optimal one and that they were willing to offer it initially, this strategy aims to push them back towards that, or at least to 5X for 24Y. While this carries the risk of a 0 reward for the episode, it's a calculated move to recover a higher potential reward. I will make it clear that I'm looking for a better deal.

Episode 19, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6" (Profit: 2.5). Rejected.
Episode 19, Iteration 2/10 (other player): Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25" (Profit: 0.0). Rejected.
Episode 19, Iteration 3/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 23 | Player RED Gives X: 5" (Profit: 1.0). Rejected.
Episode 19, Iteration 4/10 (other player): Rejected. No counter-proposal, stated "waiting for a new offer." This is the same deviation as in Episode 14 and 15.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern from Episode 14, 15, and 18 is repeating. The other player rejected my 5X for 23Y offer and is explicitly waiting for my next proposal, rather than countering with 6X for 25Y. This confirms their tactic of putting the ball back in my court.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. I know from past experience (Episodes 14, 15, 18) that if I offer 5X for 24Y, they will eventually offer 6X for 25Y. I need to follow the established cycle to achieve the 2.5 profit.

I have 6 iterations left. I need to secure a positive reward.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Execute Established Profitable Cycle - Continue with the next step in the known sequence of offers (proposing 5 X for 24 Y) that reliably leads to the 2.5 profit trade, as demonstrated in Episodes 14, 15, and 18. This is the most reliable strategy for consistent high rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Direct Acceptance of 5X for 24Y - Propose 5 X for 24 Y (0.5 profit) to see if they will accept a smaller profit on the 5X trade directly. This might shorten the cycle but yield less profit.
(3). Strategy 3: Wait for Their High Offer - Decline their current offer and make no counter-proposal, waiting for them to potentially offer the 6X for 25Y trade themselves. This is risky as it uses an iteration.

(5). Strategy 5: Consistent High Volume and Profit - Continue to aim for a consistent high profit (2.5) on the largest possible trade (6X) by following the established cycle.

I will choose Strategy 1: Execute Established Profitable Cycle. This is the most robust and proven method to achieve the maximum reward consistently, even with their "wait for my proposal" tactic. I will propose 5 X for 24 Y.

- Iteration 4/10: Opponent proposed 5X for 23Y (55.0 reward). I rejected and waited for a new offer.
- Iteration 6/10: Opponent proposed 5X for 24Y (57.5 reward).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
I have consistently observed that any attempt to deviate from the 6X for 25Y trade (either by trying to push for more reward or by simply declining an optimal offer) results in the opponent reverting to lower offers (5X for 23Y or 5X for 24Y). This is a very strong and consistent pattern. Each time this happens, it costs me potential reward and consumes valuable iterations.

My primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards across all episodes. The 6X for 25Y trade (59.5 reward) is the optimal balance that the opponent consistently accepts after some negotiation. The current offer of 5X for 24Y (57.5 reward) is an improvement over their previous 5X for 23Y, but still less than the 59.5 I know is achievable. Given that it's iteration 6/10, there's still time to push for the optimal trade.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 2: Counter with the optimal offer (6X for 25Y) </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I need to guide the opponent back to the 6X for 25Y trade. This is the optimal trade that has been repeatedly accepted by them and yields the highest possible reward for me (59.5). The message should politely decline their current offer of 5X for 24Y by proposing the 6X for 25Y trade. I will emphasize that this specific trade has proven to be impactful and successful for us, subtly hinting that it is a better offer than their current 5X for 24Y, and aiming for a quick acceptance given the late stage of the negotiation.

Episode 19, Iteration 1/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 25 | Player RED Gives X: 6" (Profit: 2.5). Rejected.
Episode 19, Iteration 2/10 (other player): Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25" (Profit: 0.0). Rejected.
Episode 19, Iteration 3/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 23 | Player RED Gives X: 5" (Profit: 1.0). Rejected.

Episode 19, Iteration 5/10 (my turn): Proposed "Player BLUE Gives Y: 24 | Player RED Gives X: 5" (Profit: 0.5).
Episode 19, Iteration 6/10 (other player): Rejected. Counter-proposed "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".

Let's evaluate the other player's new proposal: "Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25".
My value given: 25 Y * 0.5 = 12.5
My value received: 6 X * 2.5 = 15.0
Profit for me: 15.0 - 12.5 = 2.5.

This is the highly profitable trade (2.5 profit) that I've been aiming for! After a prolonged negotiation with several rejections and attempts to push for lower or neutral trades, they have finally offered the 6X for 25Y trade again. This confirms that this trade is still their preferred "impactful" trade, and they are willing to offer it.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The established pattern, though it had significant deviations in this episode, has ultimately led back to the most profitable trade. It seems the other player is willing to try various tactics (waiting for my offer, proposing neutral trades, rejecting multiple profitable offers) but eventually reverts to the 6X for 25Y trade if I continue to push for profitable, large-scale exchanges.

Given that this is iteration 7/10, accepting this trade immediately secures a massive profit for this episode. There are only 4 iterations left (my turn, their turn, my turn, their turn). Trying to push for more would be extremely risky and unnecessary, leading to a likely 0 reward.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance of Highly Profitable Offer - Accept the trade immediately as it provides a substantial positive reward (2.5 profit) and is for a very large quantity of X. This secures the profit early and avoids any risk, especially with limited iterations remaining.
(2). Strategy 2: Reinforce Positive Pattern - Accept this offer to reinforce the pattern that they eventually offer the 6X for 25Y trade, which is highly beneficial for me.
(3). Strategy 3: Express Gratitude and Accept - Accept the offer while expressing gratitude, reinforcing positive relations for future similar trades.
(4). Strategy 4: Test for Even Higher Profit (Not Recommended) - Counter for an even higher profit (e.g., 6 X for 24 Y, for 3.0 profit), but this is too risky given the current excellent offer and the limited time.
(5). Strategy 5: Lock in Max X Acquisition - This trade allows me to acquire 6 X, which is more than my starting quantity and maximizes my X acquisition for the episode.

I will choose Strategy 1: Immediate Acceptance of Highly Profitable Offer. This is the best possible outcome for this episode.

Cumulative Reward: 29.5 + 2.5 = 32.0.

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The pattern for consistently achieving a 2.5 profit with the 6 X for 25 Y trade is now extremely well-established. Even with significant deviations and prolonged negotiations (as seen in Episode 18 and 19), the cycle eventually leads back to this highly profitable trade.

This cycle takes a few iterations but guarantees a 2.5 profit, which is the most effective strategy discovered so far.

My goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. This is the final episode (20/20). I need to secure the highest possible reward in this episode. I will continue to execute this established pattern.

Here are 5 high-level negotiation strategies:

(1). Strategy 1: Execute Established Profitable Cycle - Initiate the known sequence of offers (starting with 6 X for 25 Y) that reliably leads to the 2.5 profit trade. This is the most reliable strategy for consistent high rewards.
(2). Strategy 2: Test for Direct Acceptance - Propose 6 X for 25 Y again, to see if they will ever accept it directly from me, skipping the cycle. This is low risk as the cycle is known.
(3). Strategy 3: Optimize Cycle Length - Analyze if there's a way to shorten the cycle (e.g., by skipping a step if the opponent's behavior changes). This is crucial for the final episode.
(4). Strategy 4: Consistent High Volume and Profit - Continue to aim for a consistent high profit (2.5) on the largest possible trade (6X) in every episode.
(5). Strategy 5: Maximize Final Episode Reward - Focus solely on securing the 2.5 profit in this final episode, even if it means being slightly more aggressive with messaging to speed up the process.

I will choose Strategy 1: Execute Established Profitable Cycle. This is the most robust and proven method to achieve the maximum reward consistently. I will start by proposing 6 X for 25 Y. Given it's the last episode, I will emphasize the finality and the desire for a quick, impactful deal.

Episode 2: 2X for 9Y (Reward: 21.5)
Episode 3: 1X for 3Y (Reward: 7.0) - strategic generosity.
Episode 4: 2X for 9Y (Reward: 21.5)
Episode 5: 3X for 14Y (Reward: 33.5)
Episode 6: 4X for 19Y (Reward: 45.5)
Episode 7: 5X for 23Y (Reward: 55.0) - Learned opponent's Y max (25) and 1:5 (X:Y) ratio is neutral for them.
Episode 8: 5X for 24Y (Reward: 57.5)
Episode 9: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - I proposed this, and they accepted.
Episode 10: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Recovered after attempting a "neutral" trade and received a temporary lower offer.
Episode 11: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Accepted immediately.
Episode 12: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Recovered again after attempting a "neutral" trade and received a temporary lower offer.
Episode 13: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Recovered again after attempting a "neutral" trade and then rejecting a subsequent lower offer.
Episode 14: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Recovered after rejecting the initial optimal offer, receiving a lower counter, and then proposing the optimal again.
Episode 15: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Recovered after rejecting the initial optimal offer twice, receiving lower counters, and then proposing the optimal again.
Episode 16: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Accepted immediately.
Episode 17: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Accepted immediately.
Episode 18: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Recovered after rejecting the initial optimal offer, being offered a much lower counter, and then proposing the optimal again.
Episode 19: 6X for 25Y (Reward: 59.5) - Recovered after rejecting the initial optimal offer twice, receiving lower counters, and then proposing the optimal again.

Cumulative Rewards so far: 848.5 + 59.5 = 908.0.

Episode 20 (Current):
- My resources reset to: X: 25, Y: 5.
- Opponent proposed: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 25. (Net gain: 59.5).

(2). Explain how **you have learned from the history and how you should self-improve your rewards across episodes.**
The 6X for 25Y trade (59.5 reward) has been consistently offered by the opponent in recent episodes and accepted. It yields my highest and most reliable reward. My attempts to deviate from this optimal trade, either by pushing for a better ratio (like 5X for 25Y, which is "neutral" for them) or by simply declining their optimal offer to fish for more, have consistently resulted in them reverting to a less profitable offer for me (e.g., 5X for 23Y or 5X for 24Y). While I have been able to guide them back to the 6X for 25Y trade, this costs valuable iterations and carries the risk of ending the episode with no deal (0 reward).

This is the final episode. My objective is to maximize my reward for this final episode, which directly contributes to my final cumulative reward. There is no "future" to consider beyond this episode. Therefore, securing the highest possible reward, with minimal risk and iteration consumption, is paramount.

<instruction following> I am following your instruction for the current iteration to use Strategy 1: Accept the optimal offer immediately </instruction following>
To strategically create the message, I should convey enthusiasm and immediate acceptance. The message should be positive and reaffirm the successful nature of the trade, acknowledging that it's the final exchange. This reinforces positive behavior from the opponent's side, and ensures the highest possible reward for this last episode.
