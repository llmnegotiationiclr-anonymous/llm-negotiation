# Opponent Simulation as Inference-Time Scaling for Self-Improving Agents: Case Study of Repeated Negotiations

### Example Outputs
Example negotiation dialogues between our algorithm and the baselines are stored in the `Example-outputs/` folder.

For each game in each setting, we provide 10 runs. Each run consists of 20 episodes, and each episode contains 10 time steps.
```
Example-outputs/Buyer-seller/Player-as-buyer: our algorithm plays as the buyer (BLUE)
Example-outputs/Buyer-seller/Player-as-seller: our algorithm plays as the seller (RED)
Example-outputs/Resource-exchange/Start-first: our algorithm takes the first turn (RED)
Example-outputs/Resource-exchange/Start-second: our algorithm takes the second turn (BLUE)
